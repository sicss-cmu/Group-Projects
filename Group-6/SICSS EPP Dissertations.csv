26VRW7LF,thesis,2014,"Harish, Santosh Maddur",Access to Electricity in Rural India Tradeoffs and Interventions for Meaningful Electrification,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Access_to_Electricity_in_Rural_India_Tradeoffs_and_Interventions_for_Meaningful_Electrification/6714551/1,"This thesis investigates the engineering economics of interventions to reduce consumer inconvenience due to unreliable electricity supply in rural India. The work introduces and applies a novel approach to estimate interruption costs as loss in consumer surplus due to restricted consumption of electricity services. Chapter 2 reports an assessment that compares grid extension with distributed generation (DG) alternatives, based on the subsidies they will necessitate, and costs of service interruptions that are appropriate in the rural Indian context. Despite the inclusion of interruption costs, standalone DG does not appear to be competitive with grid extension at distances of less than 17 km. However, backing up unreliable grid service with local DG plants is attractive when reliability is very poor, even in previously electrified villages. Introduction of energy efficient lighting changes these economics, and the threshold for acceptable grid unreliability significantly reduces. Chapter 3 analyzes supply rostering (alternatively, “load shedding”) in metropolitan, small town and rural feeders in and around Bangalore city. The inequity in load shedding is analyzed through transfers due to differential tariffs between the urban and rural residential consumers, and the relief provided to BESCOM, through avoided procurement of additional supply from generators, because rural and small town feeders are load shed higher than Bangalore city. The values of the load shedding transfers are estimated to be in the range of Rs. 120-380/consumer-year from the rural consumers, and Rs. 220- 370/consumer-year from the small town consumers. The metropolitan consumers are found to be net beneficiaries. The viability of using smart meters to provide current limited but uninterrupted supply is investigated as one alternative to outright blackouts. Chapter 4 develops a broader theoretical framework that can be used to model consumer demand for electricity services with unreliable supply and adaptation. Demand for energy ‘services’ is modeled by incorporating time of use, duration and deferability. Supply reliability is disaggregated into its constituent dimensions– mean and variance of supply availability in times of high demand, and supply predictability, and their respective impacts on consumer welfare are discussed. Primary data collected from Karnataka inform the discussion, especially with backup adoption. New consumer-oriented reliability indices are proposed.",8/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:57,5/20/25 15:23,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714551.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/NZ4UUPDX/Harish - 2014 - Access to Electricity in Rural India Tradeoffs and Interventions for Meaningful Electrification.pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis models two leading post-combustion CO2 capture technologies, a chilled ammonia-based CO2 capture process and an advanced amine-based CO2 capture process, and presents performance and cost estimates of these systems on pulverized coal and natural gas combined cycle power plants. The process modeling software package Aspen Plus® was used to develop performance and cost estimates for the chilled ammonia-based CO2 capture technology and general response surface equations were created for the model. Assumptions about plant financing and utilization, as well as uncertainties in cooling costs and chemical reaction rates that affect absorber cost were found to produce a wide range of cost estimates for ammonia-based CO2 capture systems. With uncertainties included, costs for a supercritical power plant with ammonia-based CO2 capture ranged from $80/MWh to $160/MWh, with the 95% confidence interval ranging from $95/MWh to $143/MWh (with all costs in constant 2007 US dollars). For the advanced amine-based CO2 capture technology, an existing amine-based response surface model developed using Protreat® simulations was modified to match the performance and cost characteristics of a modern amine-based system. The response surface models of both technologies were incorporated into the Integrated Environmental Control Model for use in developing performance and cost estimates of pulverized coal and natural gas combined cycle power plants with these technologies. The baseline costs for a supercritical power plant with advanced amine-based CO2 capture was $105/MWh and for the natural gas combined cycle power plant with advanced amine-based CO2 capture was $85/MWh. Both post-combustion CO2 capture technologies are then compared in terms of performance and cost for different ranges of fuel type, fuel cost, plant size, and CO2 capture system train size. A probabilistic cost difference analysis is also used to compare these technologies. The aminebased CO2 capture system is found to have a higher revenue requirement in all the case studies and only a 2% chance of having a lower revenue requirement than the advanced amine system in the probabilistic cost difference. Combined, these results suggest that the advanced amine system will have a cost advantage over the ammonia system in most cases, in the absence of significant new improvements in the ammonia system design. Finally, the importance of these estimates for policy makers is discussed.",5/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:23,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714605.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/JLTUMHF2/Versteeg - 2012 - Advanced Amine and Ammonia Systems for Greenhouse Gas Control at Fossil Fuel Power Plants.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GXR4J62B,thesis,2014,"Jenn, Alan Theodore",Advanced and Alternative Fuel Vehicle Policies: Regulations and Incentives in the United States,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Advanced_and_Alternative_Fuel_Vehicle_Policies_Regulations_and_Incentives_in_the_United_States/6714608/1,"Transportation policy is playing an increasingly important role in the transition towards more fuel-efficient vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). Whether the policy seeks to promote adoption through mandatory requirements or through monetary incentives, or to address issues related to adoption of AFVs, it is clear that such policies can have large-ranging impacts on the future of the US transportation system. The work I conduct in my dissertation seeks to understand these policies, in the past, present, and future. I evaluate the effects of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT) on the adoption of HEVs. As part of EPACT, a tax credit incentives program was implemented for consumers purchasing HEVs. Using a unique fixed effects regression approach with lagged instrumental variables, I am able to estimate the effects of the incentives. I find most significant responses occur when incentives exceed $1,000 in tax cd credit. Depending on the vehicle model the presence of EPACT yielded increases in sales of 5% to 15%. This increase is relatively smaller compared to many existing studies, which my work indicates is likely the result of over-attribution of sales to policy. I go on to examine the effects of the adoption of electric vehicles on funding for transportation infrastructure. A significant portion of revenue for transportation infrastructure comes from taxes on gasoline, these funds will likely be diminished to some extent as electric vehicles are adopted as they consume little to no gasoline as fuel. Using several existing electric vehicle models, I find that at the per-vehicle level, revenue generation can be upwards of 50% lower in certain states depending on how fees are charged. The total annual revenue generation at the federal level could decrease by as much as $200 million by 2025, though this is quite a small portion of total revenues for transportation infrastructure. I demonstrate that the revenue decrease can easily be made up through small policy fee changes in either flat fixed or through incremental increases in use fees, though implementation of such policies can be difficult politically. I also focus on the recent implementation of alternative fuel vehicle incentives in the 2009 update of the CAFE standards. I demonstrate that while the AFV incentives help spur the production and adoption of AFVs, there is a short-term emissions penalty due to the structure of the policy. i find that every AFV sold results in an increase in emissions rate for another vehicle of 50-400 grams of CO2 per mile, comparable to adding an additional conventional vehicle onto the road. The cumulative effect is an increase of 20 to 70 million metric tons of CO2 for vehicles sold between 2012 and 2025. I further extends this work by investigating how other policies promoting AFV sales interact with the CAFE policy. I focus specifically on the California ZEV mandate interaction and find that there is an increase of 120 million metric tons of CO2 for new cars sold between 2012 and 2025. The analysis also demonstrates a counter intuitive effect: the greater the success of ZEV in inducing adoption of AFVs, the greater the short-term emissions penalty due to the two policies. Finally I examines the response of driving behavior response to changes in gasoline prices. Using a unique dataset obtained from Pennsylvania's Department of Transportation, we are able to observe annual driving behavior at the individual vehicle level from 2000 through 2010. We observe heterogeneity of price elasticities using two methods: separating data by quantiles over the factors of interest and by interacting the factors of interest as categorical variables with gasoline prices. We find statistically significant variations in elasticities: for driving intensities we observe values of -0.172 increasing up to -0.0576 as the amount driven annually increases, for gasoline prices we observe a range of elasticities from -0.002 to -0.05 for prices below $4/gallon with a sudden increase to -0.182 for prices above $4/gallon, lastly for fuel economies we find that below 20 MPG elasticities are highest at -0.173 with decreasing responsiveness as vehicle fuel economy increases. Heterogeneity needs to be accounted for in order to properly understand policy effects: responses based on average elasticity values are likely to be incorrect.",5/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:23,,,,,,,Advanced and Alternative Fuel Vehicle Policies,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714608.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/4XFN3KPX/Jenn - 2014 - Advanced and Alternative Fuel Vehicle Policies Regulations and Incentives in the United States.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This heavily fossil fuel dependent generation mix contributes to approximately 30% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Energy efficiency (EE) and renewable energy (RE) are two ways to reduce the carbon footprint of our electricity sector. This dissertation addresses the decision-making behavior of actors in and across the commercial, residential and educational sectors on the adoption of EE and RE technologies in the U.S. This work characterizes the barriers and motivations to adoption as well as the associated health and environmental benefits from offsetting electricity generated by fossil fuel power plants.In Chapter 2, I employ an interview study to explore the behavioral and social factors in commercial building energy efficiency investment decision-making and to clarify the distinction between influences related to Economics/Technology and Psychology/Context. I find heterogeneity among interviewed experts and owners/managers regarding the value of corporate social responsibility (CSR). I also find that the relationship between owners/managers and their building engineering team heavily influences decision-making. Finally, the interviews reveal potentially promising new concepts related to psychological and social influences in the EE investment decision domain.Chapter 3 focuses on the residential sector and details findings from two studies evaluating the effect of a clean energy campaign on civic engagement (e.g. signing a petition) among parents already taking advocacy actions (i.e. advocacy sample) and those who aren’t (i.e. public sample). Among our public sample, I find that participants who believe the campaign to be credible and comprehendible are more likely to take action than those who discredit the campaign or do not understand its message. Additionally, I find parents who have children under the age of 18 negatively adjust their attitudes towards fossil fuels after being presented with health information.Finally, in Chapter 4, I focus on the educational sector and employ a benefit-cost analysis (BCA) to determine which states in the U.S. will benefit most from installing solar photovoltaic (PV) on their educational facilities and which PV projects are financially feasible. I find that solar PV in U.S. educational institutions can provide 100 TWh of electricity services annually, meeting 75% of these buildings current electricity consumption. The provision of electricity services from rooftop solar PV on educational institutions can reduce environmental, health and climate change damages by roughly $4 billion per year.Discussed in Chapter 5 are this work’s contribution to the literature and the policy implications regarding the adoption of EE and RE among various actors revealed in Chapters 2 through 4. For instance, findings from Chapter 2 suggest that policy makers should consider non-economic factors related to EE adoption, such as the relationship between owners and building engineers. In Chapter 3, I learn that campaigns can inspire civic engagement among residential consumers if campaign materials are perceived credible and advocacy actions seem effective. In Chapter 4, results detail which regions in the U.S. stand to benefit the most from installing PV on their educational buildings and provides a baseline analysis for efficient incentive design.",8/10/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7218389.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it would be technically possible to make changesthat could sustain many critical electricity-dependent services during widespread and longlastingoutages by implementing smart grid technologies, distributed generation resources, andother technologies, these technologies would require incremental investments where the benefitsare uncertain and difficult to quantify in many cases.For many years, distribution utilities in United States have conducted studies of the value thatcustomers place on reliable electric services. However, these studies and associated literaturesuffer from several shortcomings: they have not devoted much effort to help respondents fullyunderstand and consider the various implications of hypothetical outages that respondents maynot have experienced nor previously considered; they have done little to minimize cognitivebiases; they have focused almost exclusively on brief outages that last only up to a few hours;and, they have only considered the difference between full backup service and no service. Hence,their results are not adequate to assess how much individuals or society might, or should, bewilling to avoid longer outages or provide full or limited backup service in the event of largeoutages of long duration.To address these issues, we have developed and demonstrated a set of improved methods thathelp residential customers think systematically about the value they attach to reliable electricservice and have used the elicited informed judgments to illustrate how the results could be usedfor local or regional-decision-making.After introducing the issues in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 summarizes a new elicitation framework thathas been designed to help residential electricity customers think carefully about the value they attach to reliable electric service. The survey framework was applied to a convenience sample ofresidents in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania to assess their willingness-to-pay to receive backupservices during a hypothetical 24-hour outage on a hot summer day. The face-to-face interviewresults suggest that there exists a considerable amount of consumer surplus associated withproviding partial electric backup service (i.e., the respondents’ willingness-to-pay per kWh issignificantly higher for their first bit of electricity than the value of the last amount consumed).Further, the assessed value of sustaining demands the respondents assessed to be high prioritysignificantly increased as they receive additional information and better understood the outagescenario and its consequences.In Chapter 3, we estimated the cost to implement to implement the capability to provide limitedemergency backup power service using isolated distribution feeders, evenly distributed theincremental investment costs across to all residential customers across outages, compared therequired service payment with the measured willingness-to-pay distribution, and exploredwhether and when such investments can be justified. We first conducted a series of order ofmagnitude calculations and found that providing the low-amperage backup service can be morecost-effective than buying a small portable generator and storing diesel or gasoline for refuelingeven if a 24-long outage occurs once every 20 years, and the backup service appears to be morecost-effective if a region is expected to suffer more frequent and longer outages. In addition tothe assessments using private willingness-to-pay, the chapter also considers two methods thatmight be used to recover system upgrade costs without raising a serious equity issue norimposing an excessive burden to either residential customers or the region.In order to explore respondents’ willingness-to-pay under a variety of scenarios for differentgeographical regions more efficiently, the face-to-face survey framework has been modified for online use. Chapter 4 first describes the details of the generalizable web-based survey frameworkthat a researcher or decision-maker can use to design ones’ own outage scenarios. It alsoaddresses several factors that are assumed to influence estimates from stated preference valuationstudies. The framework was then used to elicit the economic and social preferences for reliableelectric backup services during hypothetical 10-day widespread outages from a sample ofresidents of the Northeastern United States. We first demonstrated the importance of helpingrespondents fully consider the various aspects of the consequences of the hypothetical outagesand better articulate their values, and then used the elicited preferences to explore whether andhow much some of the factors that are known to affect respondents’ risk perceptions influencetheir willingness-to-pay values for reliable electric services during the hypothetical outages. Thechapter concludes with a discussion of why exploring preferences for reliable electric servicesunder a variety of scenarios and constructing customer damage functions for electricitycustomers are important, and what we see as future behavioral research needs.Finally, in Chapter 5, we discussed how the elicited preferences can be used to make moreinformed and collective societal decisions. Benefit-cost analysis and other forms of analysis havebeen widely used in policy analysis and government decision-making. However, onlyuncertainties about costs and physical states of the world are considered, neglecting uncertaintyabout the level of benefits that come from the value the public places on policy outcomes. In thischapter, we proposed such an approach that incorporates uncertainties in individual preferences.Using the public valuations of implementing smart grid technologies to mitigate impacts oflarge-regional outages, we showed uncertainty in individual preferences, when aggregated toform societal preference intervals, can substantially change the decision society would make.",9/6/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7207202.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37DS9W5P,thesis,2013,"Mitchell, Austin L.",Analysis of health and environmental risks associated with Marcellus Shale development,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Analysis_of_health_and_environmental_risks_associated_with_Marcellus_Shale_development/6714752/1,"The rapid growth of the shale gas industry has inspired questions concerning attendant apparent and potential short- and long-term health and environmental risks. My research examined three potential environmental and health risks. (1) For the last half-century the Northeast natural gas market was supplied from major producing areas in Texas, the Gulf Coast, and Canada. Because radon has a short half-life of 3.8 days, the time required to transport the natural gas from these areas to the Northeast resulted in a low-radon product being delivered to homes. As the Northeast gas market transitions to locally-produced natural gas the potential for radioactive decay will diminish and the natural gas being delivered to homes will contain radon at higher levels. I assess the lung cancer risk for people living in homes with unvented gas cooking (approximately half of the homes in the Northeast) and heating appliances, which are in fewer homes. Data on the locally-produced natural gas radon concentration are limited, but for the modeling assumptions considered the radon exposure is predicted to be small compared to typical residential exposures, and additional annual population-level risk will likely be much less than the error in the estimate of annual radon-induced lung cancers. An excess lifetime lung cancer risk >10-4 is possible for high gas usage in poorly ventilated settings. (2) High volume and locally-concentrated surface water withdrawals for Marcellus Shale development may pose a risk to water quality, aquatic and riparian ecosystems, and other uses of water resources. State environmental and interstate water authorities take different approaches to managing these water withdrawals. In the Upper Ohio River Basin, which covers the western third of Pennsylvania, the Department of Environmental Protection requires that all water used for shale gas development be covered by a water management plan. These plans stipulate the amount and timing of surface water withdrawals from each source as a function of annual stream flow statistics. Neighboring regulatory authorities and some environmental groups favor the use of monthly flow statistics instead, but implementation of these statistics in western Pennsylvania would require more data than are currently available. Because hydrologic data in the Upper Ohio River Basin are sparse, the use of the annual flow statistics is more likely than use of monthly flow statistics to prevent water withdrawals when aquatic ecosystems are under the greatest stress. The annual flow statistic might also result in fewer and smaller occurrences of computed ecodeficits under scenarios of development-related water demands in the future. (3) Improperly abandoned and orphan gas wells threaten human health and safety as well as pollute the air and water. Pennsylvania currently requires production companies to post a bond to ensure environmental reclamation of non-productive well sites, but the cost of plugging horizontally drilled wells and reclaiming well pads is estimated to be at least a factor of 10 greater than the current well bonds. The economics of shale gas development favor transfer of assets from large entities to smaller ones. With the assets go the liabilities, and without a mechanism to prevent the new owners from assuming reclamation liabilities beyond their means, the economics favor default on well-plugging and site restoration obligations. In addition to increasing the bond amounts, individual well trust accounts are proposed based on a model from the coal industry. Pre- and delayed-funding options (a fee and severance tax, respectively) to pay for future reclamation are examined from the perspective of the taxpayer. The exposure of the taxpayer to these financial liabilities and to a future orphan well problem can be minimized with minimal impacts to the profitability of gas production regardless of which funding option is used.",12/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:23,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714752.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/WKQUFB6J/Mitchell - 2013 - Analysis of health and environmental risks associated with Marcellus Shale development.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, issues involving ethanol production cost, emissions resulting from land use change, and infrastructure requirements may incur significant social costs. This dissertation examines social costs from different aspects of biofuel production, distribution, and consumption in an effort to inform policies that could reduce these costs. This dissertation contains seven research chapters that examine social costs of ethanol at different points along the supply chain. This work begins by examining some impacts of cellulosic feedstock production. Land use change, especially indirect land use change, has been the most controversial topic within the biofuel research community in recent years, with some findings indicating that biofuels could be more carbon‐intensive than gasoline. However, cost reductions from cellulosic ethanol could be used to more than offset the increased emissions if policies are in place to balance the impacts. Ethanol production from forest thinnings, on the other hand, could result in a positive externality by reducing wildfire damage while also providing funds for additional fuel treatments. Decisions regarding cellulosic ethanol facility size and location can have significant impacts on production cost. Cellulosic ethanol refinery investments over the next 12 years are expected to be on the order of $100 billion, so these decisions could be costly if made suboptimally. The rest of the thesis examines costs and impacts of ethanol distribution, promoting a regional fuel strategy that would have ethanol consumed in high‐level blends (such as E85) in regions where it can be produced (mainly the Midwest and Southeast) rather than in low‐level blends throughout the country. Regional distribution would save billions of dollars per year in shipping costs and reduce shipping loads and congestion costs along the rail freight network. Imports of sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil could be part of this regional fuel strategy, but costs for shipping the fuel from plants to ports within Brazil could be substantial. A key component of this regional fuel strategy is the penetration of both flex‐fuel vehicles and E85 infrastructure throughout ethanol producing regions, but these costs are generally less than the savings from reduced shipping costs. Next‐generation biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol will play an increasing role in meeting transportation energy demand in the near future. This research will hopefully help shape policies that will allow cellulosic ethanol to meet demand while limiting social cost.",8/1/10,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:23,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714815.v1,,"/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/FTJXVHKI/Kocoloski - 2010 - Approaches to Reducing the Social Cost of Biofuel Production, Distribution, and Consumption.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, this thesis presents a new method to generate long periods of non-stationary wind speed time series data sampled at high rates by combining measured and simulated data. Paper 1 calculates the cost of curtailing the power output of a wind farm to provide a reserve of power to regulate the electrical grid frequency, as required by grid operators in several countries with high wind-power penetrations. The simulations in Paper 1 show that it is most efficient to curtail a few turbines deeply rather than curtail all turbines in a wind farm equally. Compared to regulation prices in the Texas (ERCOT) market in 2007-2009, a curtailed wind farm would be cost-competitive with conventional generators less than 1% of the time. Paper 2 supports the simulations in Paper 1 by developing a method to combine long periods of low-frequency wind speed data with realistic simulated high-frequency turbulence. The combined time series of wind speeds retains the non-stationary characteristics of wind speed, such as diurnal variations, the passing of weather fronts, and seasonal variations, but gives a much higher sampling rate. Papers 3 and 4 estimate the hurricane risks to current designs of offshore wind turbines in the U.S. Paper 3 develops analytical probability distributions based on historical hurricane records to predict the distribution of damages to a single wind farm in a given location. Paper 4 uses simulated hurricanes with realistic statistical properties to estimate the correlated risks to all the wind farms in a region and estimate the distribution of aggregate losses over different periods. Both papers find hurricane risks are small for current turbine designs in New England and the Mid-Atlantic, but the risks in the Gulf of Mexico and the Southeast are significant enough to warrant new, stronger designs. Hurricane risks could be reduced almost an order of magnitude by ensuring that turbines can continue yawing to track the wind direction even if grid power is lost.",5/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:23,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714854.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/ZSUXRW3K/Rose - 2013 - Assessing the Costs and Risks of Novel Wind Turbine Applications.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study aims to analyze the process of natural resource exploitation, to optimize the extraction and utilization processes, maximizing their economic and social values while reducing the accompanied negative environmental impacts. This dissertation focuses on the impacts of exploitation of mineral and hydrocarbon resources in emerging countries on global warming effect, economy and society. Chapter 2 of the dissertation analyzes the life cycle GHG emissions associated with iron ore mining and processing in China. With rapid economic development and nationwide urbanization, the iron ore demand grows while the ore grade declines significantly, leading to the increasing GHG emissions from iron ore production. Results of the research show that the mean life-cycle GHG emissions for Chinese iron ore production are 270 kg CO2e/tonne, with a 90% confidence interval of 210 to 380 kg CO2e/tonne. The two largest contributors to overall GHG emissions are agglomeration (60%) and ore processing (23%). Iron content (ore grade) varies from 15% to 60% and is the largest contributor (40%) to the uncertainty of the results. Chapter 3 explores the impact of China’s outsourcing of iron resources on the global warming effect. This chapter applies the same life cycle assessment framework of Chinese iron ore in Chapter 2 to Australian and Brazilian ore production, and compares the LCA results of Australian and Brazilian ore to Chinese iron ore. Results show that among the three iron ore sources, Australian iron ore is the optimal choice for reducing GHG emissions. The mean life cycle GHG emissions of Australian iron ore fines is 60% less than that of Chinese iron ore fines (42 kg CO2e/tonne versus 110 kg CO2e/tonne). There is no significant difference between the imported iron ores sourced from Brazil versus the China’s domestic supplied iron ores, but if Chinese ore grade falls below 20% in the future, Brazilian iron ores would be preferred. The largest source of GHG emissions for Australian and Brazilian iron ores comes from ocean shipping (accounts for 58% and 75% of the overall GHG emissions respectively). Chapter 4 studies the impacts of the exploitation of pre-salt natural gas in Brazil. Natural gas production and its associated downstream industries are currently underdeveloped in Brazil, while the on-going exploitation of deep-sea pre-salt reservoir would potentially change the current situation. This study analyzes the impacts of the increasing pre-salt gas production and potential natural gas use pathways in downstream industries. Results reveal that GHG emissions associated with pre-salt gas production vary according to the stage of reservoir exploitation. At the early stage, the estimate of GHG emissions is 5.4 (90%CI: 4.5~6.4) gCO2e/MJ, and the value becomes 7.1 (90% CI: 6.3~8.0) gCO2e/MJ for the intermediate stage. All six natural gas use pathways analyzed in the study emit less GHG on average than their current corresponding incumbent pathways. The mean GHG emissions reduction from natural gas use for power generation, nitrogen fertilizer production, methanol production, as the reducing agent for steel making, ethylene-based polymer production, heavy-duty vehicle fueling are estimated to be 0.83, 2.3, 0.38, 35, 2.6 and 0.078 million tonnes CO2 equivalent per year, respectively. The specific economic profits of the six pathways are affected by the prices of natural gas and traditional fuel. Under current fuel prices, the net annual profits for the six pathways are -270, 87, 92, 1700, 190 and -1500 million dollars, respectively. The job creation potential from the pathways of power generation, nitrogen fertilizer production, methanol production and as reducing agent for steel production are estimated to be 28, 17, 5 and 36 thousand, respectively.",10/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:23,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714860.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/33Q3UYHI/Gan - 2017 - Assessing the Impacts of Mineral and Hydrocarbon Resources Exploitation and Consumption.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis models one of several early-stage post-combustion CO2 capture technologies, solid sorbent-based CO2 capture process, and presents performance and cost estimates of this system on pulverized coal power plants. The spreadsheet-based software package Microsoft Excel was used in conjunction with AspenPlus modelling results and the Integrated Environmental Control Model to develop performance and cost estimates for the solid sorbent-based CO2 capture technology. A reduced order model also was created to facilitate comparisons among multiple design scenarios. Assumptions about plant financing and utilization, as well as uncertainties in heat transfer and material design that affect heat exchanger and reactor design were found to produce a wide range of cost estimates for solid sorbent-based systems. With uncertainties included, costs for a supercritical power plant with solid sorbent-based CO2 capture ranged from $167 to $533 per megawatt hour for a first-of-a-kind installation (with all costs in constant 2011 US dollars) based on a 90% confidence interval. The median cost was $209/MWh. Post-combustion solid sorbent-based CO2 capture technology is then evaluated in terms of the potential cost for a mature system based on historic experience as technologies are improved with sequential iterations of the currently available system. The range costs for a supercritical power plant with solid sorbent-based CO2 capture was found to be $118 to $189 per megawatt hour with a nominal value of $163 per megawatt hour given the expected range of technological improvement in the capital and operating costs and efficiency of the power plant after 100 GW of cumulative worldwide experience. These results suggest that the solid sorbent-based system will not be competitive with currently available liquid amine-systems in the absence of significant new improvements in solid sorbent properties and process system design to reduce the heat exchange surface area in the regenerator and cross-flow heat exchanger. Finally, the importance of these estimates for policy makers is discussed.",11/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714866.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

U.S. corn ethanol production keeps increasing under federal mandates, and NG production soars due to successful tapping of unconventional resources in North America, particularly shale gas. Numerous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies document technology specific corn ethanol and NG GHG estimates. The estimates often include all life cycle stages from fuel supply to combustion, and point out potential for emissions reductions. Several studies suggest that using GHG emissions as an evaluation metric underestimates corn ethanol’s radiative forcing (RF) impact – a precursor and indicator for global temperature change – by 10-90% over the next few decades. This emissions timing effect may overestimate (i) ethanol’s climate benefits over gasoline and (ii) the effectiveness of U.S. policies mandating and subsidizing ethanol. This work revisits the above studies, and builds upon existing models to quantify RF impacts across the corn ethanol life cycle. The emissions timing factor (ETF) is significantly smaller than previous estimates (2-13% depending on the chosen impact time frame), and the effect is dwarfed by uncertainty in the GHG emissions estimates. Nevertheless, ETF reduces ethanol’s probability of meeting the federal target of 20% GHG reduction relative to gasoline from 53% (according to EPA GHG estimates) to 7-29%. However, the small potential climate impacts from U.S. ethanol use may not actually be observable based on estimated initial increases in global average surface temperature of < 0.001 °C. About 25% of global primary energy production comes from NG, whose life cycle GHG emissions and potential future climate impacts from substituting coal are highly uncertain due to fugitive methane (CH4) emissions from the NG industry. Accurately quantifying the NG fugitive emissions (FE) rate – the percentage of produced NG, mainly CH4 and ethane (C2H6) – released to the atmosphere is challenging due to the size and complexity of the NG industry. Recent LCA estimates suggest that the current NG FE rate could be as high as 8% and 6%, from shale and conventional NG, respectively, and other bottom-up studies indicate even higher rates several decades ago. This work analyzes possible ranges of the global average NG FE rate based on atmospheric CH4, C2H6, and carbon isotope (δ13C-CH4) measurements recorded since 1984, and top-down modeling of their sources and sinks. Box-model, δ13C-CH4mass balance, and 3D-modeling results agree on best estimate NG FE rates of 3-5% (of dry NG production and dry NG composition) globally over the past decade, and 5-8% around 1990. Upper bound FE rates are 5% and 7% in 2010 and 2000, respectively. Best estimate and upper bound values may be overestimated because both assume lower bound emissions from oil and coal production as well as complete absence of natural hydrocarbon seepage. While LCA studies are useful for identifying processes with the greatest NG FE reduction potential, the recent high bottom-up estimates do not appear representative of the U.S. national average based on top-down modeling results. Given the steadily declining NG FE rates one may expect that further emissions abatement is possible if industry practices are further improved.",12/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714875.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meeting this increased demand will require both technology innovations, but also new ways of thinking about the costs of implementing these technologies. This dissertation examines electrochemical energy storage technologies at multiple phases of the product cycle to assess how to meet some of the challenges associated with widespread adoption of electrochemical energy storage. Using a process-based cost model to identify the factors that contribute most to battery manufacturing cost, I find that economies of scale cost reductions have largely already been achieved. However, changes in cell design parameters can help to lower the per kWh cost of lithium-ion cells. Looking at a use case for energy storage in a hybrid microgrid, I find that both battery chemistry characteristics and technology costs impact the overall performance of hybrid microgrids and the cost of delivering electricity. As more batteries are produced to meet growing demand, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with battery manufacturing and waste disposal will become increasingly important. Using an attributional life cycle analysis, I compare the emissions associated with two different recycling processes: pyrometallurgical recycling and direct cathode recycling. While pyrometallurgical recycling does not offer emissions reductions, direct cathode recycling does have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, even if the cathode recovery process has relatively low yield rates. Using these recovered cathode materials is contingent on a market that will accept these recycled materials. A survey of current electric vehicle owners shows that consumer preferences about battery materials differ depending on whether consumers purchased a plug-in hybrid or an all electric vehicle. Overall, plug-in hybrid vehicle owners seem to have a slightly negative perception of recycled battery materials. For electric vehicle owners that have an all-electric vehicle, there are more diverse preferences, with groups that have positive, negative, and indifferent preferences about the type of battery material used in their vehicle. The heterogeneous preferences of different electric vehicle owners could enable different trends in material recovery and reuse as the number of electric vehicles on the road, and the battery energy storage used for transportation, increase.",3/1/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Battery Energy Storage for Maturing Markets,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714944.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the roles of learning and knowledge transfer in a multi-product production setting are not well understood. Production and operations management literature suggests production of a variety of products is largely harmful, yet the organizational learning literature suggests there may be benefits to heterogeneity. This work explores the significance of a multi-product environment on organizational learning and knowledge transfer by studying a US-owned overseas manufacturing facility that is a leading producer of high technology hardware components. The firm produces 5 generations of high-volume focus products as well as a collection of non-focus products [an assortment of small volume products related to the focus products]. We draw on 10 years of firm archival data and qualitative data collected to shed insights into how different levels of product mix (5 generations of a focus product, thousands of minor variations on products to meet customer specifications, and an assortment of small volume products related to the focus product) impact organizational learning differently and why knowledge transfers across some products and not others by examining the role that processes play in these product transitions. Our results reconcile differences between the organizational learning and production and operations management literatures by finding support for both advantages and disadvantages to product mix on the production line depending on the extent of product differences. We find that short-term productivity improves with bounded diversity – specifically, when multiple generations of the same product are produced in the same facility. This positive impact on productivity of having multiple generations of the same product on the line may in part be explained by the firm’s ability to successfully transfer knowledge from older to newer generations of the product, improving long-term productivity, though we find benefits for focus product heterogeneity over and above the benefits from knowledge transfer. In contrast, we find short-term productivity is decreased when the production line is faced with variety across products that are too different from each other (e.g. different form factors) and across minor product variations (i.e. customer-specific product variations).",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Benefits of Bounded Diversity,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714977.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I focus in the case of Portugal, where by 2006 the Portuguese government had completed a major initiative that upgraded the Internet connection of all public schools, replacing the previously existing connections by broadband. In the first study I focus on the direct effects the introduction of broadband in middle schools had in students' performance. I find that high levels of broadband use in schools are detrimental for 9th grade national exam scores. For the average broadband use in schools, exam scores reduce about 0.97 of a standard deviation from 2005 to 2009. I also find suggestive evidence that the way schools allow students to use the Internet affects students' performance. In particular, students in schools that block access to websites such as YouTube perform relatively better. In the second study, I look at spillover effects of providing broadband to schools in home Internet adoption. I assess the magnitude of these effects using household level data on home Internet penetration and Internet traffic in all schools in Portugal. I find that school broadband use contributes directly to a higher adoption rate in households with children. During 2008 and 2009 school Internet use increased the probability of adopting Internet by 20% in households with children, while no statistically significant effect was found in households without children. In the third study I focus on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills and on the dynamics of computer and Internet use inside the household. I provide empirical evidence that the presence of children or young adults in the household does contribute to an increase in the likelihood of having a computer or Internet at home, but does not contribute to an increase in use patterns and skills. Moreover, I find that the presence of children and young adults is associated with lower levels of computer and Internet use and skills.",8/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Broadband in Schools,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715037.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first method, balancing area consolidation, addresses this cost rise by reducing the demand for ancillary services. This research quantifies the economic benefit of consolidation in the frequency regulation market by estimating the resulting reductions in frequency regulation requirements and cost. The results show that this policy leads to a reduction in frequency regulation cost of approximately $0.1 per MWh of total load. These results do not significantly change with the inclusion of 20% wind, suggesting that in the near term, wind’s interaction in the frequency regulation market is not a prime motivation for consolidation. This analysis does not consider all the benefits or costs of BA consolidation, and is not meant as an assessment of net-benefits. Though the results show consolidation could lead to an increase in emissions of some air pollutants, which suggest that there may be significant trade-offs associated with the decision to consolidate balancing areas. The second means of addressing the expected increase in ancillary services costs is to increase the supply of ancillary services by leveraging residential demand response. We developed methods that optimally schedule ancillary service capacity on demand response resources while accounting for the risk of customer response fatigue. The model is used to test the efficacy of hourly caps on demand response penetration in ancillary service markets. The results show that residential demand response could provide a significant portion of the total ancillary service requirements attributable to residential loads: between 50% and 75%. Hourly caps on demand response participation are shown to be economically inefficient. With a 25% market cap, residential demand response is scheduled to 6 provide 25% of the hourly total market value, while the risked-based optimization schedules residential demand response to provide 82% of the total value. Methods like the ones presented in this paper, that can appropriately weight the benefits and risks of committing residential demand response will be critical to efficiently and effectively use this resource for ancillary services.",4/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715058.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concerns that mitigation may be too slow in coming have lead to renewed dialogue within the scientific community regarding potential strategies for counteracting global warming through geoengineering, defined as “the deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth’s climate system, in order to moderate global warming.” (Shepherd et al., 2009) The geoengineering schemes that are considered most feasible today involve planetary albedo modification, or “solar radiation management” (SRM). This thesis addresses several outstanding questions regarding uncertainty in global and regional effects of SRM activities. The technical components of this work are centered on two modeling experiments which use a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) implemented through climateprediction.net. Drawing upon knowledge gained through these experiments and interaction with the broader research community, I explore the international relations implications of SRM and the global governance issues associated with it. The first experiment explored regional differences in climate modified by SRM using a large-ensemble modeling experiment that examines the effects of 54 global temperature stabilization scenarios. Our results confirm other research that shows a world with SRM would generally have less extreme temperature and precipitation anomalies than one with unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions and no SRM, but illustrate the physical unfeasibility of simultaneously stabilizing global precipitation and temperature as long as greenhouse gases continue to rise. Over time, simulated temperature and precipitation in large regions such as China and India vary significantly with different SRM trajectories and diverge from historic baselines in different ways. Hence the use of SRM to stabilize climate in all regions simultaneously may not be possible. Regional diversity in the response to different levels of SRM could complicate what is already a very challenging problem of global governance, and could make consensus about the “optimal” level of geo-engineering difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. The second experiment modeled SRM using a perturbed physics ensemble with a wide range of temperature responses and climate sensitivities, all of which are consistent with observed recent warming. The analysis shows that the efficacy and distribution of effects of SRM varies with the temperature response of the model. Models that produce more global warming are also generally more sensitive to SRM, so the amount of modification of the Earth’s energy balance needed to meet any given climate stabilization criteria appear to be relatively insensitive to climate sensitivity. While in the more sensitive models, SRM is generally less successful in returning regional climates to their unperturbed states the longer it is used to compensate for rising greenhouse gases, it is also where SRM is most effective relative to a no SRM alternative. SRM does not prevent further acidification of the oceans and this fact, coupled with the fact that SRM can only slow, never halt, changes to regional climate states, makes SRM untenable as a long-term solution to the problems caused by rising GHGs in the atmosphere. Much more research on SRM is needed before any conclusions on whether or not to deploy it are reached, but this work suggests that regional inequities in climate response are probably not the main impediment to its effective implementation. While SRM can never perfectly correct for regional climate change, these experiments suggest that it generally reduces (rather than exacerbates) changes to regional temperature and precipitation and greatly reduces the rate of temperature change. Considering the slow progress society has made towards reducing emissions, however, it is important to consider the potential benefits SRM technologies may confer in reducing impacts to buy time for both mitigation and adaptation.",8/1/11,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715088.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to move toward evidence-based policymaking, this thesis develops computational models to assess the tradeoffs associated with alternatives for both RET achievement and RET policy formulation, including the option of creating renewable energy credit (REC) markets to facilitate meeting an RET goal. A mixed integer linear program (MILP), a probabilistic cost prediction model and a mixed complementarity problem (MCP) serve as the theoretical bases for the RET alternative and policy formulation analyses. From these models it was found, inter alia, that RET goals set too low run the risk of creating technological lock-in and could inhibit achievement of higher goals; probabilistic cost predictions give decision-makers essential risk information, when cost estimation is an integral part of alternatives assessment; and though REC markets may facilitate RET achievement, including REC markets in an RET policy formulation may not result in the lowest possible greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).",5/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715268.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The thesis is broadly in two sections: a simulation section, which focuses on government stakeholders, and a large-scale data analysis section, which focuses on the public and domestic actor stakeholders. In the simulation section, it demonstrates that the nonproliferation norm is an emergent behavior from political alliance and hostility networks, and that alliances play a role in current day nuclear proliferation. This model is robust and contains second-order effects of extended hostility and alliance relations. In the large-scale data analysis section, the thesis demonstrates the role that context plays in sentiment evaluation and highlights how Twitter collection can provide useful input to policy processes.

To meet the needs of thoseusers, it is important to expand capacity of networks that provide Internet access in cost effectiveways. This capacity has traditionally been provided by cellular networks. However,expanding the capacity of those networks alone may not be the most cost-effective way to meetthe present and future growth of mobile Internet under some circumstances. In this dissertation,we show that networks of connected vehicles can be an important way to complement thecapacity of cellular networks to provide mobile Internet access under several scenarios.Connected vehicles may soon be widely deployed, forming mesh networks of short-rangeconnections among vehicles and between vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Theseconnections are collectively referred to as vehicle-to-everything, or V2X. Deployment ofconnected vehicles and infrastructure is primarily intended to enhance road safety, and the U.S.Department of Transportation has recently proposed a mandate of V2X devices in vehiclesusing Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) technology. Other applications are alsoenvisioned that include Internet access in vehicles connecting to roadside infrastructure servingas gateways to the Internet.In this work, we find that V2X-based networks are more cost-effective than cellular toprovide Internet access, in scenarios which DSRC devices are mandated in vehicles to enhanceroad safety. This is true initially for densely populated urban areas, but over time V2X-basednetworks would be cost-effective in less populated areas as well, as long as Internet traffic orpenetration of V2X devices grow as expected.Local and state governments are expected to deploy roadside infrastructure for safetyapplications. If that infrastructure is shared with Internet Service Providers for a fee, then V2XABSTRACT based networks are cost-effective in locations with even lower population densities than thelocations where it is cost-effective to deploy infrastructure for Internet access only. Moreover,the sharing fee could help governments save in infrastructure costs. We find the pricingstrategies that maximize either cost-effectiveness or government savings. We estimate thatgovernments could save about one-fifth of the total cost to deploy safety infrastructurenationwide in the U.S., if fees are set to maximize government savings. Although we find thatthese prices may differ from the pricing strategy that maximizes cost-effectiveness, maximizinggovernment savings results in near-optimal cost-effectiveness.The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has allocated 75 MHz of spectrum to beused exclusively by DSRC devices, and it has been hotly debated whether all or part of thatbandwidth should be shared with unlicensed devices. We find that it is highly efficient to shareany spectrum allocated to V2X communications beyond the portion of that spectrum that isneeded for safety-critical DSRC messages. V2X and unlicensed devices require up to 50% lessbandwidth on shared spectrum to achieve given throughputs, compared to V2X and unlicenseddevices using separate bands. We conclude that the spectrum available for V2X should bemaintained or increased, as long as much of that spectrum is shared with non-V2X devices.Conclusions are derived from an engineering-economic approach, in which part of theassumptions are based on data from a citywide deployment of connected vehicles in Portugal.The data is used in a detailed and realistic packet-level simulation model of V2X-basednetworks used to provide Internet access with DSRC technology. In some scenarios, thesimulation also includes unlicensed devices using Wi-Fi technology.

Use of P2P and transfers of copyrighted content were widespread on campus. In Spring 2008, 40% of students living on campus were detected using a P2P protocol, 70% of which were observed attempting to transfer copyrighted material. In late 2010, we estimate that over 800 million copies of content were transferred globally using BitTorrent per day, with an estimated number of transferred songs 13.1 times greater than worldwide sales of songs, and estimated number of transferred movies 6.8 times greater than worldwide box-office sales and 16.4 times greater than U.S. DVD and Blu-ray sales. Most transfers were from a small number of very popular titles that were widely available for sale. We found no evidence that use of P2P to transfer content without violating copyright was common both on campus and global BitTorrent. This indicates that copyright law is violated frequently using P2P, and while we cannot quantify how P2P transfers translate to lost sales, it is reasonable to assume some sales are lost due to P2P. Focusing on effectiveness of DPI, after a couple weeks of monitoring DPI found up to 80% of detected P2P users attempting to transfer copyrighted content. In the short term, DPI could be effective to assess which network users transfer copyrighted content using P2P given some weeks of monitoring. However, limitations such as not being able to detect users of encrypted P2P can reduce DPIʼs effectiveness in the long term. Using behavioral classifiers that we implemented and that can detect encrypted BitTorrent from traffic summaries, we found students shifting from unencrypted to encrypted BitTorrent in the 2007-2008 academic year. If this trend continues, effectiveness of DPI for enforcement can be significantly hindered",8/1/11,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Copyright Violation on the Internet,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715397.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The costs and benefits of low carbon technology options are unique and affect different market participants in different ways. In this thesis, we examine the cost effectiveness of carbon mitigation technologies and policies from the social perspective and from the perspective of consumers. In Chapter 2, we perform an engineering-economic analysis of hybridizing concentrating solar thermal power with fossil fuel. We examine the cost effectiveness of substituting the solar power for new coal or gas and find the cost of mitigation to be approximately ~$130/tCO2 to ~$300/tCO2. In Chapter 3, we quantify some externalized social costs and benefits of wind energy. We estimate the costs due to variability and transmission unique to wind to have an expected value of ~$20/MWh. In Chapter 4, we quantify the cost effectiveness of a renewable portfolio standard and a carbon price from the perspective of consumers in restructured markets. We find that both that the RPS can be more cost effective than a carbon price for consumers under certain circumstances: continued excess supply of capacity, retention of nuclear generators, and high natural gas prices. In Chapter 5, we examine the implications of lowering electricity sector CO2 emissions in PJM through a Low Carbon Capacity Standard (LCCS). We estimate that an LCCS would supply the same amount of energy (105,000 GWh) as the RPS’s in PJM and an additional ~10 GW of capacity. We find that the LCCS could be more cost effective for consumers than an RPS if it lowered capacity prices.",9/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715433.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CQQITJMC,thesis,2016,"Quintana, Frankie Catota",Cybersecurity Capabilities in a Critical Infrastructure Sector of a Developing Nation,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Cybersecurity_Capabilities_in_a_Critical_Infrastructure_Sector_of_a_Developing_Nation/6715514/1,"When information technology is incorporated into the operations of financial critical infrastructure, it brings with it a range of cyber risks, and mitigating them requires that firms and regulators develop capabilities to foster protection. The sophistication of cyber threats to the financial sector has been growing rapidly. Developed nations have worked hard to improve their knowledge of these threats and establish strategies to respond accordingly. However, in developing nations, both the understanding of the risks posed by cyber threats and the ability to address those risks have been slower to evolve. Developing the needed cybersecurity capabilities in developing countries encounter challenges that need to be identified and addressed. In order to begin to do that, this thesis reports on three studies conducted in the context of Ecuador. The first study identifies and assesses incident experiences, challenges, barriers, and desired actions reported by financial security managers with the objective of identifying strategies to enhance incident response capabilities. The second study begins with the security incidents reported by the Ecuadorian financial stakeholders during the first study and assesses the potential effectiveness of the government policy that is intended to address IT risk in the financial sector. The third study explores the challenges that universities face in order to provide cybersecurity instruction to protect critical infrastructure and explores potential strategies to advance cybersecurity education at the university level. In support of this work we collected data from national practitioners involved in responding to security incidents and in developing cybersecurity skills. Sixty-one in-depth, semi-structured interviews across five cities were conducted (95% in person, the rest by telephone) with respondents who had good knowledge in the subjects. Respondents come mainly from: the financial sector (CISOs, risk and IT managers, security chiefs, security officers, authorities); telecommunications sector, especially ISPs (managers, directors, engineers, authorities); and academia (deans, directors, professors). We transcribed all the interviews, coded them and conducted qualitative text analysis. This research finds that (1) the financial sector is already facing risks driven by outsiders and insiders that lead to fraud and operational errors and failures. The main barriers to improving protection are small team size, network visibility, inadequate internal coordination, technology updating, lack of training, and lack of awareness. The sector has little community support to respond to incidents, and the national legal framework has not supported appropriate prosecution of cyber criminals; (2) the national IT risk management policy has reasonably covered most countermeasures related to reported security incidents. There are however, several areas of gap, one of the most important is network security, which can enable sophisticated malware attacks; (3) today the level of cybersecurity education is mostly elementary in Ecuador. Academic interviewees at only four of the thirteen universities studied expressed confidence that they can provide students with reasonable preparation. Ecuador needs to design a national cybersecurity plan that prioritizes protection for critical infrastructure and should support strategies that allow the country to enhance cybersecurity capabilities. Properly designed these initiatives should allow the nation to develop a core structure to confront current and emergent cyber challenges in the financial sector and other critical national operations, and build the human resources necessary to continue that effort.",12/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715514.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BVUENRT2,thesis,2010,"Tagert, Adam C.",Cybersecurity Challenges in Developing Nations,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Cybersecurity_Challenges_in_Developing_Nations/6715520/1,"This thesis examines the guidance that is being given to developing nations that are rapidly deploying information and communication technologies. It studied the African countries of Rwanda and Tunisia to draw lessons of the situation and potential methods of improving the situation. The thesis found that developing nations are often recommended to implement a conglomeration of existing rules and regulations found in other countries especially in European countries and in the United States. Developing countries are also recommended to create national CERTs, organizations of cybersecurity experts to coordinate a nation to respond to cyber incidents. The proposed rules and regulations are largely irrelevant for developing nations and the proposed missions of a CERT do not match the needs of those countries. In promoting better guidance, the thesis identifies and discusses several challenges. It finds policy makers in developing nations are aware of the cyber threat, and that the cyber threat is different and often smaller in less ICT developed nations even if they are using similar equipment and software. To help craft better recommendations, the thesis identifies the benefits of ICT especially in agriculture, education and government. These benefits are analyzed to determine whether they would be protected by current guidance and the analysis determines that protecting ICT use in government should be the priority. In crafting future guidance the challenges are that nations have differences in ICT architecture and ICT use, and developing nations have fewer resources but also they have different resources to use. Another such difference is the common lack of a private cybersecurity sector and different expectations of government. This thesis concludes with discussing unexpected results. The first is Rwandan policy makers desire good enough security and have a higher risk tolerance concerning cyber threats than is found in more developed nations. In addition, open source software can be a potential way to reduce the cost of cyberspace defense and this thesis makes an initial investigation. The lesson of the thesis is that cybersecurity strategy is not a one size fits all and so it must be customized for each country.",12/1/10,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715520.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This spending is highly sensitive to uncontrollable and poorly understood market forces. Additionally, while some stakeholders may not prioritize its monetary cost and risk, energy is fundamentally coupled to other critical factors. Energy, operational capability, and logistics are heavily intertwined and dependent on uncertain security environment and technology futures. These components and their relationships are less understood. Without better characterization, future capabilities may be significantly limited by present-day acquisition decisions. One attempt to demonstrate these costs and risks to decision makers has been through a metric known as the Fully Burdened Cost of Energy (FBCE). FBCE is defined as the commodity price for fuel plus many of these hidden costs. The metric encouraged a valuable conversation and is still required by law. However, most FBCE development stopped before the lessons from that conversation were incorporated. Current implementation is easy to employ but creates little value. Properly characterizing the costs and risks of energy and putting them in a useful tradespace requires a new framework. This research aims to highlight energy’s complex role in many aspects of military operations, the critical need to incorporate it in decisions, and a novel framework to do so. It is broken into five parts. The first describes the motivation behind FBCE, the limits of current implementation, and outlines a new framework that aids decisions. Respectively, the second, third, and fourth present a historic analysis of the connections between military capabilities and energy, analyze the recent evolution of this conversation within the DoD, and pull the historic analysis into a revised framework. The final part quantifies the potential impacts of deeply uncertain futures and technological development and introduces an expanded framework that brings capability, energy, and their uncertainty into the same tradespace. The work presented is intended to inform better policies and investment decisions for military acquisitions. The discussion highlights areas within the DoD’s understanding of energy that could improve or whose development has faltered.

Technical decision aid can provide a framework for informed decision making, allowing individuals to better understand the tradeoff between resources, technology, energy services, and prices. While technical decision aid have made significant advances in evaluating these quantitative aspects of energy planning and performance, they have not been designed to incorporate human factors, such as preferences and behavior that are informed by cultural values. Incorporating cultural values into decision tools can provide not only an improved decision framework for the Navajo Nation, but also generate new insights on how these perspective can improve decision making on energy resources. Ensuring these aids are a cultural fit for each context has the potential to increase trust and promote understanding of the tradeoffs involved in energy resource management. In this dissertation I present the development of a technical tool that explicitly addresses cultural and spiritual values and experimentally assesses their influence on the preferences and decision making of Navajo citizens. Chapter 2 describes the results of a public elicitation effort to gather information about stakeholder views and concerns related to energy development in the Navajo Nation in order to develop a larger sample survey and a decision-support tool that links techno-economic energy models with sociocultural attributes.

This tool also provides an alternative to economic valuation of cultural impacts based upon an ordinal index tied to environmental impacts.

Assessments of carbon sequestration resources that have been made for North America using existing methodologies likely underestimate uncertainty and variability in the reservoir parameters. This thesis describes a geostatistical model developed to estimate the CO2 storage resource in sedimentary formations. The proposed stochastic model accounts for the spatial distribution of reservoir properties and is implemented to a case study of the Oriskany Formation of the Appalachian sedimentary basin. The developed model allows for estimation of the CO2 sequestration resource of a storage formation with subsequent uncertainty analysis. Since the model is flexible with respect to changing input parameters and assumptions it can be parameterized to calculate the CO2 storage resource of any porous subsurface unit. The thesis continues with evaluation of the cost of CO2 injection and storage for the Oriskany Formation utilizing storage resource estimates generated by our geostatistical model. Our results indicate that the cost of sequestering CO2 has significant spatial variation due to heterogeneity of formation properties and site geology. We identify the low-cost areas within the Oriskany footprint. In general, these areas correspond to the deepest portions of the Appalachian basin and could be considered as potential CO2 injection sites for CCS industrial scale projects. Overall, we conclude that significant improvement can be made by integrating basin geology and spatial heterogeneity of formation petrophysical properties into CCS cost assessments, and that should be a focus of future research efforts. This will allow for more accurate cost estimates for the entire CCS system and identify areas of sedimentary basins with optimal conditions for CO2 injection and storage. To mitigate the effects of climate change, the U.S. will need a widespread deployment of low-carbon electricity generating technologies including natural gas and coal with CCS. More precise CO2 storage resource and CCS cost estimates will provide better recommendations for government and industry leaders and inform their decisions on what greenhouse gas mitigation measures are the best fit for their regions.",2/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715919.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to identifying applications and developing the methods for incorporating these data in engineering and economic analyses, the nontechnical aspects of these issues are also considered as implementation of these solutions depends on more than their technical feasibility. The first study frames the existing methods being used today to build a device-level accounting of where energy is used in the residential sector in the US. Three methods are identified and categorized: direct metering methods, non-intrusive load monitoring, and statistical methods. Two of the most prominent studies are compared, and a method is proposed by which the Department of Energy (DOE) and others could easily and cost-effectively incorporate existing submetered data into their estimates of device-level energy consumption in the US. In the second study, energy audit and survey records are used to model 106 homes in the DOE’s EnergyPlus building simulation software. Simulation results are compared to submetered data from the audited homes to provide a device-level measure of the accuracy of EnergyPlus models in a large sample of homes. Results show the models do not accurately or consistently estimate occupied home energy use due to factors such as occupant behaviors and appliance stocks which are not well-captured in traditional audit reports. These results provide context for the growing use of EnergyPlus models for homes, and highlight that care is needed to ensure that decision-makers are aware of its limitations. The third study uses device-level data to assess the technical and economic feasibility of distributing direct current (DC) power in homes with solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays. Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate the costs and benefits of this intervention while accounting for uncertainty in the engineering, economic, and other parameters. Results show significant energy savings potential, but at present DC equipment prices these savings are not cost-effective. In addition to quantifying energy and cost savings, a number of major nontechnical barriers to implementing DC distribution in homes are identified. In the final study, an expert elicitation is conducted with 17 experts on DC systems to better understand these barriers. Results show that the two biggest barriers to adoption are industry professionals unfamiliar with DC and small markets for DC devices and components. To address these, experts proposed developing training programs for engineers and electricians, and developing pilot projects to prove the benefits of DC in niche applications where DC power distribution holds a clear advantage over alternating current (AC). Experts also identified lasting and inherent benefits of DC that make these systems better suited to serve future building loads.",5/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715931.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Decision Analytic Perspective,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Does_Tropical_Cyclone_Modification_Make_Sense_A_Decision_Analytic_Perspective/6716105/1,"Recent dramatic increases in damages caused by tropical cyclones (TCs) and improved understanding of TC physics have led the Department of Homeland Security to fund research on intentional hurricane modification. Here I present a decision analytic assessment of whether hurricane modification is potentially cost effective in South Florida. First, for a single storm I compare hardening buildings to lowering the wind speed of a TC by reducing sea surface temperatures with wind-wave pumps. I find that if it were feasible and properly implemented, modification could reduce net wind losses from an intense storm more than hardening structures. However, hardening provides ""fail safe"" protection for average storms that might not be achieved if the only option were modification. The effect of natural variability is larger than that of either strategy. Second, for multiple storms over a given return period, I investigate TC wind and storm surge damage reduction by hardening buildings and by wind-wave pumps. The coastal areas examined experience more surge damages for short return periods, and more wind damages for long periods. Surge damages are best reduced through a surge barrier. Wind damages are best reduced by a portfolio of techniques including wind-wave pumps, assuming they work and are correctly deployed. Damages in areas outside of the floodplain will likely be dominated by wind damages, and hence a similar portfolio will likely be best in these areas. Since hurricane modification might become a feasible strategy for reducing hurricane damages, to facilitate an informed and constructive discourse on implementation, policy makers need to understand how people perceive hurricane modification. Therefore using the mental models approach, I identified Florida residents’ perceptions of hurricane modification techniques. First, hurricane modification was perceived as a relatively ineffective strategy for damage reduction. Second, hurricane modification was expected to lead to changes in path, but not necessarily strength. Third, reported anger at hurricane modification was weaker when path was unaltered and the damages equal to or less than projected. Fourth, individuals who recognized the uncertainty inherent in hurricane prediction reported more anger at scientists across modification scenarios.",12/1/11,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Does Tropical Cyclone Modification Make Sense?,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716105.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These chapters explore how adding flexibility to power plants equipped with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) affects system costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, how grid-scale electricity storage affects system CO2 emissions as a power system decarbonizes, and how distributed solar photovoltaic (distributed PV) electricity generation suppresses wholesale electricity prices. In each chapter, I address these questions through a combination of power system optimization, statistics, and techno-economic analysis, and tie my findings to policy implications. In Chapter 2, I compare the cost-effectiveness of “flexible” CCS retrofits to other compliance strategies with the U.S. Clean Power Plan (CPP) and a hypothetical stronger CPP. Relative to “normal” CCS, “flexible” CCS retrofits include solvent storage that allows the generator to temporarily eliminate the CCS parasitic load and increase the generator’s net efficiency, capacity, and ramp rate. Using a unit commitment and economic dispatch (UCED) model, I find that flexible CCS achieves more cost-effective emissions reductions than normal CCS under the CPP and stronger CPP, but that flexible CCS is less cost-effective than other compliance strategies under both reduction targets. In Chapter 3, I conduct a detailed comparison of how flexible versus normal CCS retrofits affect total system costs and CO2 emissions under a moderate and strong CO2 emission limit. Given that a key benefit of flexible CCS relative to normal CCS is increased reserve provision, I break total system costs into generation, reserve, and CCS capital costs. Using a UCED model, I find that flexible CCS retrofits reduce total system costs relative to normal CCS retrofits under both emission limits. Furthermore, 40-80% of these cost reductions come from reserve cost reductions. Accounting for costs and CO2 emissions, though, flexible CCS poses a trade-off to policymakers under the moderate emission limit, as flexible CCS increases system CO2 emissions relative to normal CCS. No such trade-off exists under the stronger emission limit, as flexible CCS reduces system CO2 emissions and costs relative to normal CCS. In Chapter 4, I quantify how storage affects operational CO2 emissions as a power system decarbonizes under a moderate and strong CO2 emission limit through 2045. In so doing, I aim to better understand how storage transitions from increasing CO2 emissions in historic U.S. systems to enabling deeply decarbonized systems. Additionally, under each target I compare how storage affects CO2 emissions when participating in only energy, only reserve, and energy and reserve markets. Using a capacity expansion (CE) model to forecast fleet changes through 2045 and a UCED model to quantify how storage affects system CO2 emissions, I find that storage quickly transitions from increasing to decreasing CO2 emissions under the moderate and strong emission limits. Whether storage provides only energy, only reserves, or energy and reserves drives large differences in the magnitude, but not the direction, of the effect of storage on CO2 emissions. In Chapter 5, I quantify a benefit of distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation often overlooked by value of solar studies, namely the market price response. By displacing high-cost marginal generators, distributed PV generation reduces wholesale electricity prices, which in turn reduces utilities’ energy procurement costs. Using 2013 through 2015 data from California including a database of all distributed PV systems in the three California investor owned utilities, we estimate historic hourly distributed PV generation in California, then link that generation to reduced wholesale electricity prices via linear regression. From 2013 through 2015, we find that distributed PV suppressed historic median hourly LMPs by up to $2.7-3.1/MWh, yielding avoided costs of up to $650-730 million. These avoided costs are smaller than but on the order of other avoided costs commonly included in value of solar studies, so merit inclusion in future studies to properly value distributed PV.",12/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716132.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation shows how economic and social welfare analysis can be used to inform the design of a CCN architecture that provides network stakeholders with incentives to deploy and use. Firstly, the dissertation investigates the economic incentives of different stakeholders to deploy content-centric network Internet architectures and shows that network operators will fail to deploy sufficient storage infrastructure to support CCN without payment ows from publishers. However, the level of payment required differs for different network players, which gives them different competitive advantages in providing storage infrastructure and content delivery services. Secondly, it evaluates the social welfare implications of different storage deployment scenarios in a CCN-based architecture and identifies two deployments that maximize social welfare. In the first, edge networks provide the storage infrastructure through a transaction broker. In the second, edge networks pay third-parties an amount, equivalent to the realized benefits from a storage node, to deploy storage infrastructure in the network. All other deployment scenarios lead to a deadweight loss. Thirdly, the dissertation identifies content delivery functionalities that break in a CCN-based architecture and shows how these functionalities can be successfully replicated and enhanced by a careful design of the structure of routable content, content naming and the meta-information added to content. The proposed design supports several content delivery applications and can be easily extended to other networking principals. Finally, the dissertation identifies and discusses threats in the CCN content delivery model and proposes some mechanisms to address these threats. In addition, the dissertation identifies some policy implications of the CCN content delivery model and proposes some policy interventions that may lead to desirable deployment outcomes.",5/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Economic Incentives in Content-Centric Networking,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716135.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I calculate the break-even electricity prices and installation costs and find that, at a state level, solar PV is only currently economically attractive in Hawaii without the use of subsidies. In order for widespread adoption of solar PV, I illustrate how the availability of favorable financing terms, installation costs at or below $1.5/W, and the continuance of net energy metering policies are each critical. In Chapter 3, I create a case study to better understand solar PV economics for commercial and industrial customers, who collectively account for the majority of annual electricity sales in the United States. While residential customers are billed based on the total amount of energy they consume, commercial and industrial customers are also billed according to their greatest 15- minute energy use in a month with a demand charge. I analyze the net present value of a solar PV investment using both simulated and measured load and solar data for a variety of commercial customers in North and South Carolina. I identify key factors that influence economic viability and find that solar PV is not presently economically viable for these customers without subsidies, but will be once installation costs drop to below $1.25/W. In Chapter 4, I evaluate the economics of using energy storage to further reduce demand charges for each of the customers examined in Chapter 3. Using a “black-box” approach, I apply several generic energy storage technical attributes of a high-energy lithium-ion battery to assess the ideal performance and maximum economic benefit of energy storage. I find that batteries with lower capacities are most profitable for the commercial and industrial customers examined using an optimistic algorithm, but require further cost reductions using a pessimistic algorithm.",8/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716141.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Internships are intended to nurture the skills and make students better professionals, better innovators, and more likely to get employment. In this thesis I evaluated these claims by examining the effect of the skills developed by internships on the professional performance, innovation capability and employability of Mexican students. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate both the mandatory internship program in its ability to improve employability and to test some of the educational theories of workforce improvement and of what skills contribute to workers’ innovation capacity. Internships prepare students for the workplace by giving them opportunities to develop relevant skills. The Committee on the Assessment of 21st Century Skills of the U.S. National Research Council (NRC), identified three categories of workplace skills enabling individuals to face 21st Century challenges: cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal skills. I tested the relevance of these skills to interns’ professional performance using intern evaluation data on interns working at a multinational enterprise in the global steel industry, Ternium Mexico. A general model of internship outcomes was used to predict Main task and learning performance internship outcomes, and ordered logistic regression was used to predict Overall internship performance. The results confirmed that (1) cognitive intelligence or technical skills are necessary but not sufficient for success in executing professional tasks and (2) certain interpersonal and intrapersonal skills were also significantly associated with better professional performance as an intern. vi The ability to innovate is one of the most important and desired meta-skills for individuals, firms, and economies. It is believed that nurturing students’ innovation capability will improve their employability and their ability to deal with a rapidly changing future. A recent conceptual model of Individuals’ Innovation Capability, the D4 innovation model, has four stages: defining, discovering, developing, and demonstrating. Using the same internship evaluation data set, I determined whether the four D innovation skills: defining, discovering, developing and deploying skills, predicted Individuals’ Innovation Capability. The study confirmed that three of the innovation skills, discovery, developing and deploying, increase Individuals’ Innovation Capability. The foundation skills of oral communication and ability to self-update, and the professional competencies of establishing priorities and explicit knowledge also foster individual innovation capability. Internships have often been required for graduation by institutions of higher education because internships are perceived to help students increase their employability as well as provide educational value. I conducted statistical analyses to test whether students’ performance as interns and the number of internships they completed are predictive of their Probability of Employment, controlling for various labor-market conditions. The study analyzed the records of graduates at a private Mexican university who had completed undergraduate degrees as well as mandatory internships. A logistic regression model for job placement four months following graduation included: individual factors, personal circumstances, external conditions, and interactions with external conditions. This study revealed that the performance as an intern played an important role on employment and that employability depended on the interaction of a vii graduate’s personal assets, his/her family connections, and whether or not the labor market was contracting. This thesis is an empirical exploration of educational theory concerning the value of internships and also the skills that internships should foster. Since educational policy is frequently driven by theory, such validation is a potentially useful reality-check for policy makers. This work can inform educational policy and provide the underpinnings for shaping initiatives that benefit students, firms and the region.",8/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716153.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this thesis, I investigate the impact of electric vehicles based on this interaction in order to determine the possible benefits of controlling electric vehicle charging and how they compare to other vehicle options based on optimization models of electricity systems. I estimate the cost reductions from controlled charging of electric vehicles in the New York power system both with and without a high wind penetration and with and without the need for capacity expansion. In this power system, controlled charging can reduce the generation costs associated with charging the vehicles in half, with slightly higher cost reductions in high wind scenarios. I also estimate the cost reductions along with the changes in carbon and criteria air pollutant emissions due to controlled charging in the PJM power system. I examine both current and future grid scenarios, several plug-in vehicles types, and a high wind penetration scenario. Again I find that controlled charging can significantly reduce the costs of charging the vehicles, on the order of 30% of the generation costs to meet the charging demand. However, the environmental and health damages from the emissions cause total social costs to be higher with controlled charging in most cases. Finally, using the charging emissions from PJM, I evaluate the lifecycle emissions of plug-in, hybrid, and conventional vehicles in this region to determine which has lower environmental and health damages. I find that given the representative vehicles studied, plug-in electric vehicles have higher lifecycle damages than hybrids in PJM in 2010 but have lower lifecycle damages in a forecasted 2018 PJM power system.",2/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Electric Vehicles and the Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716195.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the characteristics of renewable energy resources differ greatly from conventional energy resources. Integrating large quantities of renewable resources therefore warrants enhancements and modifications to current practices as the current Indian power system lacks sufficient operational services that protect the grid against contingencies. This dissertation aims to analyze the operational and flexibility needs of the Indian grid to accommodate diverse and new energy sources. The first part of the dissertation analyzes the operational issues in the current power system. The Indian power system is restricted to a few services to support grid operation, which is primarily balancing demand and supply, in real-time. The different enhancements to the current balancing mechanism have varying impacts on the demand and supply balance, and this is reflected in the grid frequency. Therefore, the grid frequency under different balancing mechanism is modeled to understand the impacts. The results indicate that improving primary frequency response from generators along with a revision of the current prices is the most effective strategy. Next, given the current conditions that exist in the grid, a feasible load balancing mechanism is analyzed to understand the related benefits and costs. While the first part of the dissertation analyzes grid level impacts of different balancing mechanisms, the second part explores a service that should be implemented by the electric system operator to support grid balancing. The results indicate that the proposed mechanism is beneficial in reducing real-time emergency events by 55% at a power purchase cost increase of 3.5%. In addition to services, the system operators and regulators must ensure that there are sufficient flexible resources that can support the variability and uncertainty in the grid. The third part of the dissertation analyzes the impact of different generation scenarios on power system operation and reliability. The section highlights the need for flexible resources to counter the uncertainty and variability of renewable energy resources. In essence, the dissertation aims to encourage a rigorous approach to planning and policy making with regards to renewable energy integration.",5/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Enabling the Future Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716231.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AFFHIILR,thesis,2012,"Thomas, Brinda Ann",Energy Efficiency and Rebound Effects in the United States: Implications for Renewables Investment and Emissions Abatement,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Energy_Efficiency_and_Rebound_Effects_in_the_United_States_Implications_for_Renewables_Investment_and_Emissions_Abatement/6716243/1,"By lowering the energy required to provide a service, energy efficiency can help society consume less energy, emit less CO2e and other air pollutants, while maintaining quality of life. In this work, I examine a key benefit of energy efficiency, reducing renewables investment costs, and a side-effect, expanding energy service demand, also known as the rebound effect. First, I assess the economics of an energy efficiency intervention, using dedicated direct current (DC) circuits to operate lighting in commercial buildings. I find that using DC circuits in grid-connected PV-powered LED lighting systems can lower the total unsubsidized capital costs by 4% to 21% and levelized annual costs by 2% to 21% compared to AC grid-connected PV LEDs providing the same level of lighting service. I also explore the barriers and limitations of DC circuits in commercial buildings. Second, I examine the rebound effect from residential energy efficiency investments through a model in which households re-spend energy expenditure savings from an efficiency investment on more of the energy service (direct rebound) or on other goods and services (indirect rebound). Using U.S. household expenditure data and environmentally-extended input-output analysis, I find indirect rebound effects in CO2e emissions of 5-15%, depending on the fuel saved and assuming a 10% direct rebound. Third, I examine the variation in the indirect rebound from electricity efficiency across U.S. states due to differences in electric grid mix, fuel prices, household income, and spending patterns. I find that the CO2e direct and indirect rebound effects vary across states between 6-40%, when including full supply chain emissions, and between 4-30% when including only combustion and electricity emissions. I conclude that energy efficiency can provide significant benefits for reducing energy expenditures, CO2e and other pollutants, and renewables investment costs under policy mandates, even after accounting for the rebound effect. While the CO2e rebound effect is currently modest in the U.S., there are some exceptions that may be relevant for energy efficiency policy assessments. In addition, more data collection and measurements of direct rebound effects are needed, especially in developing countries where the demand for energy services has not fully been met.",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:26,,,,,,,Energy Efficiency and Rebound Effects in the United States,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716243.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SKS7F8DI,thesis,2014,"Min, Jihoon","Energy Efficient Lighting: Consumer Preferences, Choices, and System Wide Effects",,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Energy_Efficient_Lighting_Consumer_Preferences_Choices_and_System_Wide_Effects/6716246/1,"Lighting accounts for nearly 20% of overall U.S. electricity consumption, 14% of U.S. residential electricity consumption, and 6% of total U.S. carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions. A transition to alternative energy-efficient technologies could reduce this energy consumption considerably. We studied three questions related to energy efficiency lighting choices and consequences, which are: • Question 1: How large is the system-wide effect of a residential lighting retrofit with more efficient lighting technologies? • Question 2: Based on stated preference (SP) data, which factors influence consumer choices for general service light bulbs? What is the effect of the new lighting efficiency label mandated by the Federal Trade Commission? • Question 3: What can we learn about market trends and consumer choices from consumer panel data (i.e. revealed preference (RP) data) for general service light bulbs between 2004 and 2009? How can we compare the findings from SP and RP data, and which findings are robust across the two? In Chapter 2, we focus on the issue of lighting heat replacement effects. The issue is as follows: lighting efficiency goals have been emphasized in various U.S. energy efficiency policies. However, incandescent bulbs release up to 95% of input energy as heat, and it has been argued that replacing them with more efficient alternatives has a side effect in the overall building energy consumption: it increases the heating service that needs to be provided by the heating systems and decreases the cooling service that needs to be provided by the cooling systems. We investigate the net energy consumption, CO2e emissions, and saving in energy bills for single family detached houses across the U.S. as one moves towards more efficient lighting systems. In some regions, these heating and cooling effects from more efficient lighting can undermine up to 40% of originally intended primary energy savings, erode anticipated carbon savings completely, and lead to 30% less household monetary savings than intended. However, this overall effect is at most one percent of total emissions or energy consumption by a house. The size of the effect depends on various regional factors such as climate, electricity fuel mix, differences in emission factors of main energy sources used for heating and cooling, and electricity prices. Other tested factors such as building orientation, insulation level, occupancy scenario, or day length do not significantly affect the results. Then, in Chapter 3, we focus on factors that drive consumer choices for light bulbs. We collected stated preference data from a choice-based conjoint field experiment with 183 participants. We estimate discrete choice models from the data and find that politically liberal consumers have a stronger preference for compact fluorescent lighting technology and for low energy consumption. Greater willingness-to-pay for lower energy consumption and longer life is observed in conditions where estimated operating cost information was provided. Providing estimated annual cost information to consumers reduces their implicit discount rate by a factor of five, lowering barriers to adoption of energy efficient alternatives with higher up-front costs; however, even with cost information provided, consumers continue to use implicit discount rates of around 100%, which is larger than that estimated for other energy technologies. Finally, we complemented the stated preference study with a revealed preference study. This is because stated preference data alone have limitations in explaining consumer choices, as purchases are affected by many other factors that are outside of the experimenter control. We investigate consumer preferences for lighting technology based on revealed preference data between 2004 and 2009. We assess the trends in lighting sales for different lighting technologies across the country, and by store type. We find that, across the period between 2004 and 2009, sales of all general service light bulbs are almost monotonically decreasing, while CFL sales peaked in 2007. Thanks to increasing adoption of CFLs during the period, newly purchased light bulbs contributed to lowering carbon emissions and electricity consumption, while not sacrificing total produced lumens as much. We study consumer preferences for real light bulbs by estimating choice models, from which we estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) for light bulb attributes (watt and type) and implicit discount rates (IDR) consumers adopt for their purchases. We find that the campaign for efficient bulbs in Wal-Mart in 2007 is potentially related to the peak in CFL adoption in 2007 in addition to the effects of the EISA or other factors/programs around the same period. Consumers are willing to pay, $1.84 more for a change from an incandescent bulb to a CFL and -$0.06 for 10W increase, the values which also include willingness-to-pays for corresponding changes in unobserved variables such as life and color. IDRs for four representative states range between around 230% and 330%, which is in a similar range we estimate from the choice experiment. Overall, even with energy efficiency labels, nationwide promotion of CFLs by retailers, or better availability of CFLs in the transforming residential lighting market, we see the barriers to energy efficient residential lighting are still persistent, which are reflected in high implicit discount rates observed from the models. While we can expect the EISA to be effective in lowering the barriers through regulation, it alone will not close energy efficiency gap in the residential lighting sector.",12/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:26,,,,,,,Energy Efficient Lighting,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716246.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work studies two different approaches to the optimal allocation of energy and reserves in the day-ahead generation scheduling process. Part I presents a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment model to co-optimize energy and the locational reserves required to respond to a set of uncertain generation contingencies, using a novel state-based formulation. The model is applied in an offer-based electricity market to allocate contingency reserves throughout the power grid, in order to comply with the N-1 security criterion under transmission congestion. The objective is to minimize expected dispatch and reserve costs, together with post contingency corrective redispatch costs, modeling the probability of generation failure and associated post contingency states. The characteristics of the scheduling problem are exploited to formulate a computationally efficient method, consistent with established operational practices. We simulated the distribution of locational contingency reserves on the IEEE RTS96 system and compared the results with the conventional deterministic method. We found that assigning locational spinning reserves can guarantee an N-1 secure dispatch accounting for transmission congestion at a reasonable extra cost. The simulations also showed little value of allocating downward reserves but sizable operating savings from co-optimizing locational nonspinning reserves. Overall, the results indicate the computational tractability of the proposed method. Part II presents a distributed generation scheduling model to optimally allocate energy and spinning reserves among competing generators in a day-ahead market. The model is based on the coordination between individual generators and a market entity. The proposed method uses forecasting, augmented pricing and locational signals to induce efficient commitment of generators based on firm posted prices. It is price-based but does not rely on multiple iterations, minimizes information exchange and simplifies the market clearing process. Simulations of the distributed method performed on a six-bus test system showed that, using an appropriate set of prices, it is possible to emulate the results of a conventional centralized solution, without need of providing make-whole payments to generators. Likewise, they showed that the distributed method can accommodate transactions with different products and complex security constraints.",12/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:26,,,,,,,Ensuring the Reliable Operation of the Power Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716279.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first tool integrates the economic input-output approach of life cycle assessment with environmental fate, exposure and risk assessment to estimate the spatial distribution of air toxic health risks due to sector-specific economic activity in the US. The model is used to relate the economic activity and exposure potential (population density and meteorology) associated with point source emissions of the heavy metal and carcinogen, hexavalent chromium, or Cr(VI), on a county basis. The results indicate that linking economic activity, emission estimates, and fate and transport models for air toxics can inform both life cycle impact and comparative health risk assessments, allowing us to better target emission reductions to minimize hot-spots of risk. The second tool is a framework for science-based assessment and multi-stakeholder deliberation. The framework combines attributes of existing tools for environmental assessment and management, such as multiple criteria analysis, integrated assessment, and uncertainty analysis. It consists of two parts: a DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-States-Impacts-Responses) analysis to identify the important causal relationships among anthropogenic environmental stressors, processes, and outcomes; and a Decision Landscape analysis which aims to ensure that relevant legal, institutional, and social factors affecting a decision, as well as the knowledge, values, and decision making of participants in the various elements of the DPSIR process, are recognized and considered. The framework is applied to coral reef protection and restoration in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, focusing on anthropogenic stressors, such as domestic wastewater. A structured elicitation of values and beliefs conducted at a coral reef management workshop held at Key West, Florida is used to develop information for an integrated DPSIR/Decision Landscape framework. The framework identifies key DPSIR relationships, current scientific understanding, and stakeholder perceptions, which can be used together to predict the outcomes of management options and to identify future research needed to resolve conflict among stakeholders over scientific understanding and preferred management options. The third tool is aimed at identifying where additional scientific research may be needed to support better informed decisions and resolve possible conflicts over preferred management actions. The method combines and builds on aspects of multiple stakeholder deliberation, multiple criteria analysis, Bayesian Belief Networks, and value of information analysis. The method is applied to coral reef protection and restoration in the Guánica Bay Watershed, Puerto Rico, focusing on assessing and managing anthropogenic stressors, such as sedimentation and pollution from inland sources such as sewage, agriculture, and development. Structured elicitations of values and beliefs conducted at a coral reef management workshop held at La Parguera, Puerto Rico are used to develop information for demonstrating the method. Beliefs and preferred management options are examined for whether they exhibit greater coherence between stakeholders when informed by plausible study results. The results indicate that new scientific research is likely to bring people who initially disagree to agree. However, there can be situations where prior beliefs may be too different from the study results to shift perspectives and bring people to agreement. Though preliminary these results suggest that the method can provide useful insights on the social implications of a research program.",12/1/11,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:26,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716315.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first study we focus on the deployment of green field next generationaccess network infrastructures when the national regulatory authority has thepower to define geographical markets at sub-national level for which it can applydifferentiated regulatory remedies - Geographically Segmented Regulation(GSR). Using a game theory model that we developed, we confirm the asymmetricbusiness case for the geographic development of these new infrastructures:highly populated areas are likely to develop into competitive telecommunicationmarkets while regions with low household density will only see limited investmentand little or no competition. We show that supply side interdependenciesamong markets make the implementation of GSR non-trivial, namely, we showthat changes in the wholesale access price in one market can have undesirableconsequences in the competitive conditions of interrelated regions wherewholesale prices are unchanged. In the second study we focus on how individual purchase decisions are influenced by the behavior of others in their social circle. We study the case ofthe diffusion of the iPhone 3G across a number of communities sampled froma dataset provided by a major mobile carrier in one country. We find thatthe propensity of adoption increases with the proportion of each indivudal'sadopter friends. We estimate that 14% of iPhone 3G adoptions in this carrierwere due to peer influence. We provide results from several policy experimentsthat show that with this level of effect from peer influence the carrier wouldhardly be able to significantly increase sales by selectively targeting consumersto benefit from viral marketing. Finally, in the third study, we perform a randomized field experiment todetermine the role that likes play on the sales of movies in Video-on-Demand(VoD). We use the VoD system of a large telecommunications provider duringhalf a year in 2012. The system suggests movies to consumers ordered by thenumber of consumer likes they obtained in previous weeks. We manipulatedsuch natural order by randomly swapping likes across movies. We found thatmovies promoted (demoted) increased (decreased) sales, but the amount of informationpublicly available about movies affected the result. Better knownmovies were less sensitive to manipulations. Finally a movie promoted (demoted)to a fake slot sold 15.9% less (27.7% more) than a true movie placed atthat slot, on average across all manipulations. A movie promoted (demoted)to a fake slot received 33.1% fewer (30.1% more) likes than a true movie atthat slot. Hence manipulated movies tended to move back to their true slotsover time.

In this thesis, we examine the role of different recommendation schemes, spanning from interpersonal recommendations in social environment given by peers to product display recommendations in physical shopping environment given by sellers on consumers’ switching and search behavior in two distinct case studies. In the first study, we look at the effect of peer recommendations on subscriber churn in a large mobile network. We find that consumers’ propensity to churn increases with the number of friends that churn and in particular with the number of strong friends that churn. In the second study, we implement an in-vivo randomized field experiment to measure the effect of product display recommendations as book placement on shopper behavior in a physical bookstore. We leverage video tracking technologies to monitor how shoppers respond to random book placement, which induces random search costs. We find that books recommended at the edge of the table are more likely to be picked and taken than those placed at the center of the table. More interestingly, we also find that conditional on being picked, shoppers are equally likely to take books placed at the edge and at the center of the table, suggesting that display recommendations positively affect consumer choice mainly through its effect on the search process and not through its effect on the consideration process. Therefore, we empirically show that provision of recommendations, although in different schemes, may generally help to reduce consumers’ search costs in product or service discovery process, relative to what they would do without such an intervention. Moreover, we perform a comparative analysis between offline and online applications of recommender systems to systematically investigate the current practices, future prospects and policy perspectives when applying recommender systems in physical retailing. All these issues highlight opportunities for physical retailers to design, implement and evaluate their recommender systems that offer convenience benefits and appropriate protection to consumers.",5/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:26,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716402.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The massive disruptive challenges call for telecom companies to react with efficient strategic managerial policies. Meanwhile, how consumer decision makings and welfare are impacted by such policies often remains complicated and non-transparent to policy makers. My thesis aims at leveraging large-scale empirical data to investigate the impacts of several prevalent firm initiated strategies on both sides of the market, i.e. consumers and firms. The thesis is comprised of three studies focusing on consumer switch, search and purchase behaviors. The first study, centering at consumer switching behaviors, investigates the impact of lock in shortening policies on both firm profits and consumer welfare in home-based telecommunication service market. Using household level data from a large telecommunications service provider, we show that a market level policy that shortens the lock-in period from the status quo can decrease the profits on the firms side more than it increases consumer surplus. This is majorly caused by the substantial acquisition costs associated with user switching and service initiation. As a result if regulators shorten lock-in periods but then firms respond by collaboratively increasing prices to recover their rate of return, the consumers, as the analyses indicate, may be worse off compared to the world in which lock-in periods do not change. Therefore lock-in reduction policy need to be paired with a policy precluding operators from increasing prices too much. The later two studies jointly examine consumer’s search and purchase behaviors in social environment. With a wide scope of services, telecommunication service providers can often leverage their knowledge on consumer’s social environment to reshape consumer choices. We aim to understand how consumers combine different sources of social information, one from friends versus one from the crowd, as a function of how close they are to the point of conversion. We developed a dynamic structural econometric model that jointly describes consumer information search and product purchase while taking into account sequential arrival of information and non-negligible search costs. The model is then instantiated on two connected yet distinct empirical contexts, where consumers shop for movies to watch on home screens. The first empirical context (discussed in the second study in this thesis) lies in an observational setting, where we studied individual level clickstream and transactional data from a Video-on- Demand service platform operated by a large telecommunication service provider. Later in the third study, we created an artificial movie market and leveraged a randomized web experiment to further study the research questions with more solid identification support. We find that, in both contexts, consumers seem to start by browsing products they heard about from friends. The popularity signals become more relevant when consumers getting closer to the point of purchase. The results have important managerial implications to online vendors by suggesting a reasonable strategy of providing the most valuable social information at the right time to enhance consumer shopping experiences.",5/1/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,Essays on Telecommunications Management,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716456.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employing a chemical transport model (CTM) is the most rigorous way to address these atmospheric processes. The first part of this thesis analyzed the potential risk of ammonia emissions from post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology using a CTM. It was found that, if not controlled properly, CCS ammonia may create a serious public health problem, substantially compromising the benefit of reducing carbon dioxide. The results will guide the level of appropriate control for a wide range of future scenarios. CTMs are expensive from a computational standpoint and, therefore, beyond the reach of policy analysis for many types of problems. On the other hand, current tools used for policy analysis fall short of the rigor of CTMs and may lead to biased results. To address this gap, we developed the Estimating Air Pollution Social Impacts Using Regression (EASIUR) method, which builds parameterizations that predict per-tonne social cost and intake fraction at any location in the United States like a CTM with negligible computational costs. With tagged CTM simulations, the EASIUR method builds a dataset of air quality impacts for a large number of representative emissions sources in the United States and then derives parameterizations for those results. We used an “average plume,” a generic PM2.5 plume generated from CTM results, to describe the exposed population over large receptor areas around an emissions source. The parameterizations have intuitive functional forms with population and common atmospheric variables; their coefficients explain key underlying mechanisms. Out-of-sample evaluations meet the ‘excellent’ criteria of a common air quality model performance metric in most cases, with some exceptions meeting the ‘good’ criteria. We found that the average seasonal per-tonne social costs in the United States are $150,000-180,000/t EC, $21,000-34,000/t SO2, $4,200-15,000/t NOx, and $29,000-85,000/t NH3. It is hoped that the EASIUR model will be of great use in policy research that involves changes in air quality.",2/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,Evaluation of Air Quality Impacts on Society,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716489.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The work presented in this thesis focuses on understanding the effects of policies that influence science and technology interventions, and determining the impact of science and technology interventions themselves. Chapter 1 explores how the USA PATRIOT and Bioterrorism Preparedness Acts affected scientific progress. Regulations and guidance stemming from these pieces of legislation placed restrictions on microbiological research involving certain dangerous pathogens, including B. anthracis and Ebola virus. On a macro level, results indicated that research involving virulent strains of these organisms was not inhibited by the biosecurity laws. The most striking negative effect was a loss of efficiency. Chapter 2 examines a pilot research intervention in information and communication technology for development (ICTD). Initial assessments in the field indicated that technology has the potential to be successfully implemented in an underserved community. Researchers’ experience in the field also identified the challenges and rewards of conducting field research in ICTD. Chapter 3 presents the PREval (Pilot Research Evaluation) framework, which was developed to address the specific needs and challenges of ICTD field researchers. This framework draws from established evaluation techniques and other available resources on project assessment, but offers instructions customized for ICTD pilot research interventions. Initial testing of the concept behind PREval indicated that it can be feasibly applied to a range of ICTD projects and has the potential to add value to ICTD pilot project evaluations. Chapter 4 demonstrates the potential for an assistive technology tool to impact a developing community in the long term. This study examined whether the use of the Braille Writing Tutor could be sustained within the Mathru School for the Blind in India. Sustainability was explored at the micro level based on three dimensions: financial, technological and social. Findings suggest that this assistive technology is financially and socially sustainable given the current conditions at the Mathru School. However, the technology can be modified to render it more technologically sustainable at this location.",8/1/11,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,Evaluation of Policy and Research Interventions in Science and Technology,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716504.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Boundary organizations and boundary chains have been promoted as ways to help mitigate the problematic effects these divisions have on the successful communication of climate adaptation information in the water management sector. In this dissertation, I present three studies that were conducted in two regions to further explore stakeholder groups and the boundary chains that connect them. Both areas (Guanacaste, Costa Rica and Montana, USA) are historically agricultural regions experiencing ongoing environmental and socio-economic shifts. A mental models approach involving the use of interviews and surveys was used in each study area. The first two studies were conducted in Guanacaste and focused on comparing stakeholder group perceptions of their water system and hydro-climate information and on the differences in trust in forecast sources and its impact on forecast use. The results of these studies suggest that there is a distinction between the perceptions of larger stakeholder groups (e.g. government agencies or large farmers) and smaller groups (e.g. local water committees), and that this division suggests a need for boundary-type translation work. The third study was conducted in Montana with a focus on what communication strategies are used by, and what prompts engagement with, a boundary chain connecting rural agriculturalists to urban scientists. The results show that members of the network generally agree that for successful communication it is important both to not engage in ways viewed as attacks on agriculture and to make attempts to understand and respect local agricultural contexts. While there is some tension in the network, overall “buy-in” to the goal of bridging divides appears to be a common reason for engagement. In addition, organizations engage with the boundary chain for both the opportunity to connect to others and because of the need for translation between the concerns and logistics of different groups.",5/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716576.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long Term Evolution (LTE)-Advanced is expected to allow aggregation of multiple Component Carriers (CC) to fulfill the high data rate requirement. This thesis, presents an exploratory study of spectrum aggregation technology. First, it analyzes the technology’s technical impact on wireless networks. Second, it estimates the costs and benefits of the SA technology when building out a wireless network. Then, it presents a study case to compare the feasibility of SA technology versus spectrum refarming. Furthermore, the thesis studies SA’s impact on valuation of spectrum by operators. Finally, it discusses the implications of SA on spectrum policies. Results show that LTE systems that use spectrum aggregation over fragmented blocks of spectrum can have better performance compared to Independent Carrier (IC) systems. In addition, aggregating carriers from multiple bands could permit the system to have a better performance in certain circumstances. Moreover, SA technology could have a positive impact on the benefits and costs of nationwide LTE networks. In a case study for using SA over fragmented spectrum in the TV band, the advantages and disadvantages of the use of the technology versus repacking the spectrum physically to create contiguous band are observed and discussed. After empirically studying operators’ willingness to pay for contiguous and low-frequency spectrum, simulation is used to measure the impact of SA on the operators’ valuation for spectrum blocks. Results show that the technology could lead to more linear valuation of spectrum units. Finally, SA impact on spectrum policies is studied and specific recommendations are given to regulators to help exploit fragmentation of spectrum through the technology and encourage fairer access to spectrum by competitors.",5/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,Exploring Spectrum Aggregation Technology,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716597.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis addresses both large-scale wind integration (Papers 1-3) and development of new energy technologies (Paper 4) in service of this goal. Compressed air energy storage (CAES) could be paired with a wind farm to provide firm, dispatchable baseload power, or serve as a peaking plant and capture upswings in electricity prices. Paper 1 presents a firm-level engineering-economic analysis of a wind/CAES system with a wind farm in central Texas, load in either Dallas or Houston, and a CAES plant whose location is profit-optimized. Of a range of market scenarios considered, the CAES plant is found to be profitable only given the existence of large and infrequent price spikes. Social benefits of wind/CAES include avoided construction of new generation capacity, improved air quality during peak demand, and increased economic surplus, but may not outweigh the private cost of the CAES system nor justify a subsidy. Like CAES, pumped hydropower storage (PHS) ramps quickly enough to smooth wind power and could profit from arbitrage on short-term price fluctuations exacerbated by large-scale wind. Germany has aggressive plans for wind power expansion, and Paper 2 analyzes an investment opportunity in a PHS facility in Norway that practices arbitrage in the German spot market. Price forecasts given increased wind capacity are used to calculate profit-maximizing production schedules and annual revenue streams. Real options theory is used to value the investment opportunity, since unlike net present value, it accounts for uncertainty and intertemporal choice. Results show that the optimal investment strategy under the base scenario is to wait approximately eight years then invest in the largest available plant. Paper 3 examines long-distance interconnection as an alternate method of wind power smoothing. Frequency-domain analysis indicates that interconnection of aggregate regional wind plants across much of the western and mid-western U.S. would not result in significantly greater smoothing than interconnection within a single region. Time-domain analysis shows that interconnection across regions reduces the magnitude of low-probability step changes and doubles firm power output (capacity available at least 92 % of the time) compared with a single region. An approximate cost analysis indicates that despite these benefits, balancing wind and providing firm power with local natural gas turbines would be more cost-effective than with transmission interconnection. Papers 1 and 3 demonstrate the need for further RD&D (research, development, and deployment) of low-carbon energy technologies. Energy technology development is highly uncertain but most often modeled as deterministic, which neglects the ability both to adapt RD&D strategy to changing conditions and to invest in initially high-cost technologies with small breakthrough probabilities. Paper 4 develops an analytical stochastic dynamic programming framework in which RD&D spending decreases the expected value of the stochastic cost of a technology. Results for a two-factor cost model (which separates RD&D into R&D and learning-by-doing) applied to carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) indicate that given 15 years until large-scale deployment, investment in the RD&D program is optimal over a very broad range of initial mitigation costs ($10-$380/tCO2). While the NPV of the program is zero if initial mitigation cost is $100/tCO2, under uncertainty the program is worth about $7 billion. If initial mitigation cost is high, the program is worth most if cost reductions exogenous to the program (e.g. due to private sector activity) are also high. Factors that promote R&D spending over learning-by-doing include more imminent deployment, high initial cost, lower exogenous cost reductions, and lower program funds available.",5/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716621.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, not much is known about their influence, if any, on technology trajectories. This dissertation explores the relationship between the burst of the telecommunications bubble and the rate and direction of innovation of United States (U.S.) inventors in optoelectronics, a technology pivotal to the telecommunications industry. Leveraging a hand-built dataset of 790 inventor CVs, we analyze optoelectronics’ inventor market shifts and associated innovation outcomes before, during, and after the burst of the telecommunications bubble. We find that the burst of the bubble disproportionately reduced inventor innovation in the rest of the field compared to the emerging general purpose technology (GPT) enabler. An increase in the emerging GPT-enabler post-burst is driven by Super Star inventors (top 1.5% both by cumulative patents and annual patenting pre-bubble) that switch markets applications post-burst out of diversified firms with telecommunications divisions and into firms focused exclusively on telecommunications. These Super Stars continue an increase in integration patenting that was driven during the bubble by Non Stars who left a period of unemployment, other markets and academia and went into firms focused on telecommunications and diversified firms with telecommunications divisions. These superstars do not act in an institutional vacuum, however. There were several factors that influenced the growth of innovation in optoelectronics. This dissertation explores the ways vi that the location of research in different kinds of organizations, government funding and government regulation have combined to influence innovation worldwide in optoelectronics. Analyzing patenting patterns in optoelectronics between 1955 and 2010, we identify the most influential firms, government agencies and individuals responsible for leading innovation in this field. We use archival data on firms’ decisions, firms’ market applications and collect oral histories on key individuals. We find evidence for co-operation and competition between academia and industry in the early years. We also find that the most prolific firms are not the most influential. In addition, government regulation influenced innovation in at least two unexpected ways: by limiting U.S. permanent residents from defense applications of the technology and by inspiring new ventures when mergers were delayed by Department of Justice investigations. This dissertation contributes to research on innovation and mobility, and to academic discourse on the relationship between business cycles and technology trajectories. Previous research in the field of mobility and innovation that has used patent data to estimate mobility is limited by inventors only showing up in patent data if they patent after they move, thus biasing the observed sample. CV data disentangles the relationship between mobility and patenting. With respect to business cycles, our results suggest that both non-stars and super-stars may have important roles in pushing innovation frontiers during different parts of the business cycle. While super-stars advance the emerging GPT enabler during resource-constrained parts of the business cycle, they continue the efforts of non-stars during less constrained times. This suggests there may be a role for government in supporting emerging-GPT-enabler innovations during economic downturns.",5/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,Following the Light,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716999.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The availability of low cost low natural gas, the Fukushima accident, and the cancellation of the AP1000 V.C. Summer project has caused a considerable role in ending the short lived “Nuclear Renaissance.” Historically, the nuclear industry has focused on direct cost reduction through construction, increasing installed capacity, and improving efficiencies to capacity factors in the 1990s and 2000s as ways to maintain competitiveness against other forms of energy generation. With renewables serving as an emerging low-carbon competitor, an added focus needs to be placed on indirect methods to increase the competitiveness of nuclear power. This thesis focuses on establishing pathways where nuclear power can be competitive with other forms of electricity generation given its advantages environmentally with Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), socioeconomically with legacy nuclear power plants, and through passive safety with SMRs. In Chapter 2, I estimate the life cycle GHG emissions and examine the cost of carbon abatement when nuclear is used to replace fossil fuels for the Westinghouse SMR (W-SMR) and AP1000. I created LCA models using past literature and Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the mean (and 90% confidence interval) life cycle GHG emissions of the W-SMR to be 7.4 g of CO2-eq/kwh (4.5 to 11.3 g of CO2-eq/kwh) and the AP1000 to be 7.6 g of CO2-eq/kwh (5.0 to 11.3 g of CO2-eq/kwh). Within the analysis I find that the estimated cost of carbon abatement with an AP1000 against coal and natural gas is $2/tonne of CO2-eq (-$13 to $26/tonne of CO2-eq) and $35/tonne of CO2-eq ($3 to $86/tonne of CO2-eq), respectively. In comparison, a W-SMR the cost of carbon abatement against coal and natural gas is $3/tonne of CO2- eq (-$15 to $28/tonne of CO2-eq) and $37/tonne of CO2-eq (-$1 to $90/tonne of CO2-eq), respectively. I conclude, with the exception of hydropower, the Westinghouse SMR design and the AP1000 have a smaller footprint than all other generation technologies including renewables. Assigning a cost to carbon for natural gas plant or implementing zero-emission incentives can improve the economic competitiveness of nuclear power through environmental competitiveness. The retirement of small and medium-scale coal power plants due the availability of natural gas can provide an opportunity for SMRs to replace that missing capacity. This trade-off between higher costs but lower GHG emissions demonstrates that depending on the value placed on carbon, SMR technology could be economically competitive with fossil fuel technologies Following my environmental competitiveness analysis, I shift towards investigating socioeconomic competitiveness of legacy large scale nuclear power plants compared to baseload coal and natural gas plants. In Chapter 3, I utilize ANOVA models, Tukey’s, and t-tests to explore the socioeconomic characteristics and disparities that exist within counties and communities that contain baseload power plants. My results indicate, relative to the home counties of nuclear plants, communities closer to nuclear plants have higher home values and incomes than those further away. Conversely, communities near coal and natural gas have incomes and home values that increase with distance from the plant. Communities near coal plants are typically either in less wealthy parts of the county or have a similar socioeconomic makeup as county. It can be suggested that equity issues regarding the community characteristics could be included in the discussion of converting existing power plants to use other fuel sources. Communities near power plants are not created equally and have different needs. While communities near nuclear power plants may benefit from the added tax base and absence of emissions, this is not the case for communities near coal and natural gas. With the impending retirement of large scale coal plants, the conversion of these plants to natural gas or small modular reactors presents an opportunity where negative environmental externalities can be reduced while also retaining some of the economic benefits. In Chapter 4, I present a model for estimating environmental dose exposure in a post-accident scenario to support scalable emergency planning zones (EPZs). The model includes calculating radionuclide inventory; estimating the impact decontamination factors from the AP1000, NUREG-6189, and EPRI’s Experimental Verification of Post-Accident iPWR Aerosol Behavior test will have on radioactivity within containment; and estimate dose exposure using atmospheric dispersion models. This work aims to compare historical decontamination factors with updated decontamination factors to outline the impact on containment radioactivity and dose exposure relative to the Environmental Protection Agency’s Protective Action Guide (PAG) limits. On average, I have found the AP1000, Surry, and iPWR produces 139, 153, and 104 curies/ft3 75 minutes after a LOCA. The iPWR produces less radioactivity per volume in containment than the AP1000 and Surry 84% and 96% of the time, respectively. The AP1000 produces less radioactivity per volume than Surry 68% of the time. On average, the AP1000, Surry, and iPWR produces 84,000, 106,000, and 7,000 curies/MWth 75 minutes after a LOCA. The lower bound 5 rem PAG limit is never exceeded for and does not exceeds the 1 rem lower PAG limit for whole body exposure at the 5-mile EPZ using the mean value. Considering this analysis uses a simple worst case Gaussian Plume model for atmospheric dispersion, the findings can be used to in conjunction with the State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses (SOARCA) to provide accurate and realistic estimates for exposure. I believe this analysis can help to develop a regulatory basis for technology-neutral, risk-based approach to EPZs for iPWRs. Finally, in Chapter 5 I discuss historical challenges facing the nuclear industry, policy implications, and recommendations. These policy implications and recommendations serve as pathways to frame an new nuclear renaissance. I also recommend future work where I details opportunities for improvements to nuclear competitiveness. Ultimately, this thesis can help policy and decision makers that can improve competitiveness and minimize risk as it relates to the expansion of nuclear power sector.",5/1/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6717320.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Daniel","Fuel, Feedstock, or Neither? – Evaluating Tradeoffs in the use of Biomass for Greenhouse Gas Mitigation",,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Fuel_Feedstock_or_Neither_Evaluating_Tradeoffs_in_the_use_of_Biomass_for_Greenhouse_Gas_Mitigation/6717413/1,"Biomass is the world’s largest renewable energy source, accounting for approximately 10% of global primary energy supply, and 5% of energy consumed in the United States. Prominent national programs like the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard incentivize increased use of biomass, primarily as a transportation fuel. There has been comparatively little government support for using biomass as a renewable feedstock for the chemical sector. Such asymmetry in incentives can lead to sub-optimal outcomes in the allocation of biomass toward different uses. Greenhouse gas reduction is among the most cited benefits of bioenergy and bio-based products, however, there is increasing controversy about whether increased use of biomass can actually contribute to greenhouse gas emission targets. If biomass is to play a role in current and future greenhouse gas mitigation efforts its use should be guided by efficient use of natural and economic resources. This thesis addresses these questions through a series of case studies, designed to highlight important tradeoffs in the use of biomass for greenhouse gas mitigation. Should biomass be used as a fuel, a chemical feedstock, or neither? The first case study in this thesis focuses on the ‘fuel vs feedstock’ question, examining the greenhouse gas implications of expanding the scope of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard to include credits for bioethylene, an important organic chemical readily produced from bioethanol. Results suggest that an expanded policy that includes bioethylene as an approved use for ethanol would provide added flexibility without compromising greenhouse gas targets – a clear win scenario. Having established that bioethylene based plastics can achieve similar greenhouse gas reductions to bioethanol used as fuel, this thesis expands the analysis by considering how the greenhouse gas emissions from a wider range of bio-based plastics compare to each of the main commodity thermoplastics produced in the U.S. The analysis demonstrates that there are large uncertainties involved in the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from bio-based plastics, and that only a subset of pathways are likely to be preferable to conventional plastics. The following chapter then builds on the existing model to compare the greenhouse gas mitigation potential of bio-based plastics to the potential for reducing emissions by adopting low carbon energy for plastics production. That chapter concludes that switching to renewable energy across the supply chain for conventional plastics energy cuts greenhouse gas emissions by 50-75%, achieving a greater reduction, with less uncertainty and lower cost, than switching to corn-based biopolymers – the most likely near-term biopolymer option. In the long run, producing bio-based plastics from advanced feedstocks (e.g. switchgrass) and/or with renewable energy likely offers greater emission reductions. Finally, this thesis returns to the dominant form of policy surrounding biomass use: biofuel mandates. That study takes a consequential approach to the ‘fuel or neither’ question. Specifically, this work examines how petroleum refineries are likely to adjust their production in response to biofuel policies, and what this implies for the success of these policies. The research demonstrates that biofuel policies induce a shift toward greater diesel production at the expense of both gasoline and non-combustion petroleum products. This has the potential to result in an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, even before accounting for the emissions from producing the biofuels themselves.",12/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,"Fuel, Feedstock, or Neither?",,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6717413.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has the potential to allow the continued use of fossil fuels with little or no emissions until alternative, low-to-zero emission sources of energy are more widely deployed. This thesis considers the legal and economic implications of securing the right to use geologic pore space—the microscopic space in subsurface rock matrixes—in an effort to sequester CO2 deep underground to mitigate climate change. The findings and conclusions drawn in this thesis are intended to help guide discussion, research, and decision-making processes undertaken by policymakers and industry leaders with respect to the commercial-scale deployment of CCS. Prior to the commencement of sequestration, a project developer/operator must have authorization to access and use pore space to avoid liability for subsurface trespass. This authorization can be acquired via bilateral contract, where monetary compensation is remitted to the property owner in exchange for the right to use pore space. However, the question remains open as to whether the use of pore space for geologic CO2 sequestration (GCS) is a trespass requiring compensation under the law. In fact, there is ample legal precedent in the context of underground injection activities such as enhanced hydrocarbon recovery, fluid waste disposal, and freshwater storage to support the supposition that the invasion of pore space by injected is compensable only when substantial harm or interference with an existing or non-speculative, investment-backed future use of the subsurface results from the injection of such fluids. This thesis shows that if CCS is widely deployed, the cost of electricity and power plant profitability could be adversely affected by a legal requirement that pore space owners must be compensated for GCS in all circumstances. Moreover, absent unrealistically high electricity prices or some form of sequestration subsidy, pore space has no net-positive, intrinsic economic value to electric generators that can be passed along to property owners. Therefore, while paying property owners to use of pore space for geologic CO2 sequestration may very well foster public acceptance and appease staunch private property rights advocates, there is no demonstrable legal or economic rationale for compensating property owners who have no current or nonspeculative, investment-backed future use of the subsurface where pore space targeted for sequestration is located. A pragmatic and equitable solution for constraining the potential negative economic effects associated with acquiring pore space rights would be for state or federal legislatures, or courts, to limit required compensation to only those instances where the injection and migration of CO2 materially impairs current or non-speculative, investment-backed future uses of the subsurface. Future work should include a detailed analysis of takings law and the anticipated long-term constitutional and economic implications of various approaches to pore space property rights governance before new CCS-specific laws are enacted. The models presented in this thesis should also be applied to additional site-specific geologic data for saline aquifer sequestration targets. Additionally, the implications of GCS paired with enhanced oil recovery (EOR) on power plant economics should be studied.",12/1/10,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,Geologic CO2 Sequestration and Subsurface Property Rights,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6718082.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The country is expected to become a net oil importer by the year 2011. To encourage renewable energy development and relieve the country’s emerging oil dependence, in 2006 the government mandated blending 5% palm-oil biodiesel in petroleum diesel. Malaysia produced 16 million tonnes of palm oil in 2007, mainly for food use. This study addresses maximizing bioenergy use from oil-palm to support Malaysia’s energy initiative while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions from land use change. When converting primary and secondary forests to oil-palm plantations between 270 - 530 g and 120 -190 g CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) per MJ of biodiesel produced, respectively, is released. However, converting degraded lands results in the capture of between 23 to 85 g CO2-eq per MJ of biodiesel produced. Using various combinations of land types, Malaysia could meet the 5% biodiesel target with a net GHG savings of about 1.03 million tonnes (4.9% of the transportation sector’s diesel emissions) when accounting for the emissions savings from the diesel fuel displaced. Fossil fuels contributed about 93% to Malaysia’s electricity generation mix and emit about 65 million tonnes (Mt) or 36% of the country’s 2010 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The government has set a target to install 330 MW biomass electricity by 2015, which is hoped to avoid 1.3 Mt of GHG emissions annually. The availability of seven types of biomass residues in Peninsular Malaysia is estimated based on residues-to-product ratio, recoverability and accessibility factor and other competing uses. It was found that there are approximately 12.2 Mt/yr of residues. Oil-palm residues contribute about 77% to the total availability with rice and forestry residues at 17%. Electricity from biomass can be produced via direct combustion in dedicated power plants or co-fired with coal. The co-firing of the residues at four existing coal plants in Peninsular Malaysia was modeled to minimize cost or GHG emissions. It is found that Malaysia can meet the 330 MW biomass electricity target via co-firing with a cost reduction of about $24 million compared to 100% coal. Optimal GHG reduction for co-firing was found to be 17 Mt lower than 100% coal at a cost of carbon mitigation (COM) of about $22.50/t CO2-eq mitigated. This COM is lower than an implied COM under the newly introduced levy on heavy electricity users in Malaysia. Gasoline consumed roughly 370 PJ of energy in Malaysia's transportation sector in 2009. Ethanol can be blended with gasoline up to 10% by volume in most vehicles. Peninsular Malaysia's 12.2 Mt/yr of agro-forestry residues can be used for potentially producing 3.8 billion liters ethanol annually. Using a large scale mixed-integer linear optimization, it is found that if Malaysia introduces a 10% ethanol-gasoline blend (E10), approximately 2.9 Mt (24%) of the residues would be used at $5.4 million more cost compared to 100% gasoline (reference case) estimated at $5.2 billion/yr. In the E10 scenario, all cities receive 10% ethanol altogether producing 900 million liters of ethanol. The GHG emissions for 100% gasoline is estimated at 26.4 Mt/yr. The minimum GHG emissions if E10 is implemented in Peninsular Malaysia was found to be 24.5 Mt, 2.0 Mt lower than 100% gasoline, which implies a $4.70/t CO2-eq cost of carbon mitigation (COM). Since only 24% of the available residues are used to produce the E10, the possibility of producing the E10 and electricity via co-firing with coal simultaneously was investigated. This is done by combining the fuel (gasoline/E10) model with the electricity (coal-only/co-firing) model. The costs of the reference case combined scenario (100% gasoline and 100% coal) is estimated at $6.3 billion/yr and emits 63 Mt/yr of GHG emissions. The minimum cost for producing the E10 and co-firing is found to be $30 million lower than the combined reference case. This is achieved by using 5.9 Mt of residues. The minimum GHG emissions level obtained is 17 Mt lower implying a COM of $19.00/t CO2-eq mitigated. The findings in this research are used to recommend policies for mitigating GHG emissions impacts from the growth of palm oil use in the transportation sector. Policy recommendations are also discussed to ensure a successful implementation of co-firing of biomass and the production of E10 by ensuring a guaranteed supply of residues and financing the high capital cost of the renewable energy program.",8/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,GHG Emissions and Costs of Developing Biomass Energy in Malaysia,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6718319.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To avoid causing harmful interference (i.e., interference causing disruptions in services), transmit power of a secondary device is dynamically adjusted. Various novel sharing mechanisms are proposed for two different types of primary system: cellular systems, and rotating radars. Both cases when primary and secondary systems cooperate (cooperative sharing), and when they do not (coexistent sharing) are considered. Based on analyses and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, this dissertation shows that useful secondary transmissions are possible even when the shared spectrum is considered 100% utilized by the primary system under conventional approaches to spectrum management. For example, in spectrum sharing with cellular systems, even when the primary system is 100% utilized, a modest extent of transmissions of around 0.01–0.03 bps/Hz is achievable for secondary transmitter and receiver that are 400 m apart. In spectrum sharing with radars, even in the scenario where radars are the most densely packed, a secondary transmitter can get almost 1.2 bps/Hz on average, when 5% of the transmitters are competing for the shared spectrum. This dissertation also shows the potential of sharing models in which a secondary system has information about a primary system, but does not cooperate in real time; such arrangements are not typically considered today. For sharing with radars, the case in which an OFDMA-based cellular system operates as the secondary spectrum-user in non-contiguous cells is considered, as might occur with a broadband hotspot service, or a cellular system using shared spectrum to supplement its dedicated spectrum. It is found that even with fluctuations and interruptions in secondary transmissions while radars rotate, the shared spectrum could be used efficiently for applications that generate much of the traffic on mobile Internet, including non-interactive video on demand, peer-to-peer file sharing, large file transfers, and web browsing, but not for applications such as real-time transfers of small files, and VoIP. For sharing with cellular systems, the efficiency of cooperative and coexistent sharing is compared based on performance of the secondary system measured as achievable transmissions, and performance of the cellular system measured as power consumption of a mobile device, which may be increased to compensate for additional interference from secondary transmissions. When both achievable secondary transmissions and primary power consumption are of concern, coexistent sharing is found to be as effective as cooperative sharing.",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6718853.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A small percentage of firms (5%) is responsible for a disproportionately large amount of net job creation (>50%). Named high growth firms, these successful enterprises have been in the spotlight of research looking into the key drivers of firm growth and growth policy. This dissertation explores high growth from multiple perspectives: at the level of the firm, by understanding how the definition of a high growth firm impacts its characteristics and expected performance over time; at the local level, by isolating the effect of political connections of firm performance and firm entry; and at the macro level, by observing the evolution of entrepreneurship during transition. The first study finds that most HGFs are unable to maintain high growth rates for long, but do register lower volatility in growth rates and a higher chance of survival. Results on growth volatility and persistence vary significantly with the specific definition of “high growth” used as well as with the specific variable used to measure growth (e.g., revenue, employees, profit, productivity). These findings have direct implications for growth policies and programs that depend on identifying HGFs. The second study indicates a strong significant effect of political alignment on revenue growth and firm entry. Larger firms take advantage of political connections for performance gains, while small firms are negatively impacted. Furthermore, alignment reduces entry into entrepreneurship by 8-11%. These findings establish political alignment and local-level business-politics collusion as important dynamics to consider when evaluating entrepreneurship policy in developing countries. The third study describes the interdependence between entrepreneurship, institutions, and transitions. The case of Romania shows that the beginning of transition was characterized by an initial explosion of newly created private enterprises, followed by a declining trend in enterprise creation and, recently, by a new increase in entrepreneurship activity. To conclude, this work contributes new perspectives towards a better understanding of high growth firms and growth policy. Policy implications are targeted towards transition and developing economies that have seen little representation in literature. The goal is to enable successful high growth policies across multiple levels.",12/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,High Growth Entrepreneurship,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6719819.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Estimates suggest that ideally, the electricity sector would be responsible for approximately 85% of emissions abatement associated with climate polices such as America’s Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES). This is equivalent to ~50% cumulative emissions reductions below projected cumulative business-as-usual (BAU) emissions. Achieving these levels of emissions reductions will require dramatic changes in the US electricity generating infrastructure: almost all of the fossil-generation fleet will need to be replaced with low-carbon sources and society is likely to have to maintain a high build rate of new capacity for decades. Unfortunately, the inertia in the electricity sector means that there may be physical constraints to the rate at which new electricity generating capacity can be built. Because the build rate of new electricity generating capacity may be limited, the timing of regulation is critical—the longer the U.S. waits to start reducing GHG emissions, the faster the turnover in the electricity sector must occur in order to meet the same target. There is a real, and thus far unexplored, possibility that the U.S. could delay climate change policy implementation for long enough that it becomes infeasible to attain the necessary rate of turnover in the electricity sector. This dissertation investigates the relationship between climate policy timing and infrastructure turnover in the electricity sector. The goal of the dissertation is to answer the question: How long can we wait before constraints on infrastructure turnover in the electricity sector make achieving our climate goals impossible? Using the Infrastructure Flow Assessment Model, which was developed in this work, this dissertation shows that delaying climate change policy increases average retirements rates by 200-400%, increases average construction rates by 25-85% and increases maximum construction rates by 50-300%. It also shows that delaying climate policy has little effect on the age of retired plants or the stranded costs associated with premature retirement. In order for the electricity sector to reduce emissions to a level required by ACES while limiting construction rates to within achievable levels, it is necessary to start immediately. Delaying the process of decarbonization means that more abatement will be necessary from other sectors or geoengineering. By not starting emissions abatement early, therefore, the US forfeits its most accessible abatement potential and increases the challenge of climate change mitigation unnecessarily.",5/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,How the Timing of Climate Change Policy Affects Infrastructure Turnover in the Electricity Sector,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6719882.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the construction and operation of large hydropower plants may affect the environment, the local economy, and the population surrounding those projects. Considering the magnitude of the investments and the potential impacts for the Amazon basin, it is crucial to apply policy analysis techniques to support informed decisions about whether the construction of large hydropower plants in the Amazon is the best alternative to supply the additional electricity that Brazil needs, taking into account economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits. Here, I apply three different quantitative policy analysis techniques to assess three major questions related to the construction of hydropower plants in the Amazon region.

I performed a safety transportation risk analysis, which shows a high fatality and injury risk from road crashes in Bogota. I then analyzed safety-related benefits and costs of crash avoidance technology used in transit buses. My analysis reveals that despite of the life-safety benefit expected, Bogota’s values of statistical life and injuries make an investment on the technology for buses fall into the economically unjustified ranges. To analyze traffic related air pollution emissions, I developed a link-based emission model, which then it’s used to explore the traffic-related air pollution impacts of a highway capacity enhancement plan and a scrappage program for private cars. I use a bottom-up model that couples detailed activity data from a TAM, developed in EMME/4, with various emissions factors to develop a high-resolution road traffic emissions inventory for Bogotá. In particular, I use three emission models to produce the traffic related emission inventory, which includes exhaust emissions of five criteria air pollutants: Carbon monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), Sulphur oxides (SO2), Particulate Matter (PM, particles with diameters of 10 micrometers and smaller), and Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions generated by hot-stabilized vehicle activity. The on-road vehicle emission model developed as part of this work marks an important turn over previous tools, because it opens the possibility to integrate environmental and transportation policy-making in Bogota.

Currently, we lack an understanding of the factors that drive users’ attention to security dialogs, and how to counteract habituation. Studying computer security behavior is difficult because a) users are more likely to expose themselves to risk in a lab experiment than in daily life, b) the size of observed effects is usually very small, which makes it necessary to collect many observations, and c) it is complex to balance research interests and the ethical duty not to harm.

Many governments have attempted or considered implementing policies or projects aimed at re-creating the success of Silicon Valley. However, it is not clear that we truly know what led to Silicon Valley’s success, as existing work has not pursued industry-wide firm-level analyses to examine the mechanisms that allowed Silicon Valley to emerge as a key region. This work seeks to begin to address this literature gap in order to better inform regional economic development policy moving forward. In examining the development of Silicon Valley and the semiconductor industry, a detailed analysis of the technological developments leading to both transistors and integrated circuits was performed. From this analysis, it became clear that the nature and availability of knowledge changed significantly between the transistor and integrated circuit eras, with knowledge becoming more complex, tacit, and less available throughout the industry. From this understanding, specific predictions and hypotheses regarding firm and industry development were generated guided by existing theory. Using a novel dataset of US semiconductor production between 1947 and 1987, this dissertation examines empirically the development of the semiconductor industry to test these hypotheses. The results show that the mechanisms driving success differed between the two eras of the semiconductor industry. As the industry transitioned to the transistor era, existing electronics firms dominated the industry, which resulted in a build-up of transistor firms in the same clusters that previously produced electronics products; however, this was not the case as the industry transitioned to integrated circuits. The nature of the knowledge in the integrated circuit era allowed spinoff firms to emerge as an important force in the industry, out-performing incumbent firms, which ultimately led to the emergence of Silicon Valley as the primary semiconductor industry cluster. It is important to understand the technological context that created an opportunity for spinoff firms to fuel Silicon Valley’s ascension to significance within the industry, as this dissertation demonstrates that the applicability of existing theories regarding firm entry and development are influenced by the nature of technology. Understanding the conditions under which various mechanisms can be effective in promoting firm entry and performance, and thus regional clusters is vital in order to craft efficient public policy and projects aimed at building industry clusters in the future.

Why do we continue to struggle with the management of deteriorating infrastructure systems when capable engineering systems exist for monitoring, identifying, andprioritizing facets of these systems? The prevailing view of infrastructure systems assumes that they are exogenous to society and thus largely focus on the social impacts of the technical facets of such systems (infrastructure → society). Utilizing institutional theory, science and technologystudies, and social movement theory, this thesis advances the perspective that social factors have an influence on the technical parameters of infrastructure systems; infrastructure is therefore endogenous to society (society → infrastructure). The interplay between social and technicalfactors is explored through three complementary sections using a variety of statistical methods and 21 years of data from the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) of the United States Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and other sources.The first paper explores the institutional constraints that inhibit bridge managers from addressing challenges with remediation of outdated bridges. More specifically, it depicts bridges as institutional relics, whereby a bridge’s physical attributes reflect the accepted standards of thetime and later persist even when those standards may change. Bridges are more likely to be institutional relics when built prior to the adoption of national design mandates (regulative-based relics) or in locales whose engineering norms conflict with these national standards (normativebased relics). Bridge ownership and the spatial constraints present in more urban settings moderate the ability of bridge managers to address those bridges that are identified as relics. The second paper focuses on the role of attachment to institutional relics and its potential toinspire collective action around preserving them. Specifically, it considers movements to enroll bridges into the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on closure rates and subsequent sufficiency. Not only do bridges enrolled on the NRHP have a lower risk of closure in postenrollmentyears as compared to similar non-enrolled bridges, but these movements also restrict engineering options on enrolled bridges, with improvements focused on non-historic elements (i.e. the bridge’s substructure). This informs social movement research by considering movements of preservation instead of change and how movements can directly influence the built environment as an end goal.In the third paper, bridge sufficiency is considered through the lens of inspection data to identify influential attributes affecting monitoring of potential institutional relics. A framework is developed for providing feedback to bridge managers, designers, and policymakers. Givencomputation challenges, previous studies understandably and necessarily begin with a limited scope, data, or variable selection. This study leverages novel computational techniques, namely a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach, that can morecomprehensively consider the entire United States bridge system and its variables to inform attribute selection. It finds that a mixture of inspector-driven variables, design/maintenance variables, and weather are highly influential in calculating overall bridge sufficiency rating.Many of the factors that persistently influence bridge sufficiency are also related to social challenges, namely the presence of institutional relics, explored previously. As such, this paper presents one possible computational approach for scoping the most salient technical and socialvariables for which bridge designers and managers should focus attention when seeking to monitor bridge deterioration. These results are then tied to contemporary issues in bridge management and used to propose policy actions within each section of findings to better address bridge management issues. In sum, this thesis helps advance a more sociological understanding toward infrastructure, namely how social parameters can influence engineering systems, as applied in the context of bridgesystems.",8/8/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,Infrastructure as Institutional Relics,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7212962.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

China has emerged as the world’s largest carbon emitter by a large margin, and many of its cities experience high levels of air pollution. The Chinese government has turned to wind – and later solar – as alternative power sources to help decarbonize its electricity system and ameliorate increasingly urgent air pollution problems. Through these efforts, China has markedly expanded the share of renewable energy in its energy mix, and in the process absorbed a fair amount of relatively advanced technology, establishing itself as a competitive location to manufacture clean power equipment. In short order China has bolstered its international standing as a renewable energy powerhouse. The first study evaluates the question of whether China's wind industry has become an important source of clean energy technology innovation. Results indicate that while China has delivered enormous progress in terms of wind capacity, the outcomes were more limited in terms of innovation and cost competitiveness. Chinese wind turbine manufacturers have secured few international patents and achieved moderate learning rates relative to the global industry’s historical learning rate. The success of China’s transition to a low-carbon energy system will be key to achieve the global level of emissions reductions needed to avoid large negative consequences from climate change. The second study shows that China made progress in bringing down the levelized cost of wind electricity and cost of carbon mitigation. However, widespread grid-connection issues and wind curtailment rates caused much higher-than-anticipated costs of renewable energy integration. China has emerged as the global manufacturing center for solar photovoltaic products, and Chinese firms have entered all stages of the supply chain in short order. The third study provides detailed expert assessments of the technological and nontechnological factors that led to the surprised success of China’s silicon photovoltaic industry.

Steady end uses like lighting are more than twice as profitable as seasonal end uses because spinning reserve is needed year-round. Avoided carbon emission damages from using demand response instead of fossil fuel generation for spinning reserve are sufficient to justify incentives for demand response resources. Chapter 3 quantifies the system-level net emissions rate and private economics of behind-the-meter energy storage. Net emission rates are lower than marginal emission rates for power plants and in-line with estimates of net emission rates from grid-level storage. The economics are favorable for many buildings in regions with high demand charges like California and New York, even without subsidies. Future penetration into regions with average charges like Pennsylvania will depend greatly on installation cost reductions and wholesale prices for ancillary services. Chapter 4 outlines a novel econometric model to quantify potential revenues from energy storage that reduces demand charges. The model is based on a novel predictive metric that is derived from the building’s load profile. Normalized revenue estimates are independent of the power capacity of the battery holding other performance characteristics equal, which can be used to calculate the profit-maximizing storage size. Chapter 5 analyzes the economic feasibility of flow batteries in the commercial and industrial market. Flow batteries at a 4-hour duration must be less expensive on a dollar per installed kWh basis, often by 20-30%, to break even with shorter duration li-ion or lead-acid despite allowing for deeper depth of discharge and superior cycle life. These results are robust to assumptions of tariff rates, battery round-trip efficiencies, amount of solar generation and whether the battery can participate in the wholesale energy and ancillary services markets.",12/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Integrating Demand-Side Resources into the Electric Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720245.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this thesis I quantify the cost of variability of different renewable energy technologies and then explore the use of reconfigurable distribution grids and pumped hydro electricity storage to integrate renewable energy into the electricity grid. Cost of Variability I calculate the cost of variability of solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, and wind by summing the costs of ancillary services and the energy required to compensate for variability and intermittency. I also calculate the cost of variability per unit of displaced CO2 emissions. The costs of variability are dependent on technology type. Variability cost for solar PV is $8-11/MWh, for solar thermal it is $5/MWh, and for wind it is around $4/MWh. Variability adds ~$15/tonne CO2 to the cost of abatement for solar thermal power, $25 for wind, and $33-$40 for PV. Distribution Grid Reconfiguration A reconfigurable network can change its topology by opening and closing switches on power lines. I show that reconfiguration allows a grid operator to reduce operational losses as well as accept more intermittent renewable generation than a static configuration can. Net present value analysis of automated switch technology shows that the return on investment is negative for this test network when considering loss reduction, but that the return is positive under certain conditions when reconfiguration is used to minimize curtailment of a renewable energy resource. Pumped Hydro Storage in Portugal Portugal is planning to build five new pumped hydro storage facilities to balance its growing wind capacity. I calculate the arbitrage potential of the storage capacity from the perspective of an independent storage owner, a thermal fleet owner, and a consumer-oriented storage owner. This research quantifies the effect storage ownership has on CO2 emissions, consumer electricity expenditure, and thermal generator profits. I find that in the Portuguese electricity market, an independent storage owner could not recoup its investment in storage using arbitrage only, but a thermal fleet owner or consumer-oriented owner may get a positive return on investment",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Integrating Variable Renewables into the Electric Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720257.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It looks at how incumbents and recent entrants benefit from hiring inventors by analyzing geographical mobility patterns, the determinants of inventor mobility, and the types of learning that results from hiring. The analysis is based on data on the origins of all semiconductor producers with larger sales, and on patent filings and patent citations. Three papers comprise the dissertation. The first paper argues that the higher mobility of inventors in Silicon Valley can be explained mostly through the rate of spinoff entry in the region. The empirical evidence shows that inventor mobility was high in Silicon Valley since spinoffs started entering in large numbers, which happened before the industry clustered there. Agglomeration economies and the ban of non-compete covenants can facilitate the continued entry of spinoffs, but they cannot explain the initial wave of entry. Further evidence of the effect of entry on mobility rates is provided by spinoffs outside of Silicon Valley, which also hire many inventors from their parents and other local firms. The second paper identifies and tests several drivers of worker turnover associated with matching and learning. Incumbents, recent entrants, and spinoffs have different goals when hiring experienced inventors. Incumbents hire many workers without prior patents, while younger firms hire mostly experienced inventors. For inventors hired by incumbents, the main determinant is matching. Instead, movements from parent to spinoffs seem to be motivated by the acquisition of knowledge from the parent. None of the drivers previously identified seem to apply to recent entrants. The last paper analyzes the effect of hiring experienced inventors on the citations made by the hiring firm. In movements to incumbents, or from parent to spinoffs, there is an increase in citations from the hiring to the origin firm. However, movements to recent entrants are associated with increases in citations to other firms. This is related to what firms learn from hiring. While incumbents and spinoff access firm specific knowledge from moving inventors, recent entrants seem to be more concerned with the knowledge about the industry that the inventor possesses.",8/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,"Inventor Mobility, Knowledge Spillovers and Spinoff Entry in the U.S. Semiconductor Industry",,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720284.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R63MEFBR,thesis,2017,"Roca, Jaime Bonnín",Leaders and Followers: Challenges and Opportunities in the Adoption of Metal Additive Manufacturing Technologies,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Leaders_and_Followers_Challenges_and_Opportunities_in_the_Adoption_of_Metal_Additive_Manufacturing_Technologies/6720371/1,"Policymakers in the United States and elsewhere have recognized that a broad and competitive manufacturing sector is crucial to a robust economy and that to remain competitive, a nation must invent and master new ways of making things. Moving technologies from laboratory to commercial success poses considerable challenges however. If the technology is radically new, this transition can be so risky and investment-heavy that only very large private firms can attempt it. One such new technology is metal additive manufacturing (MAM). MAM provides a vivid illustration of the tensions policymakers must resolve in simultaneously supporting the commercialization of early-stage innovations of strategic national interest, while fulfilling the government’s duty to ensure human health and safety. After an initial chapter with a general overview of additive manufacturing technologies, this dissertation explores these tensions from the perspective of two very different industrial contexts: the U.S. as a technology leader and trailblazer in the development of the technology, and Portugal as a technology follower with severely constrained resources. In the first case study, I use the extreme case of MAM (an emerging technology with many sources of process uncertainty) in commercial aviation (an industry where lapses in safety can have catastrophic consequences) to unpack how the characteristics of a technology may influence the options for regulatory intervention. Although my work focuses on the U.S. and the Federal Aviation Administration’s regulation, I expect this work to have an international scope, given that in most countries regulation is heavily influenced by, if not an exact copy of, the U.S. regulation. Based on my findings, I propose an adaptive regulatory framework in which standards are periodically revised and in which different groups of companies are regulated differently as a function of their technological capabilities. I conclude by proposing a generalizable framework for regulating emerging process-based technologies in safety-critical industries in which the optimal regulatory configuration depends on the industry structure (number of firms), the performance and safety requirements, and the sources of technological uncertainty. In the second case study, I analyze the adoption of polymer (PAM) and metal (MAM) additive manufacturing technologies in the Portuguese molds industry, both of which offer important benefits to their products. Leveraging archival data (related to the history of Portuguese institutions, and the development of additive manufacturing both globally and in Portugal), insights from 45 interviews across academia, industry, and government; and 75 hours of participant observations, we develop insights about why institutional instability affected the adoption of Polymer Additive Manufacturing (PAM) and Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) differently. In both cases, Portugal invested in the technology relatively early, and in the case of PAM the research community has been able to move towards high-tech applications. In contrast, the adoption of MAM has been modest despite its potential to greatly improve the performance and competitiveness of metal molds. From the comparison between PAM and MAM, we generate theory about which technological and contextual factors affect their ‘technological forgiveness’, defined as the resiliency of a new technology’s adoption to institutional instability. We conclude by proposing a generalizable framework for ‘forgiveness’ in different industrial contexts. The final chapter of this dissertation contains practical recommendations for regulators and managers interested in adopting the technology. Policymakers in the aviation industry may want to encourage the creation of programs to gather more flight experience with MAM parts. Small aircraft and other applications with higher risk tolerance than commercial aviation might represent more important channels to gather information, as the history of composite materials suggests. More importantly, regulators may need to introduce clauses in their rules to regulate MAM to avoid situations of ‘regulatory lock-in’ which could harm the long-term potential of the technology. Despite the potential of additive manufacturing, we believe that near-term expectations for it are overblown. In general, additive manufacturing holds great promise, but in many areas the cart has gotten ahead of the horse. Much of the technology is still under development. The history of comparable technologies such as composite materials and high-performance castings shows that the problems may take decades to resolve. For now, additive manufacturing is cost-competitive only in niche applications — for instance, those involving plastics. Businesses that want to plunge into additive manufacturing should be cognizant of the challenges. Determining whether it makes sense to invest in additive manufacturing will require experimentation and learning.",12/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Leaders and Followers,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720371.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The papers address a number of issues related to the operation and design of CCS-equipped plants with solvent storage and bypass, the effect of Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) on cycling of coal-fired power plants, and the EPA’s proposed CO2 emissions rule for existing power plants. In Chapter 2, I present results from a study of the design and operation of power plants equipped with CCS with flue gas bypass and solvent storage. I considered whether flue gas bypass and solvent storage could be used to increase the profitability of plants with CCS. Using a pricetaker profit maximization model, I evaluated the increase in NPV at a pulverized coal (PC) plant with an amine-based capture system, a PC plant with an ammonia-based capture system, and a natural gas combined-cycle plant with an amine-based capture system when these plants were equipped with an optimally sized solvent storage vessel and regenerator. I found that while flue gas bypass and solvent storage increased profitability at low CO2 prices, they ceased to do so at CO2 prices high enough for the overall plant to become NPV-positive. In Chapter 3, I present results from a Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch model of the PJM West power system. I quantify the increase in cycling of coal-fired power plants that results when complying with a 20% RPS using wind power, accounting for cycling costs not usually included in power plant bids. I find that while additional cycling does increase cycling-related production costs and emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOX, these increases are small compared to the overall reductions in production costs and air emissions that occur with high levels of wind. In proposing its existing power plant CO2 emissions standard, the Environmental Protection Agency determined that significant energy efficiency would be available to aid in compliance. In Chapter 4, I use an expanded version of the model of Chapter 3 to evaluate compliance with the standard with and without this energy efficiency, as well as under several other scenarios. I find that emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOX are relatively insensitive to the amount of energy efficiency available, but that production costs increase significantly when complying without efficiency. In complying with the EPA’s proposed existing power plant CO2 emissions standard, states will have the choice of whether to comply individually or in cooperation with other states, as well as the choice of whether to comply with a rate-based standard or a mass-based standard. In Chapter 5, I present results from a linear dispatch model of the power system in the continental U.S. I find that cooperative compliance reduces total costs, but that certain states will prefer not to cooperate. I also find that compliance with a mass-based standard increases electricity prices by a larger margin than does compliance with a rate-based standard, with implications for the distribution of surplus changes between producers and consumers.",2/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Low Carbon Policy and Technology in the Power Sector,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720458.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new detection tool called environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling, the collection and screening of water samples for the presence of the target species’ DNA, promises improved detection sensitivity compared to conventional surveillance methods. However, the application of eDNA sampling for invasive species management has been challenging due to the potential of false positives, from detecting species’ eDNA in the absence of live organisms. In this dissertation, I study the sources of error and uncertainty in eDNA sampling and develop statistical tools to show how eDNA sampling should be utilized for monitoring and managing invasive SC and BH in the United States. In chapter 2, I investigate the environmental and hydrologic variables, e.g. reverse flow, that may be contributing to positive eDNA sampling results upstream of the electric fish dispersal barrier in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), where live SC are not expected to be present. I used a beta-binomial regression model, which showed that reverse flow volume across the barrier has a statistically significant positive relationship with the probability of SC eDNA detection upstream of the barrier from 2009 to 2012 while other covariates, such as water temperature, season, chlorophyll concentration, do not. This is a potential alternative explanation for why SC eDNA has been detected upstream of the barrier but intact SC have not. In chapter 3, I develop and parameterize a statistical model to evaluate how changes made to the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)’s eDNA sampling protocols for invasive BH and SC monitoring from 2013 to 2015 have influenced their sensitivity. The model shows that changes to the protocol have caused the sensitivity to fluctuate. Overall, when assuming that eDNA is randomly distributed, the sensitivity of the current protocol is higher for BH eDNA detection and similar for SC eDNA detection compared to the original protocol used from 2009-2012. When assuming that eDNA is clumped, the sensitivity of the current protocol is slightly higher for BH eDNA detection but worse for SC eDNA detection. In chapter 4, I apply the model developed in chapter 3 to estimate the BH and SC eDNA concentration distributions in two pools of the Illinois River where BH and SC are considered to be present, one pool where they are absent, and upstream of the electric barrier in the CAWS given eDNA sampling data and knowledge of the eDNA sampling protocol used in 2014. The results show that the estimated mean eDNA concentrations in the Illinois River are highest in the invaded pools (La Grange; Marseilles) and are lower in the uninvaded pool (Brandon Road). The estimated eDNA concentrations in the CAWS are much lower compared to the concentrations in the Marseilles pool, which indicates that the few eDNA detections in the CAWS (3% of samples positive for SC and 0.4% samples positive for BH) do not signal the presence of live BH or SC. The model shows that >50% samples positive for BH or SC eDNA are needed to infer AC presence in the CAWS, i.e., that the estimated concentrations are similar to what is found in the Marseilles pool. Finally, in chapter 5, I develop a decision tree model to evaluate the value of information that monitoring provides for making decisions about BH and SC prevention strategies near the Great Lakes. The optimal prevention strategy is dependent on prior beliefs about the expected damage of AC invasion, the probability of invasion, and whether or not BH and SC have already invaded the Great Lakes (which is informed by monitoring). Given no monitoring, the optimal strategy is to stay with the status quo of operating electric barriers in the CAWS for low probabilities of invasion and low expected invasion costs. However, if the probability of invasion is greater than 30% and the cost of invasion is greater than $100 million a year, the optimal strategy changes to installing an additional barrier in the Brandon Road pool. Greater risk-aversion (i.e., aversion to monetary losses) causes less prevention (e.g., status quo instead of additional barriers) to be preferred. Given monitoring, the model shows that monitoring provides value for making this decision, only if the monitoring tool has perfect specificity (false positive rate = 0%).",5/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Making Sense of the Noise,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720470.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WGX9UQ6I,thesis,2012,"Mauch, Brandon Keith",Managing Wind Power Forecast Uncertainty in Electric Grids,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Managing_Wind_Power_Forecast_Uncertainty_in_Electric_Grids/6720479/1,"Electricity generated from wind power is both variable and uncertain. Wind forecasts provide valuable information for wind farm management, but they are not perfect. Chapter 2 presents a model of a wind farm with compressed air energy storage (CAES) participating freely in the day-ahead electricity market without the benefit of a renewable portfolio standard or production tax credit. CAES is used to reduce the risk of committing uncertain quantities of wind energy and to shift dispatch of wind generation to high price periods. Using wind forecast data and market prices from 2006 – 2009, we find that the annual income for the modeled wind-CAES system would not cover annualized capital costs. We also estimate market prices with a carbon price of $20 and $50 per tonne CO2 and find that the revenue would still not cover the capital costs. The implied cost per tonne of avoided CO2 to make a wind-CAES profitable from trading on the day-ahead market is roughly $100, with large variability due to electric power prices. Wind power forecast errors for aggregated wind farms are often modeled with Gaussian distributions. However, data from several studies have shown this to be inaccurate. Further, the distribution of wind power forecast errors largely depends on the wind power forecast value. The few papers that account for this dependence bin the wind forecast data and fit parametric distributions to the actual wind power in each bin. A method to model wind power forecast uncertainty as a single closed-form solution using a logit transformation of historical wind power forecast and actual wind power data is presented in Chapter 3. Once transformed, the data become close to jointly normally distributed. We show the process of calculating confidence intervals for wind power forecast errors using the jointly normally distributed logit transformed data. This method has the advantage of fitting the entire dataset with five parameters while also providing the ability to make calculations conditioned on the value of the wind power forecast. The model present in Chapter 3 is applied in Chapter 4 to calculate increases in net load uncertainty introduced from day-ahead wind power forecasts. Our analyses uses data from two different electric grids in the U.S. having similar levels of installed wind capacity with large differences in wind and load forecast accuracy due to geographic characteristics. A probabilistic method to calculate the dispatchable generation capacity required to balance day-ahead wind and load forecast errors for a given level of reliability is presented. Using empirical data we show that the capacity requirements for 95% day-ahead reliability range from 2100 MW to 5600 MW for ERCOT and 1900 MW to 4500 MW for MISO, depending on the amount of wind and load forecast for the next day. We briefly discuss the additional requirements for higher reliability levels and the effect of correlated wind and load forecast errors. Additionally, we show that each MW of additional wind power capacity in ERCOT must be matched by a 0.30 MW day-ahead dispatchable generation capacity to cover 95% of day-ahead uncertainty. Due to the lower wind forecast uncertainty in MISO, the value drops to 0.13 MW of dispatchable capacity for each MW of additional wind capacity. Direct load control (DLC) has received a lot of attention lately as an enabler of wind power. One major benefit of DLC is the added flexibility it brings to the grid. Utilities in some parts of the U.S. can bid the load reduction from DLC into energy markets. Forecasts of the resource available for DLC assist in determining load reduction quantities to offer. In Chapter 5, we present a censored regression model to forecast load from residential air conditioners using historical load data, hour of the day, and ambient temperature. We tested the forecast model with hourly data from 467 air conditioners located in three different utilities. We used two months of data to train the model and then ran day-ahead forecasts over a six week period. Mean square errors ranged from 4% to 8% of mean air conditioner load. This method produced accurate forecasts with much lower data requirements than physics based forecast models.",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720479.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, the transactive energy market framework has emerged as the key framework for future electricity market design in the electricity grid. However, most of the work done in this area has focused on developing retail level transactive energy markets. There seems to be an underlying assumption that wholesale electricity markets are ready to support any retail market design. In this dissertation, we focus on designing wholesale electricity markets that can better support transactive retail market. On the highest level, this dissertation contributes towards developing tools and models for future electricity market designs. A particular focus is placed on the relationship between wholesale markets and investment planning. Part I of this dissertation uses relatively simple models and case studies to evaluate key impediments to flexible transmission operation. In doing so, we identify several potential areas of concern in wholesale market designs: 1. There is a lack of consideration of demand flexibility both in the long-run and in the short-run 2. There is a disconnect between operational practices and investment planning 3. There is a need to rethink forward markets to better manage resource adequacy under long-term uncertainties 4. There is a need for more robust modeling tools for wholesale market design In Part II and Part III of this dissertation, we make use of mathematical decomposition and agent-based simulations to tackle these concerns. Part II of this dissertation uses Benders Decomposition and Lagrangian Decomposition to spatially and temporally decompose a power system and operation problem with active participation of flexible loads. In doing so, we are able to not only improve the computational efficiency of the problem, but also gain various insights on market structure and pricing. In particular, the decomposition suggests the need for a coordinated investment market and forward energy market to bridge the disconnect between operational practices and investment planning. Part III of this dissertation combines agent-based modeling with state-machine based modeling to test various spot, forward, and investment market designs, including the coordinated investment market and forward energy market proposed in Part II of this dissertation. In addition, we test a forward energy market design where 75% of load is required to be purchased in a 2-year-ahead forward market and various transmission cost recovery strategies. We demonstrate how the different market designs result in different investment decisions, winners, and losers. The market insights lead to further policy recommendations and open questions. Overall, this dissertation takes initial steps towards demonstrating how mathematical decomposition and agent-based simulations can be used as part of a larger market design toolbox to gain insights into different market designs and rules for the future electricity grid. In addition, this dissertation identifies market design ideas for further studies, particularly in the design of forward markets and investment cost recovery mechanisms.",4/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:57,5/20/25 15:22,,,,,,,Market Design for the Future Electricity Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720491.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/5HCJXTUE/Tee - 2017 - Market Design for the Future Electricity Grid Modeling Tools and Investment Case Studies.pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation provides a normative, descriptive, and prescriptive analysis of the design of such measures. Part I analyzes the normative foundations of the preference aggregation procedures that define societal preferences, concluding that conventional procedures represent a small subset of those that would be normatively permissible given conventional assumptions. Each aggregation procedure represents different ethical principles, reflecting differences in the treatment of preference heterogeneity, and Part I presents an analytical-deliberative framework for choosing among them. Part II describes the creation of a new HRQL measure, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Preference (PROPr) Scoring System. The PROPr Scoring System is a free, open-source tool that combines best practices in health profile measurement with those for creating preference-based scores. It is designed for integration with the PROMIS initiative of the National Institutes of Health, which is poised to become the U.S. standard for patient-reported outcomes. Part III characterizes the empirical relationships between exclusion criteria – meant to capture the data from preference surveys that are not true preferences – and the implications for those who choose to implement them. We show that conventions for data cleaning via exclusion criteria represent disparate mechanisms for exclusion, that exclusions impact the preference data available for analyses, and that exclusion likely affects the societal representativeness of the included preferences. We argue that there is sufficient empirical evidence to recommend only a subset of criteria, and describe procedures for implementing them in order to minimize wrongful exclusion. We outline future work to produce criteria with better classification properties and surveys that minimize the need for exclusion.",12/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Measurement of Health-Related Quality of Life,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720527.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Private sector participation in electrification is essential to meeting electricity access targets. Policy makers have acknowledged that grid extension in many remote rural areas is not as cost effective as decentralized alternatives such as microgrids. Microgrid companies have been unable to scale beyond pilot projects due in part to challenges in raising capital for a business model that is perceived to be risky. This thesis aims to identify and quantify the primary sources of investment risk in microgrid utilities and study ways to mitigate these risks to make these businesses more viable. Two modeling tools have been developed to this end. The Stochastic Techno-Economic Microgrid Model (STEMM) models the technical and financial performance of microgrid utilities using uncertain and dynamic inputs to permit explicit modeling of financial risk. This model is applied in an investment risk assessment and case study in Rwanda. Key findings suggest that the most important drivers of risk are fuel prices, foreign exchange rates, demand for electricity, and price elasticity of demand for electricity. The relative importance of these factors is technology dependent with demand uncertainty figuring stronger for solar and high solar penetration hybrid systems and fuel prices driving risk in diesel power and low solar penetration hybrid systems. Considering uncertainty in system sizing presents a tradeoff whereby a decrease in expected equity return decreases downside risk. High solar penetration systems are also found to be more attractive to lenders. The second modeling tool leverages electricity consumption and demographic data from four microgrids in Tanzania to forecast demand for electricity in newly electrified communities. Using statistical learning techniques, improvements in prediction performance was achieved over the historical mean baseline. I have also identified important predictors in estimating electricity consumption of newly connected customers. These include tariff structures and prices, preconnection sources of electricity and lighting, levels of spending on electricity services and airtime, and pre-connection appliance ownership.

Access to electricity is essential to eradicating energy poverty and empowering individuals, communities and economies, to reach their potential. Globally, 1.3 billion people, mainly in less developed countries, lack access to electricity. While central grid extension often provides electricity at very low cost, the reliability of the central grid in less developed countries is so low that the priority given by policy makers to central grid extension must be questioned. Rather than maximizing the extent of often unreliable or simply unenergized central grid extensions, we demonstrate the imperative to consider a multi-track approach to electricity access that includes microgrids and high quality solar lighting products. Through case studies and modeling efforts based on extensive empirical data, we provide new insight to this imperative and elucidate the nature of the challenges and solutions for microgrids to eradicate energy poverty.",12/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Microgrids and High - Quality Central Grid Alternatives,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720587.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This information may pose privacy and security risks to the smartphone user. The risks may vary from government surveillance to theft of financial information. Previous work in the area of smartphone privacy and security has both identified specific security flaws and examined users’ expectations and behaviors. However, there has not been a broad examination of the smartphone ecosystem to determine the risks to users from smartphone data sharing and the possible mitigations. Two of the five studies in this work examine the smartphone data sharing ecosystem to identify risks and mitigations. The first study uses multi-stakeholder expert interviews to identify risks to users and the mitigations. A second study examines app developers in order to quantify the risky behaviors and identify opportunities to improve security and privacy. In the remaining three of five studies discussed in this work, we examine one specific risk mitigation that has been popular with policy-makers: privacy notices for consumers. If done well, privacy notices should inform smartphone users about the risks and allow them to make informed decisions about data collection. Unfortunately, previous research has found that existing privacy notices do not help smartphone users, as they are neither noticed nor understood. Through user studies, we evaluate options to improve notices. We identify opportunities to capture the attention of users and improve understanding by examining the timing and content of notices. Overall, this work attempts to inform public policy around smartphone privacy and security. We find novel opportunities to mitigate risks by understanding app developers’ work and behaviors. Also, recognizing the current focus on privacy notices, we attempt to frame the debate by examining how users’ attention to and comprehension of notices can be improved through content and timing.",9/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Mitigating the Risks of Smartphone Data Sharing,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720635.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), defined as the aerosol mass arising from the oxidation products of gas-phase organic species, accounts for a significant fraction of the submicron atmospheric aerosol mass. Yet, there are large uncertainties surrounding the sources, atmospheric evolution and properties of SOA. This thesis combines laboratory experiments, extensive data analysis and global modeling to investigate the contribution of semi-volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds (SVOC and IVOC) from combustion sources to SOA formation. The goals are to quantify the contribution of these emissions to ambient PM and to evaluate and improve models to simulate its formation. To create a database for model development and evaluation, a series of smog chamber experiments were conducted on evaporated fuel, which served as surrogates for real-world combustion emissions. Diesel formed the most SOA followed by conventional jet fuel / jet fuel derived from natural gas, gasoline and jet fuel derived from coal. The variability in SOA formation from actual combustion emissions can be partially explained by the composition of the fuel. Several models were developed and tested along with existing models using SOA data from smog chamber experiments conducted using evaporated fuel (this work, gasoline, fischertropschs, jet fuel, diesels) and published data on dilute combustion emissions (aircraft, on- and off-road gasoline, on- and off-road diesel, wood burning, biomass burning). For all of the SOA data, existing models under-predicted SOA formation if SVOC/IVOC were not included. For the evaporated fuel experiments, when SVOC/IVOC were included predictions using the existing SOA model were brought to within a factor of two of measurements with minor adjustments to model parameterizations. Further, a volatility-only model suggested that differences in the volatility of the precursors were able to explain most of the variability observed in the SOA formation. For aircraft exhaust, the previous methods to simulate SOA formation from SVOC and IVOC performed poorly. A more physically-realistic modeling framework was developed, which was then used to show that SOA formation from aircraft exhaust was (a) higher for petroleumbased than synthetically derived jet fuel and (b) higher at lower engine loads and vice versa. All of the SOA data from combustion emissions experiments were used to determine source-specific parameterizations to model SOA formation from SVOC, IVOC and other unspeciated emissions. The new parameterizations were used to investigate their influence on the OA budget in the United States. Combustion sources were estimated to emit about 2.61 Tg yr-1 of SVOC, IVOC and other unspeciated emissions (sixth of the total anthropogenic organic emissions), which are predicted to double SOA production from combustion sources in the United States. The contribution of SVOC and IVOC emissions to global SOA formation was assessed using a global climate model. Simulations were performed using a modified version of GISS GCM II’. The modified model predicted that SVOC and IVOC contributed to half of the OA mass in the atmosphere. Their inclusion improved OA model-measurement comparisons for absolute concentrations, POA-SOA split and volatility (gas-particle partitioning) globally suggesting that atmospheric models need to incorporate SOA formation from SVOC and IVOC if they are to reasonably predict the abundance and properties of aerosols. This thesis demonstrates that SVOC/IVOC and possibly other unspeciated organics emitted by combustion sources are very important precursors of SOA and potentially large contributors to the atmospheric aerosol mass. Models used for research and policy applications need to represent them to improve model-predictions of aerosols on climate and health outcomes. The improved modeling frameworks developed in this dissertation are suitable for implementation into chemical transport models.",8/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720698.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For nearly a decade, researchers have struggled with the question of how to model nanoparticles (NPs), an emerging class of environmental contaminants whose behavior in surface waters and sediments is controlled by complex interactions between particle properties and environmental factors. Population balance models, which track the size distribution of a particle population as it changes due to physicochemical processes, are a promising alternative to classical mass balance models that only track the total NP mass. However, the strengths and weaknesses of different population balance methods have not yet been explored in-depth for NPs. This work introduces three projects that, together, (1) probe the influence of spatiotemporal variation in environmental conditions on NP fate, (2) investigate the influence of common simplifying assumptions on model predictions, and (3) explore population balance for problems of NP dissolution and aggregation in water. Focus is placed on spherical metal and metal oxide NPs. Chapter 1 reviews past and current approaches in NP fate modeling, highlights key challenges, and frames the scope and objectives of this work. Chapter 2 presents a sediment diagenesis model that explores the influence of organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, and naturally-occurring sulfides on the distribution and speciation of antibacterial silver NPs and their reaction by-products in freshwater sediments. Chapter 3 presents a coupled hydrologic, agricultural, and water quality model that predicts silver and zinc oxide NP fate in a freshwater watershed under spatiotemporally variable environmental conditions. This basin-scale model reveals the unintended consequences of simplifying assumptions commonly used in largescale fate models of NPs. Chapter 4 compares alternative population balance modeling frameworks that vary with respect to runtimes, accuracy, and extensibility to environmentally relevant systems and complex particle types. Chapter 5 summarizes key findings and identifies high-priority research vii areas for experimentalists and modelers interested in the development of next-generation models with greater relevance for scientific investigations at the laboratory scale as well as risk management and regulation at the river or watershed scale.",5/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Modeling the Fate of Engineered Metal and Metal Oxide Nanoparticles in Surface W aters and Sediments,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720710.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
X5VW7HRG,thesis,2016,"Lamy, Julian","Optimal Locations for Siting Wind Energy Projects: Technical Challenges, Economics, and Public Preferences",,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Optimal_Locations_for_Siting_Wind_Energy_Projects_Technical_Challenges_Economics_and_Public_Preferences/6724454/1,"Increasing the percentage of wind power in the United States electricity generation mix would facilitate the transition towards a more sustainable, low-pollution, and environmentally-conscious electricity grid. However, this effort is not without cost. Wind power generation is time-variable and typically not synchronized with electricity demand (i.e., load). In addition, the highest-output wind resources are often located in remote locations, necessitating transmission investment between generation sites and load. Furthermore, negative public perceptions of wind projects could prevent widespread wind development, especially for projects close to densely-populated communities. The work presented in my dissertation seeks to understand where it’s best to locate wind energy projects while considering these various factors. First, in Chapter 2, I examine whether energy storage technologies, such as grid-scale batteries, could help reduce the transmission upgrade costs incurred when siting wind projects in distant locations. For a case study of a hypothetical 200 MW wind project in North Dakota that delivers power to Illinois, I present an optimization model that estimates the optimal size of transmission and energy storage capacity that yields the lowest average cost of generation and transmission ($/MWh). I find that for this application of storage to be economical, energy storage costs would have to be $100/kWh or lower, which is well below current costs for available technologies. I conclude that there are likely better ways to use energy storage than for accessing distant wind projects. Following from this work, in Chapter 3, I present an optimization model to estimate the economics of accessing high quality wind resources in remote areas to comply with renewable energy policy targets. I include temporal aspects of wind power (variability costs and correlation to market prices) as well as total wind power produced from different farms. I assess the goal of providing 40 TWh of new wind generation in the Midwestern transmission system (MISO) while minimizing system costs. Results show that building wind farms in North/South Dakota (windiest states) compared to Illinois (less windy, but close to population centers) would only be economical if the incremental transmission costs to access them were below $360/kW of wind capacity (break-even value). Historically, the incremental transmission costs for wind development in North/South Dakota compared to in Illinois are about twice this value. However, the break-even incremental transmission cost for wind farms in Minnesota/Iowa (also windy states) is $250/kW, which is consistent with historical costs. I conclude that for the case in MISO, building wind projects in more distant locations (i.e., Minnesota/Iowa) is most economical. My two final chapters use semi-structured interviews (Chapter 4) and conjoint-based surveys (Chapter 5) to understand public perceptions and preferences for different wind project siting characteristics such as the distance between the project and a person’s home (i.e., “not-in-my-backyard” or NIMBY) and offshore vs. onshore locations. The semi-structured interviews, conducted with members of a community in Massachusetts, revealed that economic benefit to the community is the most important factor driving perceptions about projects, along with aesthetics, noise impacts, environmental benefits, hazard to wildlife, and safety concerns. In Chapter 5, I show the results from the conjoint survey. The study’s sample included participants from a coastal community in Massachusetts and a U.S.-wide sample from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Results show that participants in the U.S.-wide sample perceived a small reduction in utility, equivalent to $1 per month, for living within 1 mile of a project. Surprisingly, I find no evidence of this effect for participants in the coastal community. The most important characteristic to both samples was the economic benefits from the project – both to their community through increased tax revenue, and to individuals through reduced monthly energy bills. Further, participants in both samples preferred onshore to offshore projects, but that preference was much stronger in the coastal community. I also find that participants from the coastal community preferred expanding an existing wind projects rather than building an entirely new one, whereas those in the U.S.-wide sample were indifferent, and equally supportive of the two options. These differences are likely driven by the prior positive experience the coastal community has had with an existing onshore wind project as well as their strong cultural identity that favors ocean views. I conclude that preference for increased distance from a wind project (NIMBY) is likely small or non-existent and that offshore wind projects within 5 miles from shore could cause large welfare losses to coastal communities. Finally, in Chapter 6, I provide a discussion and policy recommendations from my work. Importantly, I recommend that future research should combine the various topics throughout my chapters (i.e., transmission requirements, hourly power production, variability impacts to the grid, and public preferences) into a comprehensive model that identifies optimal locations for wind projects across the United States.",12/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,Optimal Locations for Siting Wind Energy Projects,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6724454.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation investigates battery degradation, and how the introduction of PHEVs may influence the electricity grid, emissions, and petroleum use in the US. It examines the effects of combined driving and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) usage on the lifetime performance of relevant commercial Li-ion cells. The loss of battery capacity was quantified as a function of driving days as well as a function of integrated capacity and energy processed by the cells. The cells tested showed promising capacity fade performance: more than 95% of the original cell capacity remains after thousands of driving days worth of use. Statistical analyses indicate that rapid vehicle motive cycling degraded the cells more than slower, V2G galvanostatic cycling. These data are used to examine the potential economic implications of using vehicle batteries to store grid electricity generated at off-peak hours for off-vehicle use during peak hours. The maximum annual profit with perfect market information and no battery degradation cost ranged from ∼US$140 to $250 in the three cities. If the measured battery degradation is applied, however, the maximum annual profit decreases to ∼$10–120. The dissertation details the increase in electric grid load and emissions due to vehicle battery charging in PJM and NYISO with the current generation mix, the current mix with a $50/tonne CO2 price, and this case but with existing coal generators retrofitted with 80% CO2 capture. It also models emissions using natural gas or wind+gas. PHEV fleet percentages between 0.4 and 50% are examined. When compared to 2020 CAFE standards, net CO2 emissions in New York are reduced by switching from gasoline to electricity; coal-heavy PJM shows somewhat smaller benefits unless coal units are fitted with CCS or replaced with lower CO2 generation. NOX is reduced in both RTOs, but there is upward pressure on SO2 emissions or allowance prices under a cap. Finally the dissertation compares increasing the all-electric range (AER) of PHEVs to installing charging infrastructure. Fuel use was modeled using the National Household Travel Survey and Greenhouse Gasses, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation model. It was found that increasing AER of plug-in hybrids was a more cost effective solution to reducing gasoline consumption than installing charging infrastructure. Comparison of results to current subsidy structure shows various options to improve future PHEV or other vehicle subsidy programs.",5/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:29,,,,,,,Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721085.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The energy consumption of ICT in general and data centers in particular has been of growing interest to both industry and the public, with continued calls for increased efficiency and greater focus on environmental impacts. The first study examines the metrics used to assess data center energy performance and finds that power usage effectiveness (PUE), the de facto industry standard, only accounts for one of four critical aspects of data center energy performance. PUE measures the overhead of the facility infrastructure but does not consider the efficiency of the IT equipment, its utilization, or the emissions profile of the power source. As a result, PUE corresponds poorly with energy and carbon efficiency, as demonstrated using a small set of empirical data center energy use measurements. The second study lays out a taxonomy of indirect energy impacts to help assess whether ICT’s direct energy consumption is offset by its energy benefits, and concludes that ICT likely has a large potential net energy benefit, but that there is no consensus on the sign or magnitude of actual savings, which are largely dependent upon implementation details. The third study estimates the potential of dynamic load shifting in a content distribution network to reduce both private costs and emissions-related externalities associated with electricity consumption. Utilizing variable marginal retail prices based on wholesale electricity markets and marginal damages estimated from emissions data in a cost-minimization model, the analysis finds that load shifting can either reduce data center power bills by approximately 25%–33% or avoid 30%–40% of public damages, while a range of joint cost minimization strategies enables simultaneous reduction of both private and public costs. The vast majority of these savings can be achieved even under existing bandwidth and network distance constraints, although current industry trends towards virtualization, energy efficiency, and green powermay make load shifting less appealing.",8/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:29,,,,,,,Powering the Information Age,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721103.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, individuals are heterogeneous in both what they want or their preference content, and whether they know what they want or their preference structure. Prior work typically restricts preference heterogeneity analysis to differences in preference content.

We present a general framework for analyzing and discoveringpreference content and structure from choice data. Our framework extends welfare measurementto fully account for preference heterogeneity and can help to better understand the welfare impacts of new policies for sub-populations. As heterogeneity in preference canbe related to judgment structure, we first study how heterogeneity in preference content is related to heuristic judgment. We establish the relationship between judgment and choice for cumulative flood risks. Second, we propose a model that can directly determine differencesin both preference content and structure for individual decision makers empirically using graph matching methods. Finally, we measure heterogeneity in preference content across sub-populations. We develop and test a method to uncover relevant sub-populations in a choice model automatically using machine learning tools. We illustrate the approach discovering relevant socioeconomic covariates in a recent and real decision facing the Chilean government about the environmental impacts of electricity generation.

This approach relies on the assumption that users provided with notice will make informed choices that align with their privacy expectations. The goal of this research is to empirically inform industry and regulatory efforts that rely on notice and choice to protect people’s online privacy. To do so, we present a set of case studies covering different aspects of privacy notice and choice in four domains: online behavioral advertising (OBA), online social networks (OSN), financial privacy notices, and websites’ machine-readable privacy notices. We investigate users’ privacy preferences, information needs, and ability to exercise choices in the OBAdomain. Based on our results, we provide recommendations to improve the design of notice and choice methods currently in use in this domain. In the context of OSNs, we explore the effect of nudging notices designed to encourage more thoughtful disclosures among Facebook users and recommend changes to the Facebook user interface aimed to mitigate problematic disclosures. We demonstrate how standardized notices enable large-scale evaluations and comparisons of companies’ privacy practices and argue that standardized privacy notices have an enormous potential to improve transparency and benefit users, privacy-respectful companies, and oversight entities. We argue that, in today’s complex Internet ecosystem, an approach that relies on users to make privacy decisions should also empower them with user-friendly interfaces, relevant information, and the tools they need to make privacy decisions.

The feasibility of this strategy will partially depend on public acceptance of these technologies as part of a national energy policy. To varying degrees, public misconceptions and knowledge gaps exist for each of these low-carbon technologies. Thus, people need balanced and comparative information to make informed decisions about which low-carbon electricity technologies and portfolios to support. In this thesis, we describe paper-based and computer-based communications presenting multi-attribute descriptions about the costs, benefits, risks and limitations of ten electricity technologies and low-carbon portfolios composed of those technologies. Participants are first asked to rank the technologies under a hypothetical scenario where future power plant construction in Pennsylvania must meet a CO2 emissions constraint. Next, participants attend small group meetings where they rank seven portfolios that meet a specific CO2 emission limit. In a subsequent study, participants instead construct their own low-carbon portfolio using a computer decision tool that restricts portfolio designs to realistic technology combinations. We find that our participants could understand and consistently use our communications to help inform their decisions about low-carbon technologies. We conclude that our informed participants preferred energy efficiency, nuclear, and coal (gasification) with CCS, as well as diverse portfolios including these technologies. The thesis continues with a retrospective view for the value of research that elicits general public opinions of CCS and that develops communications to educate people about low-carbon electricity generation. In the latter, we find that the knowledge of science teachers may be insufficient to correct common public misconceptions about low-carbon technologies among their students. Thus, the communications we developed for this thesis could also benefit science teachers.

This dissertation examines near future battery technology and cost by (1) validating existing physics-based battery performance models using laboratory testing and manufacturer specifications, (2) constructing battery design optimization and production cost models to identify the least-cost design and investigating how key design-decision variables affect performance and cost for a variety of vehicle power and energy requirements, and (3) conducting expert elicitation on future battery costs and the key factors that drive cost. The validation, cost, and optimization modeling work use LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2/LixC6 (NMC-G) as the chemistry of choice. Validation results of Battery Design Studio™ (BDS) a Li-ion battery modeling software indicated that BDS predictions of total energy delivered under our constant C-rate battery discharge tests are within 6.5% of laboratory measurements for a full discharge and within 2.8% when a 60% state of charge window is considered. Once validated, BDS is used to develop a power meta-model that predicts the 10–sec power capability of a cell design as a function of its capacity (Ah) and cathode coating thickness (microns). The production cost model is a process-based model and is constructed adopting process step information from existing literature. Subsequently, an optimization model is developed which estimates the cheapest cost battery pack design for a set of five different electrified vehicles (EVs) whereby the role of design-decision variables like cathode coating thickness is investigated among others. The energy and power requirements for the EVs, used as constraints in the optimization model, are calculated using the Powertrain Systems Analysis Toolkit (PSAT). Battery pack costs calculated are in the range of costs reported in the literature. Results indicate that higher capacity cells manufactured using higher electrode coating thicknesses can decrease manufacturing costs by 5-8%. Results suggest that economies of scale can be reached at a plant size of about 200MWh. Expert elicitation indicates that a variation of NMC-G is likely to be the cheaper cell-chemistry by 2018 with no major technological breakthroughs.

HLMG8IGJ,thesis,2016,"Abrahams, Leslie",Quantitative Modeling Under Uncertainty to Inform Effective Energy and Environmental Policies,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Quantitative_Modeling_Under_Uncertainty_to_Inform_Effective_Energy_and_Environmental_Policies/6721223/1,"Natural gas production in the United States has increased significantly over the past decade. This is largely due to advancements in hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, and seismic monitoring capabilities that have enabled extraction of natural gas from shale resources to be economically viable. While natural gas is an important global energy resource and may result in fewer emissions than coal for electricity generation, it is important to recognize that extraction of natural gas has the potential to cause local and regional environmental damages. Successfully managing these risks is critical in order to ensure natural gas consumption has a net positive environmental footprint. The second and third chapters of this dissertation use quantitative modeling to assess how policies can address and mitigate potential environmental impacts in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, this work focuses on minimizing incremental fragmentation in critical core forest ecosystems resulting from natural gas infrastructure and on managing wastewater byproducts from natural gas extraction. The second chapter finds that in the case study of a core forest region in Bradford County, Pennsylvania, the number of core patches of forest, an indicator of fragmentation, could as much as double throughout the life time of the Marcellus Shale play (from 80 to 160 core patches) without any regulatory intervention. However, through unitization and collaborative planning, and by designating that gathering pipelines must follow the route of pre-existing roads in forests whenever possible, natural gas infrastructure can be developed in a manner that would both prevent incremental fragmentation from occurring and reduce pipeline construction costs for operators as a result of reduced infrastructure redundancies. The third chapter finds that approximately 1.3 million gallons of wastewater, called produced water, are generated by each well. Across Pennsylvania, 67% of the time Class II disposal is the least cost option, 25% of the time CWT is the least cost option, and 8% of the time on-site treatment is the least cost option. The corresponding average costs are $5.80/bbl ($0.015/Mcf), $7.80/bbl ($0.020/Mcf), and $8.40/bbl ($0.021/Mcf), respectively. In addition to cost, however, there are several technical, ecological, regulatory, and logistical issues that also affect the relative feasibility of these three produced water management strategies. If regulators could capture producers willingness to pay to dispose of water rather than treat the water, that money could be invested in treating other water quality issues in Pennsylvania such as coal mine drainage, which can be treated for $0.064/bbl on average, or agricultural runoff, which could be prevented at an average cost of $0.08/bbl. The last two chapters in this dissertation explore how quantitative modeling can inform policy making on a national and global scale. Chapter 4 does this by characterizing the life cycle greenhouse gas impact of United States natural gas exports. This study finds that mean landed (pre-combustion) life cycle GHGs for exported U.S. LNG after regasification at the importing country were found to be 37 g CO2-equiv/MJ with a range of 27 to 50. The net global impact of these emissions depends on the global warming potential time scale, methane leakage rate, end use, and the fuel it displaces. On a 100 year time scale, life cycle emissions from exported LNG were found on average to be 655 g CO2-equiv/kWh for electricity generation, a 45% reduction over life cycle emissions from coal consumption. However, because of the spatial shift in emissions generation, although there is a global GHG benefit to US natural gas exports, the United States should consider the implications of this given that emissions calculations are based on CO2-eq emitted within a country’s borders rather than based on the net global impact of those emissions. The fifth chapter continues to explore international trade policy by focusing on the global crude trade as a case study. This chapter considers how shifting trade patterns can influence global costs and greenhouse gas emissions using a linear optimization model. The baseline 2014 crude trade system had a global cost of $3T and resulted in 16.5 Gt of CO2. Minimizing by cost would save $6T and increase emissions by 4 Gt CO2, while minimizing by emissions would increase cost by $0.5T and decrease emissions by 5.4 Gt. This chapter then explores the interaction between climate policies including carbon accounting methods, a designated global carbon cap, and unilateral country specific emissions allocations. There is a 40% higher allowable consumption under a strict global carbon cap without country-specific emissions allocations (1100 Mmt) than with country-specific emissions caps (770 Mmt). These results illustrate cooperative international climate policy could be more cost-effective in mitigating carbon emissions than countries acting individually.",4/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721223.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this thesis, I present analyses of four different aspects of this transition, with an emphasis on the PJM Interconnection. The effects of bulk electricity storage on the PJM market I analyze the value of three storage technologies in the PJM day-ahead energy market, using a reduced-form unit commitment model with 2010 data. I find that large-scale storage would increase overall social welfare in PJM. However, the annualized capital costs of storage would exceed social welfare gains. Consumers would save up to $4 billion annually, largely at the expense of generator surplus. Storage modestly increases emissions of CO2 and other pollutants. The external costs and benefits of wind energy in PJM Large deployments of wind create external costs and benefits that are not fully captured in power purchase agreements. I find that wind’s external costs in the PJM market are uncertain but significant when compared to levelized PPA prices. Pollution reduction benefits are very uncertain but exceed external costs with high probability. The climate and health effects of a USA switch from coal to gas electricity generation I analyze the emission benefits created by a hypothetical scenario in which all U.S. coal plants are switched to natural gas plants in 2016. The net effect on warming is unclear; results are highly sensitive to the rate of fugitive methane emissions and the efficiency of replacement gas plants. However, the human health benefits of such a switch are substantial. The costs of building and operating new gas plants likely exceed the health benefits. Robust resource adequacy planning in the face of coal retirements Over the next decade, many U.S. coal-fired power plants are expected to retire, posing a challenge to system planners. I investigate the resource adequacy requirements of the PJM Interconnection, and how procuring less capacity may affect reliability. I find that PJM’s 2010 reserve margin of 20.5% was sufficient to achieve the stated reliability standard with 90% confidence. PJM could reduce reserve margins to 13% and still achieve levels of reliability accepted by other power systems.",9/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Reducing Carbon Intensity in Restructured Markets,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721280.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both sectors also contribute to poor local and regional air quality. This thesis analyzes three interventions aimed at reducing air emissions from airplanes and ships. The first is the use of tugs, or an electric motor embedded in the landing gear, to propel the aircraft on the ground. If airlines were to tow all large narrowbody aircraft on domestic service from the gate to the edge of the runway before take off at 41 of the 50 busiest airports in the U.S., CO2 emissions would fall by 0.5 million tonnes annually. In addition, the switch would produce $150 million in annual air quality benefits from reduced emissions of particulate matter, hydrocarbons and the oxides of nitrogen. Using embedded electric motors to taxi large narrowbody aircraft would cut CO2 emissions by nearly 2 million tonnes per year. The second intervention is the market based mechanism, designed to cap CO2 emissions from international aviation at 2020 levels, currently being designed at ICAO. An analysis of an early draft of this mechanism suggests that it would require airlines to offset an average of 270 million tonnes in CO2 emissions during each of the years between 2021 and 2035 when it will be active. The analysis suggests that the current proposal is complex, and poorly specified. We recommend that the mechanism be made much simpler: for example, by simply determining an airline’s offset obligations on the basis of its carbon footprint in that year. Finally, we study the costs and benefits of a more widespread use of grid electricity to energize berthed vessels. We use mixed-integer linear programming to identify combinations of ports and vessels where using shore power would produce the greatest benefit to society. We conclude that the practice could reduce CO2 emissions by 0.2 million tonnes per year and yield air quality improvements worth $80-200 million per year at no net cost to society.",5/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721283.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Measurement campaigns can be costly, especially when the area of interest includes oceans, forests, agricultural regions or other dispersed spatial domains. Satellite based remote sensing offers a way to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of policy analysis concerning these systems. However, there are key limitations to the implementation of satellite data. Uncertainty in data derived from remote-sensing can be significant, and traditional methods of policy analysis for managing uncertainty on large datasets can be computationally expensive. Moreover, while satellite data can increasingly offer estimates of some parameters such as weather or crop use, other information regarding demographic or economic data is unlikely to be estimated using these techniques. Managing these challenges in practical policy analysis remains a challenge. In this dissertation, I conduct five case studies which rely heavily on data sourced from orbital sensors. First, I assess the magnitude of climate and anthropogenic stress on coral reef ecosystems. Second, I conduct an impact assessment of soil salinity on California agriculture. Third, I measure the propensity of growers to adapt their cropping practices to soil salinization in agriculture. Fourth, I analyze whether small-scale desalination units could be applied on farms in California in order mitigate the effects of drought and salinization as well as prevent agricultural drainage from entering vulnerable ecosystems. And fifth, I assess the feasibility of satellite-based remote sensing for salinity measurement at global scale.

There is much interest in improving our understanding of the nature, dynamics and impact of this cooperation in science. This thesis contributes to this area in three dimensions. First, it proposes a novel method by which one can characterize and assess research collaboration, which takes into consideration the self-organizing process of scientific collaboration. Second, building partially on the new method, it studies how research collaboration, in particular research groups and scientific stars, influence the nurturing of new researchers that enter a scientific system. Finally, it explores in detail what the new researchers look for, and find, in their early collaborations. The field of physics and related areas (including applied physics, material sciences and optics) in Mexico is used to look at these issues. The proposed evaluation method uses self-organizing characteristics of science to identify and compare relevant units of analysis. To characterize groups, the thesis exploits the patterns of collaboration and develops a method that identifies and benchmarks research groups. Collaboration patterns of researchers are used to identify the frontiers of the focal research units and the backward citation patterns are employed to establish relevant benchmark units for each focal unit. The results suggest that the definition of the unit of analysis affects our understanding of the position a research institutions has within the Science Technology and Innovation (ST&I) System and provides evidence that the performance of Mexican institutions in Physics is highly heterogeneous within institutions. This is important because research administrators and policy makers need to take into account this heterogeneity when assessing the ST&I system. The second contribution of this thesis is an investigation of how different forms of scientific collaboration early on in the career of a researcher relate to his or her future publication and citation rates, and their likelihood of becoming a leading scientist. In particular it quantifies the effect of collaborative research environments, such as prominent scientists or research groups (identified using the method developed in the thesis), on new scholars. This study shows that eminent scientists have an important role in the development of a scientific system (especially within the context of an emerging economy) in terms of publications and citations. In particular it finds that these stars have a positive and significant effect on the productivity and impact of young researchers, as well as on their likelihood of also becoming leading scientists. In addition, early collaboration with a highly productive research group and the leader of this group also contributes to superior productivity performance by scientists. Third, this thesis explores how budding scientists, some of which became highly accomplished researchers, used their collaborations with other top scientists and research groups early in their career. This works finds that researchers who later became star scientists focus on acquiring new ideas and knowledge through early interactions with other scientists, particularly foreign collaborators and existing stars, whereas those less prominent focus on accessing resources and only learning “basic” research kills, like publishing. Finally, this thesis provides important insights for policy makers by showing the significance research collaboration has in the development of ST&I of an emerging economy. In addition, this work highlights the importance of endogenously defining the unit of analysis and taking into account the heterogeneity within the system when making assessments of the ST&I system. Furthermore, this dissertation shows the relevance scientific stars surrounded by nurturing environments have in the progress of science, as well as the importance cooperation with these scientists and foreign collaboration has in exposing young faculty to new ideas.",5/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721322.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differentiated reliability services beyond the standard level utilize advanced metering infrastructure, automated distribution reconfiguration and distributed generation (DG). The service quality at the standard level is regulated, while high reliability services are offered through a market mechanism. This proposed market mechanism is designed in two different models of managing the distribution networks. The first model assumes that an independent distribution system operator (DSO) as an administrative firm provides operational support for delivery and reliability services in a retail market, while the second model does not have a DSO. Main reliability market participants are distribution utilities, retail electricity providers (REPs), non-utility-owned DG units, and end users. The REPs, as end users’ representatives and aggregators, purchase delivery service with high reliability level and backup power from the utilities and DG units, respectively. The prices for these services are based on bidding by all market participants. Bids are created by each market participant optimizing its objective with respect to its own interests; therefore, the market participant can assess the investment costs and manage its own risk in setting the service charge. Notably, the proposed market mechanism, which is based on knowing customers’ willingness to pay, and preferences for reliability, aims to give long-term investment signals to service providers for planning investments in new technologies at value. In addition, the provision of high reliability services can be considered a means that enables the service providers to improve system resilience. The modified IEEE Roy Billinton Test System Bus 2 is simulated to demonstrate proof-of-concept for the proposed retail market by showing the iii process of settling the service prices and utilities’ expected compensation design. By comparing the settled service prices between the two market models, we show that the service prices are quite similar, but the number of end users obtaining backup power is different.",12/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721334.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UGGF3AUN,thesis,2014,"Peña-Cabra, Ivonne Astrid",Retrospective and Prospective Analysis of Policy Incentives For Wind Power in Portugal,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Retrospective_and_Prospective_Analysis_of_Policy_Incentives_For_Wind_Power_in_Portugal/6721337/1,"Concerns over climate change impacts, goals to increase environmental sustainability, and questions about the reliability of fuel supply have led several countries to pursue the goal of increasing the share of renewable energy sources in their electricity grid. Portugal is one of the leading countries for wind electricity generation. Wind diffusion in Portugal started in the early 2000’s and in 2013 wind electricity generation accounted for more than 24% (REN 2013b). The large share of wind in Portuguese electricity production is a consequence of European Union (E.U.) mandates and national policies, mainly feed-in tariffs. Discussions on the appropriate policy design and level of incentive to promote renewable energy adoption and meet further renewable capacity goals are ongoing in Portugal, namely in what concerns the level and duration of feed-in tariffs that should be provided to independent power producers. This, in turn, raises the question of whether the past feed-in tariff levels were well designed to achieve the goals of a larger penetration of renewables in the Portuguese grid. The policies to induce wind adoption have led to a growth in wind installed capacity and share of electricity generated by wind in Portugal from less than 1% in 2000 to approximately 24% in 2013, but questions arise on their cost-effectiveness and whether alternative policy designs would have led to the same goal. vi The Portuguese wind feed-in tariffs are a guaranteed incentive which has varied between $85- $180/MWh over the last 20 years (ERSE 2011), and remained approximately constant since 2001 at $101/MWh. They are currently guaranteed for 20 years of production or 44GWh of electricity generation per MW installed (Diário da República 2013) - the longest period among countries with high wind electricity share. They do not incorporate any digression rate besides inflation, and are guaranteed for every unit of electricity fed to the grid. There are no power plants that have already been decommissioned despite being in operation for more than 20 years, favoring from new, detailed and hard-to-follow agreements in the legislation. All wind parks that are currently in operation have received feed-in tariffs since they connected to the grid, and are expected to keep receiving them at least until December 2019, and up to December 2036 - depending on year of connection and agreement under the most recent legislation (Diário da República 2013). The 2020 renewable energy goals in Portugal include having 6.8 GW of installed wind capacity, which implies the connection of 2 GW in the next years. If no further grid investments are made and wind capacity increases up to 100 MW to the connection point that we analyze, total annual electricity spill is likely to range the 20% to 40%. If the connection grid policy is designed to allow for wind spill, already ‘occupied’ connection points will be available to new entrants, lowering the total investment costs for new wind parks and increasing their profitability. This thesis is divided in three main parts: a first introductory section, a retrospective study of wind power in Portugal and a prospective analysis of the Portuguese wind power sector. The introductory section is a brief overview of the global renewable status, described in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 compile a retrospective study of wind power and the policies that have incentivized wind diffusion. We include in the discussion some references to the future wind vii power goals, but the results and policy recommendations are directed towards the existing connected wind power capacity. Chapter 2 is a qualitative piece that describes in detail the motivation behind the Portuguese wind power diffusion, the policy changes over the last 20 years and the mechanics of the remuneration mechanism, i.e. the feed-in tariff formula variables and the actors of the wind power sector. We compare the Portuguese feed-in tariff with other European feed-in tariff designs and conclude that the incentive is one of the highest in Europe, contributing to the current Portuguese electricity system deficit of about $2 billion. If feed-in tariffs keep being fixed and do not incorporate any market variation, and renewables are prioritized to meet electricity demand, feed-in tariff net support per unit of electricity might be higher when the wind blows the most because moments with high penetration of renewable power might be correlated with low market prices. We find that wind power penetration is correlated with net exports to Spain. This might result in a net cost to Portugal and a subsidy to Spanish electricity consumers per unit of electricity traded. In total terms, the resulting subsidy is higher when the wind resource is larger as well, as the total amount of electricity that is exported increases. In Chapter 3 we estimate the profits of wind power producers connected in Portugal between 1992 and 2010, and we recommend specific policy reforms that would lower spending in the form of wind feed-in tariffs. In particular, we assess four scenarios to decrease the level and/or period of the tariffs. We find that under the 2005 legislation - in which feed-in tariffs are granted for 15 years, all existing wind parks have positive NPVs varying between $0 and $12/MWh, when considering a 20-year lifetime. In fact, most of existing wind parks can stop receiving the feed-in tariff now (July 2014), and instead participate directly in the Iberian electricity market and still be profitable. Moreover, under the 2013 feed-in tariff reform that aims at decreasing the viii electricity system deficit, total spending will increase and wind parks will have larger profits than under the 2005 legislation. The motivation of keeping a high feed-in tariff comes from the need of liquidity that wind producers can provide immediately to the electricity system, which is required at this moment to comply with the E.U. economic agreements signed during the recession. Nevertheless, the environmental and energy dependency benefits of the Portuguese wind sector could have been achieved with as much as 25% less spending. Later on, we move to analyze future wind power additions. Chapter 4 compiles a prospective analysis of the wind power sector in Portugal. We focus on new wind parks that will connect to critical lines of the distribution grid in two regions of the country, as part of the national 2030 wind power goals. In particular, we assess the implications of a 100% guaranteed availability of grid power capacity. We find that from the investor perspective, it is more profitable to bear some risk of wind power curtailment, because of the avoided costs that would otherwise be incurred to upgrade the grid. We also find that since there is ample room in the distribution lines to connect more wind parks, very few grid upgrades can allow to highly increase the distributed wind capacity with a low risk of wind curtailment. Moreover, even in scenarios with ‘high curtailment’ of 5% to 20%, projects are profitable. Thus, the Portuguese government should consider a policy where the guaranteed feed-in would be removed, and further assess the possibility of limiting profitability of the existing and new wind projects by introducing curtailment. This work compiles two perspectives: first, a temporal perspective, in which past and future assessments of wind power diffusion are described. Second, a perspective on policy characterization, in which we present an assessment of two characteristics in the feed-in tariff design: the level/period of the tariff and the conditionality of prioritizing wind power over fossilix fuel resources with absence of risk of wind power curtailment. The level and period-related policy recommendations are considered for the existing wind parks, and are addressed mainly in Chapter 3. Considerations about grid capacity and introducing a risk of wind power curtailment are considered for subsequent wind power capacity additions, and are mainly considered in Chapter 4. In addition, notice that Chapter 3 focuses on avoiding excessive profitability of wind power parks while in Chapter 4 we analyze wind and grid capacity additions under the perspective of wind investors. Nevertheless, as we also find in Chapter 4 that profits are excessive, we do make recommendations that limit wind investor’s revenue. Portuguese decision maker should give serious consideration to revisions to the Portuguese feed-in tariff policy design. Most of the existing Portuguese wind parks to not need a feed-in tariff to be profitable. A value associated with the risk of wind power curtailment for subsequent additions should be incorporated in future policy design. We expect that this work will contribute to the Portuguese renewable policy in particular in light of Portugal’s 2020 and 2030 wind power goals.",8/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721337.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For nearly 60 years, semiconductor technology has been defined by rapid rates of progress and concomitant decreases in costs-perfunction made possible by the extendibility of the silicon integrated-circuit. The stability of this technological paradigm has not only driven the transformation of the global economy but also deeply shaped scholars’ understanding of technological change. This study addresses the nature of technological change at the end of a paradigm and examines the role and capability of different institutions in shaping directions and responding to challenges during this period. This study first provides theoretical and historical context for the phenomenon under consideration. In order to place the dynamics of an industry at the end of a technology paradigm into proper context, particular attention is given to the semiconductor industry’s history of failed proclamations of impending limits. The examination of previous episodes of technological uncertainty and the development of institutions to respond to those episodes is used to illustrate the industry’s departure from previous modes of technological and institutional evolution. The overall findings suggest that existing institutions may not be capable of addressing the semiconductor industry’s looming technological discontinuity. Despite the creation of an entirely new institution, the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative, specifically oriented toward the end of Moore’s Law the industry, government agencies, and the scientific community writ large have been unable to find a successor to the silicon CMOS transistor to date.

Existing regulations have restricted direct PM emissions, especially for on-road sources; however, recent studies suggest that organic PM formed from the photo-oxidation of gaseous precursor emissions—so-called secondary organic aerosol (SOA)—contributes at least as much to the overall PM burden as PM “emitted from the tailpipe.” A major limitation of many of these studies is that they attempt to induce from the behavior of simple emission surrogates (e.g., vaporized whole fuel) the behavior of actual combustion emissions from real world sources. This research investigates combustion emissions directly. The primary gas- and particle-phase emissions, SOA production and SOA yields from a range of different on-road and off-road combustion sources were characterized. LDGV, MDDV and HDDV were driven on chassis dynamometers over realistic, urban driving cycles. Off-road sources, including 2- and 4-stroke lawn and garden equipment and a diesel transportation refrigeration unit were tested using engine dynamometers operated over certification cycles. For nearly all gasoline engines (LDGV and SOREs), photo-oxidizing dilute combustion emissions for 3 hours produced at least as much SOA as the directly emitted primary PM. SOA increased net PM production for LDGV by a factor of 1-10, depending on the vehicle emission standard. SOA yields were found to increase with newer vehicles, which have lower primary emissions. SOA for diesel vehicles, while still large on an absolute basis, was a smaller fractionof the primary PM emissions (between 10-30%), due to the very high elemental carbon (EC) emissions from vehicles without diesel particulate filters (DPF). Aftertreatment systems utilizing a DPF and a diesel oxidation catalyst essentially eliminated primary PM and SOA. Among the off-road sources, SOA from 2-stroke emissions increased the net PM by roughly a factor of 2. Primary emission and SOA production factors from the various combustion sources tested in this work were combined with fuel consumption data for California’s South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) to determine the impact on the aggregate PM from on- and off-road sources in the region. These estimated impacts were compared to the PM values derived from the regulatory models EMFAC and OFFROAD. Our data indicate that PM from on-road gasoline sources is significantly under-represented by existing emissions models due to the dominant role of SOA. When SOA production is included, newer LDGV are one of the largest sources of PM in SoCAB. Furthermore, LDGV will become an even more important PM source once existing regulations requiring DPF retrofits on both on- and off-road diesel sources are implemented over the next few years. While on-road diesel vehicles are currently an important source of PM based on total fuel consumption, LDGV are responsible for a larger fraction of total PM. The primary and secondary PM contribution of off-road sources also appear to be high, but the magnitude remains highly uncertain, pending further experimental data. Evidence is presented that suggests that existing models may dramatically overpredict primary PM emissions from off-road sources",8/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Secondary Organic Aerosol from On- and Off-Road Combustion Emissions,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721430.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to the current standard, ATSC 1.0, the 3.0 version will provide local broadcasters, among other things, 1) the ability toreplace a broadcaster’s single transmitter with a multi-transmitter Single Frequency Network (SFN) transmission architecture, 2) a flexible physical layer that allows broadcasters control over the trade-offs between bitrate, coverage and capacity, 3) additional program carrying capacity due to better source and channel coding, and 4) a full-IP platform able to perform interactive TV andtargeted advertising. This new standard will not only bring significant value to broadcast television services but also may reshape the broadcast television industry while both raising challenges for the existing U.S. regulatory frameworkand creating new opportunities to realize regulatory goals. Given this context, the thesis addresses some of the economic and public policy implications of a next-generation ATSC 3.0 television standard. This thesis is composed of three techno-economic studies that examinetelevision spectrum management and policy options related to three distinctive issues. In a first study, we analyze the potential of SFNs to improve broadcast spectrum efficiency by reducing spectrum reuse distances betweenbroadcasters’ coverage areas, thus potentially freeing spectrum for other uses such as cellular service. In a second study we analyze the flexibility given byATSC 3.0 to increase (or reduce) broadcasters coverage areas while still adhering to the power and interference constraints of their existing spectrum licenses,and the effect of reducing broadcasters authorized transmit power on freeing additional spectrum for additional TV licensees. Additional spectrum licenses could also facilitate simulcasting during the (likely lengthy) transitionfrom ATSC 1.0 to ATSC 3.0. Finally, in a third study we consider how using ATSC 3.0 to increase a station’s reach may result in increasing coverage overlapbetween same-network affiliates with implications for inter-market competition and retransmission consent. Together, these studies will provide insight to policymakers to facilitate understanding of some of the new economic andpolicy issues that could arise from the emergence of ATSC 3.0.",8/10/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7207619.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While reliable building codes are widely used in design, builders in developing countries often fail to meet acceptable standards. Structural defects are frequently identified too late, often after catastrophic collapse. In Kenya, more than eighty people have been killed, an over 290 injured, by collapsed buildings, since 2006. However, Kenya is not an exception. Throughout the world, in particular in countries with developing economies and growing populations, thousands of dangerously weak buildings will be built, and millions of people will be exposed to unnecessarily higher risks for generations. This research aims at contributing towards finding solutions to this problem by: 1) demonstrating that, in Kenya, many buildings are approved for occupation based on false material strength data produced by ineffective quality-control methods; 2) engaging the help of experts in Kenyan construction to list and ranked probable causes and plausible solutions to the problem of unsafe construction practices in Kenya; 3) presenting a method and a simulation model to estimate the damages in Nairobi (or other cities in Africa) in case of and earthquake, which can be used by policy makers when evaluating alternative policy interventions; and 4) proposing a strategy that combines the enforcement of quality reporting for construction, the open publication of the reports, the diffusion of non-destructive testing in construction, a risk communication program, and internet forums to help educate and provide guidance to the public in good construction practices.",12/9/24,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:57,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723218.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We start by recognizing that, independent of the industry organization, the uncertainties are enormous and often exogenous to the energy service providers. They are multi-dimensional and are result of fundamental drivers, ranging from the supply side, through the demand side, to the regulatory and policy sides. The basic contribution of this thesis comes from the recognition that long-term investments for ensuring reliable and stable electricity service critically depend on how these uncertainties are perceived, valued and managed by the different stakeholders within the complex industry organization such as the electric power industry. We explain several reasons why price signals obtained from current short-term electricity markets alone are not sufficient enough for long-term sustainable provision. Some enhancements are presented in the thesis to improve the short-term electricity market price signals to reflect the true cost of operation. New market mechanisms and instruments are needed to facilitate the stakeholders to better deal with long-term risks. The problems of ensuring long-term stable reliable service in the sense of the traditional resource adequacy requirements are revisited in both the restructuring industry and regulated industry. We introduce a so-called Stratum Electricity Market (SEM) design as the basic market mechanism for solving the problem of long-term reliable electricity service through a series of interactive multi-lateral market exchange platforms for risks communication, management and evaluations over various time horizons and by the different groups of stakeholders. In other words, our proposed SEM is a basic IT-enabled framework for the decision making processes by various parties over different time. Because of the uniqueness of electricity as a commodity, the values for the same amount of energy during different time and at different location can vary dramatically. Moreover, for the same hour, the values for the same amount of power at base load level or at peak load level are different due to the different generation technologies and other non-convex constraints like unit commitment. The multiple market products at zonal/nodal levels with different time horizon and time of use categories are designed to reflect more realistic demand and supply conditions at various temporal and spatial granularities. Detailed market rules, rights and regulations (3Rs) concerning the sub-markets interactions, product hierarchy and financial settlements are also examined.",5/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Stratum Electricity Markets,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723224.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research is oriented towards a more complete understanding of military capability and policy decisions about the structure and development of military forces. We identify the types of national and military policy decisions that claims of military capability inform, and find that there are five distinct types of capability claims relevant to military policy. We show how these types of capability claims are logically related to each other, but have different premises, predicates, and standards of proof. We find that one of these types of claims, General Organization Capability Claims, ties together the various military policy decisions. The remainder of this research shows how these capability claims can be formally structured based on military doctrine and structurally evaluated using a network-science based model. The interaction between the structural elements of a military organization (personnel, materiel, and information) and the things it is supposed to do (military tasks) can be represented and analyzed with network science methods, and represents a type of general organization capability claim. We present a method for representing policy decisions about unit structure and tactical doctrine. We then develop two versions of a structural model of capability–one that links the individual elements of an organization to the tasks it performs; another that considers the capacity of a set of organizations to meet a set of requirements. We show that network statistics of organizations represented off of authoritative, rather than observational, data are still consistent with network science findings but require interpretation. We also show how alternate methods of aggregating organizations can expand the utility of the capability measurement. This research presents five new contributions to the fields of military policy analysis and network science–(1) a taxonomy of military capability claims, (2) a meta-network model of doctrinal organization and task data, (3) a structural model of organization capability, (4) a structural model of organization capacity, and (5) a network-based method integer programming method.",5/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723242.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through large-scale measurements, we empirically describe some salient elements of the online criminal infrastructures, and we derive economic models characterizing the associated monetization paths enabling criminal profitability. This analysis reveals the existence of structural choke points: components of online criminal operations being limited in number, and critical for the operations’ profitability. Consequently, interventions targeting such components can reduce the opportunities and incentives to engage in online crime through an increase in criminal operational costs, and in the risk of apprehension. We define a methodology describing the process of distilling the knowledge gained from the empirical measurements on the criminal infrastructures towards identifying and evaluating appropriate countermeasures. We argue that countermeasures, as defined in the context of situational crime prevention, can be effective for a long-term reduction in the occurrence of online crime.",8/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723266.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior analyses have examined the potential for nuclear energy to play a role in decarbonizing the energy sector, one of the largest contributors to emissions worldwide. However, advanced, non-light water reactors, while often touted as a viable alternative for development, have languished. Large light water development projects have a repeated history of extended construction timelines, re-work delays, and significant capital risk. With few exceptions, large-scale nuclear projects have demonstrated neither affordability nor economic competitiveness, and are not well suited to nations with smaller energy grids, or to replace fossil generation in the industrial process heat sector. If nuclear power is to play a role in decarbonization, new policy and technical solutions will be needed. In this manuscript, we examine key aspects of past performance across the nuclear enterprise and explore the future potential of nuclear energy worldwide, focusing on policy and technical solutions that may be needed to move nuclear power forward as a part of a low-carbon energy future. We do so first at a high level, examining the history of nuclear power research and development in the United States, the nation that historically has led the way in the development of this generating technology. A significant portion of our analysis is focused on new developments in this technology – advanced non-light water reactors and small modular reactors. We find that while there are promising technical solutions available, improved funding and focus in research and new models of deployment may be needed if nuclear is to play a continuing or future role.

Additionally, provisions of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) have led to smart grid investments in the United States. Smart grid upgrades have included the installation of new technologies at all levels of the electric power delivery system. At the distribution system level modernization has included upgrades to communication systems, distribution automation, local control and protection systems, and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). Chapter 2 of this thesis aims to use elements of the emerging smart grid at the distribution system level to alleviate the effects of a widespread and long-duration power blackout. Despite continuing efforts to make the electric grid robust, some risk remains of widespread and extended power outages caused by extreme weather, human error, or premeditated terrorist attack. Chapter 2 applies the concept of survivability to the case of ensuring the continued provision of a subset of socially critical services during such blackouts. A load cycling based methodology is proposed, and an associated economic analysis indicates that the cost of implementing the proposed scheme constitutes less than 1% of median annual household income for a range of assumed outage probabilities, distributed generation resource availabilities, and financing options. While the technical elements of proposed scheme are largely feasible, a few policy changes are identified as necessary for successful implementation of the scheme. The latter half of this thesis focuses on one potential security risk posed by the large-scale deployment of smart meters. Smart meters constitute one component of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), a key element of the smart grid. Chapter 3 describes a few documented smart meter hacking strategies and motivates the following question: What, if any, are the implications of smart meter hacking for the bulk power grid? To help answer this question Chapter 4 focuses on one specific attack type with the potential for causing widespread disruption to electric service – the cycling of a large number of consumer loads using the remote connect/disconnect switch on several smart meters. Results from simulations performed on two IEEE test networks (the 9 and 39-bus dynamic test cases) indicate that it is improbable that the mere toggling of customer loads could destabilize the bulk power grid because the fraction of system load that needs to be cycled to induce instability is likely to be prohibitively large.",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,The Emerging Smart Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723584.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the implementation of climate regulations, the viability of different technologies will begin to change as decreased emissions begin to be incentivized. This thesis addresses how proposed climate regulations necessitating use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) will affect water use from new fossil-fuel fired power generation as well as how climate changes and policies could affect water use from the electricity generation sector on the whole in the long term. This thesis also addresses the economic viability of existing coal-fired power plants using carbon capture and storage (CCS) retrofits under the impending market structure of the finalized Clean Power Plan. Chapter 1 examines the water use impacts of the proposed New Source Performance Standards for CO2 emissions new fossil fuel-fired electricity generation units proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in September 2013. To meet the emissions requirements of this regulation, coal-fired units will require use of CCS at 40% capture, increasing water use by approximately 30%, though added water use varies with plant and CCS designs. More stringent standards could require CCS at natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants as well. When examined over a range of emission standards, new NGCC plants consume roughly 60 to 70% less water than coal-fired plants. Chapter 2 quantifies plant and regional shifts in water consumption from the energy generation sector in light of ambient climate changes and potential regulation shifts from climate mitigation policies on a 100-year planning horizon in the Southwest. Employing an integrated modeling framework, feedbacks between climate change, air temperature and humidity, and v consequent power plant water requirements are assessed. These direct impacts of climate change on water consumption by 2095 range from a 3%-7% increase over scenarios that do not incorporate ambient air impacts. Adaptation strategies to lower water use include the use of advanced cooling technologies and greater dependence on solar and wind. Water consumption may be reduced by 50% in 2095 from the reference from an increase in dry cooling shares to 35- 40%. This reduction could also be achieved through solar and wind power generation constituting 60% of the grid, necessitating a 250% in technology learning rates. Chapter 3 analyzes the economic feasibility of retrofitting carbon capture and storage (CCS) to existing coal-fired electricity generating units (EGUs) in Texas for compliance with the Clean Power Plan's rate-based emission standards under an emission trading scheme. Using a database of 18 technologically capable EGUs in Texas, CCS retrofits are modeled under a range of scenarios. Through an emission rate credit (ERC) marketplace, units enlisting the use of 90% capture of CO2 would prove to be more profitable than existing units at average prices of $27.8 per MWh under the final state standard. The combination of ERC trading and CO2 utilization can greatly reinforce economic incentives and market demands for CCS to accelerate large-scale deployment, even under scenarios with high retrofit costs. This chapter additionally compares the costs of electricity generation between CCS retrofits and renewable technology under the trading scheme, finding that EGUs retrofitted with CCS may not only be competitive with wind and solar, but more profitable under certain market conditions.",5/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,The Future of Low Carbon Electric Power Generation,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723599.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These vehicles have caused serious climate change effects from emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) and health and environmental impacts from criteria air pollutant (CAP). The recent success of shale gas development has brought industry interest in using natural gas to power on-road vehicles. In addition to low costs and wide availability of this national fuel source, natural gas is a common feedstock to produce alternative fuels. The question arises of whether using natural gas for transportation could help or hinder the environment. In this dissertation, I study the economic and environmental effects of a wide range of natural gas fuel pathways for a selection of light duty (LDV) and medium and heavy duty (MHDV) vehicle types. I choose to focus on two environmental metrics: GHGs and CAPs emitted over the life cycle of each potential pathway for natural gas use. First in Chapters 2 and 3, I use life-cycle analysis to understand the emissions of GHGs from different natural gas pathway for LDVs and MHDVs. Then in Chapter 4 I focus on the CAP emissions from these vehicles. Overall, I find that none of the natural gas pathways eliminate life cycle air emissions. In fact, only a few pathways reduce life cycle GHG emissions and/or life cycle air pollution damages compared to baseline petroleum fuels (gasoline for light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and diesel for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs)). For the cases of light duty vehicles (LDVs) and transit buses, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) powered by natural gas-based electricity provide significant reduction in life cycle GHG emissions and life cycle air pollution damages (for almost all counties) compared to the baseline petroleum fuels. However, the actual electricity that charges BEVs may not be natural gas-based electricity in most parts of the U.S. When powered by U.S. grid electricity (using average emission factors for 2010 and 2014), BEVs reduce life cycle GHG emissions to a lesser extent but increase life cycle air pollution damages significantly. Compressed natural gas (CNG), while reducing GHG emissions and CAP emissions (except CO) at tailpipe, are more likely to increase life cycle GHG emissions and increase life cycle air pollution damages in the majority of U.S. counties. For heavy-duty trucks, CNG sparking-ignition (SI) trucks and liquefied natural gas (LNG) high-pressure direct ignition (HPDI) trucks have mixed environmental impacts. While they are unlikely to reduce life cycle GHG emissions compared to diesel, they reduce life cycle air pollution damages in 76-99% of U.S. counties for local-haul tractor-trailers and in 32-71% of U.S. counties for long-haul tractor-trailers. In Chapters 5 and 6, I examine the economic impacts of natural gas fuel pathways for two vehicle types, tractor-trailers and transit buses. I study the economic feasibility of a national natural gas refueling infrastructure for long-haul trucks in U.S., which is a prerequisite for natural gas tractor-trailers. I find that a transition to natural gas fuels in long-haul trucks is more expensive when the shares of natural gas trucks are below 5% because of low refueling demands and over-capacity of the refueling infrastructure to ensure network coverage. At higher shares of natural gas trucks, both the total refueling capacity and the net economic benefits of the national refueling infrastructure increase almost linearly as adoption increases. Finally, in Chapter 6, I provide an economic-technology assessment for transit buses by considering both life cycle ownership costs and life cycle social costs due to GHG emissions and CAP emissions. Transit buses are early adopters of alternative fuel technologies because of funding supports and operation characteristics (such as high fuel consumption and private refueling infrastructure). I find that the availability of external funding is crucial for transit agencies to adopt any alternative fuel option. Without external funding, only rapid-charging battery electric buses (BEBs) have lower ownership & social costs than conventional diesel buses. When external funding is available to reduce bus purchase costs by 80%, BEBs become much more cost-effective. In this case, life cycle ownership and social costs of BEBs are 37-43% lower than conventional diesel buses. Including life cycle social costs does not change the ranking of alternative fuel options. The findings in this dissertation suggest different strategies of using natural gas for different vehicle markets. Natural gas is best used in electric power generation than to produce gaseous or liquid fuels for powering on-road LDVs. The use of CNG and LNG for heavy-duty trucks may continue as there are less alternative fuel options but issues such as methane leakage should be addressed to avoid important climate change effect. Finally, natural gas-based transportation fuels can at best partially mitigate climate change or air pollution damages, so other mitigation strategies in the transportation sector are ultimately needed to achieve sustainable transportation.",12/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly",,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723605.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Privacy is oftentimes not tangible, complicating the efforts of technology users to express and act according to their privacy needs. Additionally, people may not be fully aware of the risks they are subjecting themselves to once they use the Internet for financial transactions, or create profiles on online social networks. Companies post privacy policies inform people about their informational practices; but, this information is extremely difficult to use and typically not considered in users’ decision-making processes. Privacy concerns have also had an impact on users’ adoption of new technologies that share personal information. A plethora of mobile location-finding technologies applications have become available over the last two decades, but the products and services offered by the technology developers may not comprehensively address the privacy implications and privacy concerns surrounding their use. The design considerations for these products may not provide the necessarily amount of control or risk mitigation for users to ensure that their location information is not misused. In this thesis, I focus on the impact of salient privacy information on privacy concerns and behavior in two contexts: online shopping and the use of a mobile-location sharing technology. I examine several case studies focusing on the evolution of privacy attitudes after people use specific technologies. Based on the examination of the use of a location-sharing system, I highlight several design considerations for mobile-location application developers to ensure they address their users privacy concerns. I use the results of online surveys and user studies to provide concrete information on the impact of feedback on the comfort with using location-sharing technology.

In different countries these sector specific organizations are different in terms of structure, scope and level of independence. Nonetheless, these independent regulatory authorities (IRA) take various decisions that are often proved to be vital to change the course of the specific sector. This research aims to understand what influences the regulatory decisions and how the decisions impact the course of the sector. Mobile telephony and Internet revolutionized the telecommunication marketplace since early 1990s. Better technology made transfer of real time voice and video transfer via Internet affordable and ubiquitous. The need for spectrum increased as the use of mobile data increased. Traditional regulatory regimes recognize ‘voice’ and ‘data’ to be distinct services. With Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), this regulatory notion is gradually becoming obsolete. Now wired, wireless and Internet based telecom services are competing in the voice telephony market. With competition, customers are migrating to newer, cheaper and better quality services. The barrier to this free movement is the absence of number portability- customer’s ability to keep the phone number when she migrates from the existing service provider to a better alternative. The regulators are now facing new challenges –legalization of VoIP, introduction of mobile number portability, decisions to award electromagnetic spectrum via auction, legalization of reusing specific spectrum band and mandating neutrality of technology for specific technology generations. Broadly, these regulatory choices can be divided into three categories- decision to introduce new technology (legalization of Voice over IP), decision to enhance competition (introduction of mobile number portability) and decision to manage scarce resources efficiently (spectrum related decisions). This thesis is a novel addition to the anthology of telecommunication regulation, technology policy, institutional economics and political science. Theoretical works that explain the dynamics of the regulatory institutions and their decisions are in abundance. However, quantitative scrutiny is scarce. We try to fill the gap through empirical research. We ascertain how over all politicoregulatory environment impact certain regulatory decisions, and how these decisions impact diffusion of a certain technology generation, price of telephony and the country’s economic growth. The dataset is of time-series-cross-sectional form consisting of 145 countries of the world. It contains information regarding political conditions (such as system of the governments, parliament, regulatory design (such as composition of the institution, independence, functions), socio-economic condition (such as income level), and communication-market specific data (such as various regulatory decisions, sector performance indicators). With the help of the dataset, this thesis ascertains firstly the impact of the institutional environment on the regulatory choices and secondly the impact of these choices on the marketplace. Our estimations find that in the telecommunications sector, it is not the over all political condition but the construct of the regulatory structure-independence and scope that enables the regulators to take decisions in favor of technologies and interventions that may be paradigm shifting and disruptive. We find that the decisions related to spectrum management, have positive impact on diffusion. However, the ‘one size fit all solution’ does not work well as in terms of consumer price and GDP growth, influence of these interventions affect the countries of different economic level and geopolitical locations differently. We also find evidence that, whilst the institutions impact various regulatory decisions which in turn impact the diffusion of technologies, the variables of the institutions do not have direct influence on the diffusion process.",12/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723626.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What factors explain this travel behavior and what sort of policy responses are required to effect changes? In responding to this question, we used multiple test beds and made the case for a demand side management approach to remedy parking problems particularly observed in cities central business districts. To this end, we provide an overview of travel behavior and information on policy levers by generating detailed profiles that capture the travel behavior of commuters in the Pacific states of the continental United States. Building off the result that revealed San Francisco as an outlier, we examine the efficacy of modifying parking rates, via elasticity measures, to influence the demand for parking by developing a two-stage panel data regression optimization model for managing parking in the City of San Francisco. A key contribution of the research is deriving these price elasticities of parking demand estimates using panel data methods. Coefficient estimates from the panel data regression are used to fit a linear prediction model that is the primary input to the optimization model. The balance of the thesis focuses on parking information by discussing the design and implementation of ParkPGH, a novel smart parking application that provides real time and predictive information on garage parking availability in downtown Pittsburgh. At its core is a predictive model that uses as input historical parking, weather and event data to provide estimates of available parking spaces. We provide an example of the model implementation using data from the Theater Square garage where we utilize neural network-based predictors and multiple net searches to generate both continuous and binary estimates of parking availability.

We analyze the conditions that facilitate developing country entrepreneurs to learn about business models and the incentive of local and multinational firms to carry out experiments for BoP adaptations. We test our frameworks’ implications on the evolution of the mobile telecommunications industry across Africa. Contrary to the economic models that posit one-directional investments from the North to the South, our findings suggest a two-step industrialization process. The spillover of modern-industry knowledge from the North through Joint Ventures enables a few entrepreneurial firms in the South to gain access to valuable knowledge with which they actively experiment and, through successful BoP adaptations, gain ownership advantages and further internationalize across the South, catalyzing the growth of the industry. Overall, the thesis shows how these entrepreneurial firms with a particular heritage are at the core and explain most of the development of the mobile industry in sub-Saharan Africa. This thesis further explores the factors that influenced the diffusion of mobile telephony in Africa. Whereas prior research has focused on the role of country and industry characteristics in country-level measures namely the adoption rate of new products and services, price, total investment and employment in related sector, this thesis examines whether such patterns across countries can be influenced by the heterogeneity in quality of firms that enter in those countries.

The primary setting for these studies is the mobile financial services industry. Additionally, this dissertation looks at the overall significance of user innovation at the country level in order to discern drivers of user innovation diffusion. Finally, it investigates implications for innovation policy. These topics are addressed in three studies. The first study examines two main research questions. First, to what extent can users play a role in innovation in developing countries? Second, what is the global relevance and diffusion of innovations that originate in developing countries? This study finds that users pioneered over half of mobile financial services and that 85% of the services originated in developing countries. A comparison between all innovations in this industry shows that user innovations diffuse at more than double the rate of firm innovations. Additionally, three-quarters of the innovations that originated in developing countries diffused to OECD countries. This study also proposes a new methodology to analyze the sources of service innovations, which can be used in future research. The second study tries to answer the following research question: Under what conditions can industries emerge in the economic ‘South’? In addition, what firms are successful at entering in the South? This study uses a hand-collected dataset from the mobile financial services industry. We find that latent demand is an important driver for firm entry in developing countries, as is market share. Furthermore, previous entry in the industry leads to industry-specific knowledge accumulation, which spills over within firms and increases the likelihood of subsequent entry into other countries. The third study examines the characteristics of diffusion of user innovations using data from a large-scale national survey conducted in Portugal. It looks at differences between market and non-market channels of diffusion for professional-user innovators as well as end-user innovators. The main findings are that although most user innovators are willing to share their innovations for free, they do not actively inform other people about their solutions, which negatively affects diffusion. Furthermore, this research concludes that professional-user innovators are significantly more likely to protect their intellectual property than end-user innovators, which increases the likelihood of commercialization of the innovation.",5/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Three Studies on Innovation and Diffusion,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723911.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It provides insights on how trade secret protection can increase venture capital (VC) investment through a state court’s favorability toward the inevitable disclosure doctrine, the effect of anti-takeover regulation as it relates to private equity firm buyout performance, and the role that political context has in determining VC distributions to different states. Data analysis is based on Thomson Reuters’ VentureXpert for VC investment and geography, inevitable disclosure rulings gathered from multiple sources, a proprietary database on private equity firm buyout performance, and election results at the state and national levels of the United States. Three studies were conducted, which comprise this dissertation. The first paper investigates how inevitable disclosure, a form of trade secret protection, affects the geography of VC investment in the United States. Results show that a rule in favor of inevitable disclosure increases the overall amount of VC inflows and the proportion of investment by non-local VCs in a state more than an against or no rule. Mechanisms are addressed that can explain these findings by considering how a court decision on inevitable disclosure might increase the probability of obtaining a court injunction against a former employee departure and the predictability of that probability. The second paper extends experiential learning theory by arguing that the degree of causal ambiguity in firm decisions likely differs not only across different settings (i.e. operational vs. strategic), but also across different stages of the same strategic decision. With particular regard to acquisitions, the selection stage seems to be less causally ambiguous than the restructuring stage. Since experience translates into learning to a lesser extent when causal ambiguity is greater, acquisition experience translates more readily into learning to select than into learning to add value. Accordingly, results show that more experienced acquirers should perform better in scenarios when the focal acquisition is more selection- (rather than restructuring-) oriented, such as when (1) the educational background of the acquiring firm’s top management is more finance- (rather than business-) oriented; and (2) the information environment is less transparent. Results are largely consistent with the notion that correlation between acquisition experience and performance is more positive when the firm’s capacity to select target companies is more relevant. The third paper attempts to uncover the effects of political context, as it relates to VC distributions to different states across the United States. The primary finding is that VC investment distributions increase when states that elect a Republican governor also vote for a Democratic presidential candidate (regardless if that candidate wins). Additionally, as the stability of a Republican gubernatorial regime increases, VC investment decreases. Finally, results show that policies that improve the quality of financial institutions (through the number of IPOs) might help explain the political effects on VC, whereas tax policy (through capital gains tax rate) and proentrepreneurship policy (through the number of new firms) do not.",5/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Three Studies on Institutional Environment and the Private Equity Continuum,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723914.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YZVWCIWM,thesis,2012,"Horowitz, Shira R.",Topics in Residential Electric Demand Response,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Topics_in_Residential_Electric_Demand_Response/6723944/1,"Demand response and dynamic pricing are touted as ways to empower consumers, save consumers money, and capitalize on the “smart grid” and expensive advanced meter infrastructure. In this work, I attempt to show that demand response and dynamic pricing are more nuanced. Dynamic pricing is very appealing in theory but the reality of it is less clear. Customers do not always respond to prices. Price differentials are not always large enough for customers to save money. Quantifying energy that was not used is difficult. In chapter 2, I go into more detail on the potential benefits of demand response. I include a literature review of residential dynamic pilots and tariffs to see if there is evidence that consumers respond to dynamic rates, and assess the conditions that lead to a response. Chapter 3 explores equity issues with dynamic pricing. Flat rates have an inherent cross-subsidy built in because more peaky customers (who use proportionally more power when marginal price is high) and less peaky customers pay the same rates, regardless of the cost they impose on the system. A switch to dynamic pricing would remove this cross subsidy and have a significant distributional impact. I analyze this distributional impact under different levels of elasticity and capacity savings. Chapter 4 is an econometric analysis of the Commonwealth Edison RTP tariff. I show that it is extremely difficult to find the small signal of consumer response to price in all of the noise of everyday residential electricity usage. Chapter 5 looks at methods for forecasting, measuring, and verifying demand response in direct load control of air-conditioners. Forecasting is important for system planning. Measurement and verification are necessary to ensure that payments are fair. I have developed a new, censored regression based model for forecasting the available direct load control resource. This forecast can be used for measurement and verification to determine AC load in the counterfactual where DLC is not applied. This method is more accurate than the typical moving averages used by most ISO’s, and is simple, easy, and cheap to implement.",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723944.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As more hospitals adopt EHR, focus has shifted to how these records can be used to improve patient care. One barrier to this improvement is limited information exchange between providers. In this work I examine the role of EHR vendors, hypothesizing that vendors strategically control the exchange of clinicalhospital exchanging clinical summaries with hospitals outside its health system increases as the percentage ofhospitals with the same EHR vendor in the region increases. When reviewing the relationship of vendor market concentration at the state level I find a positive significantrelationship with the percentage of hospitals that share clinical care summaries within a state. However, I find no significant impact from state policies designed to incentivizeinformation exchange through the State Health Information Exchange Cooperative Program. In order to avoid closed networks that foreclose some hospitals, it is importantthat future regulation attempt to be more inclusive of hospitals that do not use large vendors and are therefore unable to use proprietary methods for exchange.Chapter 3 explores the mental models of patients and how it may affect the implementation of tools to enhance adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART). Highlevels of adherence to ART are necessary to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant HIV virus and delay disease progression. For this reason, a number of interventionshave been designed to support adherence for people living with HIV (PLWH). However, widely used adherence interventions, though successful for some populations, still fail certain vulnerable groups. The mental model approach allows us to go beyond current decision-making models to understand context specific aspects of behavior mostrelevant to this group. I interview nine high-risk non-adherents and compare their mental models to non-adherence models as seen by experts. In this study I identified how scarcity conditions and the several ways in which adhering to ARVs induces negative affect can influence the cost-benefit analysis that decision makers engage in when deciding to take their medication. Further work needs to be done to understand theprevalence of this decision-making biases in order to design more inclusive interventions. Chapter 4 explores the use of future self interventions (FSI) and the possibleunintended consequences of their use in health decision making due to negative perceptions of aging. Many leading causes of mortality and morbidity in developedcountries stem from health risk factors that are influenced by individual choices. Improving decision makers’ understanding of how benefits will accrue to themselves inthe future could inform health choices over their lifespan. However, negative attitudes toward aging related to the view of declining health or illness during this period could beuniquely relevant when the decision maker determines the utility of future health. The goal of this study is to examine how the relationships between future self connectiongenerated by FSI along with expectations of aging and aging anxiety influence the anticipated valuation of future health. Participants between the ages of 18 and 45 wererecruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. They were then assigned to participate in one of three groups of letter-writing exercises, a control, one to the self 20 years in the futureand another to the 68-year-old version of the self. Our results suggest that a connection with the future aged self interacts with aging anxiety in ways that decrease the value adecision maker assesses to future quality of life. As we expected, we found that a positive effect of expectations regarding aging, however, this effect is lower for those inthe intervention group who were tasked with writing a letter to a far-off future self. Furthermore, we find that anticipated health utility has a negative effect on the healthdiscount rate. This study provides evidence that there are unique characteristics of aging that may impact future health valuation which should be considered before usingFSI to incentivize future oriented health behavior.",9/24/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7212443.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the magnitude of investment costs, their irreversibility, and their impact in the overall development of a region, accounting for the role of uncertainties as well as the involvement of multiple parties in the decision process allows for improved and more robust investment decisions. Even though the creation of this internal energy market requires attention to flexibility and strategic decision-making, existing literature and practitioners have not given proper attention to these topics. Using portfolios of real options, we present two stochastic mixed integer linear programming models for transmission network expansion planning. We study the importance of explicitly addressing uncertainties, the option to postpone decisions and other sources of flexibility in the design of transmission networks. In a case study based on the Azores archipelago we show how renewables penetration can increase by introducing contingency planning into the decision process considering generation capacity uncertainty. We also present a two-party Nash-Coase bargaining transmission capacity investment model. We illustrate optimal fair share cost allocation policies with a case study based on the Iberian market.

Using forecasts for decision-making is complicated by their inherent uncertainty. An interview-based study qualitatively and a survey empirically investigate forecast use in emergency management. Emergency managers perceive uncertainty as a given rather than as a problem. To cope with the uncertainty, decision-makers gather as much information as possible; forecasts are only one piece of information among many. For decision-making, emergency managers say that they rely more on radar than on river forecasting. However, forecasts play an important role in communication with the public, because they are the official interpretation of the situation. Emergency managers can add a lot of value to those forecasts by combining them with local knowledge, but might not do so because of accountability concerns. Forecasts must have value to emergency managers, because those with more work experience rely more on them than those without. Another study further develops the application of quantile regression to generate probabilistic river forecasts. Compared to existing research, this study includes a larger number of river gages; includes more independent variables; and studies longer lead times. Additionally, it is the first to apply this method to the U.S. American context. It was found that the model has to be customized for each river gage for extremely high event thresholds. For other thresholds and across lead times, a one-size-fits-all model suffices. The model performance is robust to the size of the training dataset, but depends on the year, the river gage, lead time and event threshold that are being forecast. An additional study considers the robustness of stormwater management to the amount of runoff. Impervious surfaces, such as roads and parking lots, can increase the amount of runoff and lead to more pollution reaching streams, rivers, and lakes. Best Management Practices (BMPs) reduce the peak discharge into the storm sewer system and remove pollutants such as sediments, phosphorus and nitrogen from the stormwater runoff. Empirically, it is found that BMP effectiveness decreases sooner, steeper and deeper with increasing sizes of storm events than assumed in current computer models.",12/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Uncertainty in River Forecasts,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6724103.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most previous works rely on descriptive statistics obtained from place-based case studies representing major cities, metropolitan areas, and counties using emissions inventories that may have inconsistent and/or limited scope (e.g., transportation and residential emissions only). This limits the potential for general insights and decision support related to the role of urbanization in CO2 emissions reduction. Here, I implement generalized linear and multiple linear regression analyses to obtain robust insights on the relationship between urbanization and CO2 emissions in the U.S. I used consistently derived county-level scope 1 & 2 CO2 inventories for my response variable while predictor variables included dummy-coded variables for county geographic type (central, outlying, and non-metropolitan), median household income, population density, and climate indices (heating degree days (HDD) and cooling degree days (CDD)). There is statistically significant difference in per capita emissions by sector for different county types, with transportation and residential emissions highest in nonmetropolitan (rural) counties, transportation emissions lowest in central (most urbanized) counties, and commercial sector emissions highest in central counties. More importantly, contrary to most previous findings, there is not enough statistical evidence indicating that per capita scope 1 & 2 emissions differ by geographic type, ceteris paribus. These results are robust for different assumed electricity emissions factors. Given that emissions production rate in more urban counties are not significantly different from that of less urban ones and population is concentrated in urban counties, significant national emissions reduction could be achieved if efforts are focused on central counties. There are various climate mitigation techniques – both from the supply and demand side. Given the large contribution of transportation in total county emissions and the fact that this technology bridges the transportation and electricity sector which is currently the biggest contributor to CO2 emissions, I investigated the emission reduction benefits from driving electric instead of gasoline vehicles. Vehicle electrification has also received sustained support from the local to the supranational level and is seeing an optimistic market trend. I characterize and assess the uncertainty in CO2 emissions per mile travelled for vehicles in the U.S. given regional variation and uncertainty in electricity emissions factor (marginal vs average, generation- vs consumption-based, different regional boundaries), driving pattern, and daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT). I also investigate vehicle emissions estimates under convenience (vehicle starts charging when it arrives at home) and delayed (vehicle starts charging at 12am) charging. Using marginal emissions factors results in electric vehicle emissions estimate that are higher than average emissions estimates in the northeastern and north central U.S., and lower emissions in the south central U.S. In other regions, using marginal emissions versus average emissions factors may lead to differences in emissions estimates by as much as 28%. Delayed charging leads to higher emissions, given that off-peak electricity demand is supplied by fossil generators in most regions (e.g., coal). Using marginal emissions estimates, the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle has lower operation emissions compared to the Toyota Prius (the most efficient US gasoline vehicle) in western U.S., and the Leaf has higher operation emissions in the north central, regardless of assumed charging scheme and estimation method. In other regions the comparison is uncertain because of regional variation and uncertainty in emission factor estimates. Consumption- and generation-based marginal emissions also significantly (5 % - 28%), enough to result unclear comparison results. Average vehicle emissions estimates under different regional boundary definitions also differ significantly (e.g., state-based estimates deviate from National Electricity Reliability Commission (NERC) region-based estimates by as much as 122%). Other factors such as driving pattern and daily vehicle miles traveled also influence vehicle emissions. I conduct a locational comparison of electric and gasoline vehicle life cycle emissions in the U.S. taking into consideration the regional variation in the joint effect of consumption-based marginal electricity emission factors, driving pattern (city, highway or combined), and daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT) distribution. I find that electricity generation emissions rate, determined by grid mix and charging scheme, has the largest influence on electric vehicle emission levels and the emissions differences of gasoline and electric vehicles. Secondary to this is urbanization level, especially for PHEVs, as it influences driving pattern and daily vehicle miles traveled. Highest CO2 emission reductions from electric vehicles can be attained in metropolitan counties in CA, TX, FL, NY, and New England states. Policies for wider adoption of electric vehicles such as incentives and other adoption facilitating mechanisms including investments in public charging infrastructure are encouraged in metropolitan counties, especially the denser ones. On the other hand, these policies are discouraged in north central states where electric vehicles would only increase emissions because of a relatively carbon-intensive grid. These findings reflect the pivotal role of the electricity and transportation sectors nexus in achieving national goals of CO2 emission reductions. Unless the U.S. decarbonizes its electricity system further, electric vehicles will only be beneficial in climate mitigation efforts in certain locations in the country.",12/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Urbanization and Vehicle Electrification in the United States,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6724184.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis applies research on vigilance, people’s ability to detect anomalies for a sustained period, to phishing risk. I (1) measure the human component of phishing susceptibility, (2) evaluate the validity of that measurement, and (3) demonstrate an approach for applying those measurements to risk analysis and evaluating behavioral interventions. I quantify human performance using signal detection theory (SDT) for a detection task (deciding whether a message is phishing) and a behavior task (deciding what to do about a message). As applied to phishing, SDT distinguishes between users’ ability to tell the difference between phishing and legitimate emails (called sensitivity, or d’) and bias toward identifying uncertain emails as phishing or legitimate (called response bias, or c). I find that users do not sufficiently compensate for their limited detection ability when choosing behaviors, despite incorporating confidence in their ability and their assessment of the consequences of errors into their decisions. I find similar results in an initial convenience (mTurk) sample and a community sample (enrolled in the Security Behavior Observatory (SBO) study). I find weak evidence for external validity of these tasks, given no relationship between performance in the experiment and negative computer security outcomes in real life (e.g. visits to malicious URLs or presence of malicious files). These results prompt discussion of the challenges of comparing behavior in laboratory and complex real-world settings. Lastly, I create an analytic model for evaluating anti-phishing behavioral interventions in the face of random and spear phishing attacks. Our results suggest the value of focusing on more susceptible users, particularly when defending against random attacks. This recommendation applies even when the ability to identify poor detectors is imperfect. Overall, this thesis bridges the vigilance and computer security literature to improve measurement of phishing susceptibility and show the value of assessing behavioral interventions in terms of signal detection theory.",8/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6724199.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29GFC4S5,thesis,2017,"Zhang, Xiaochen",Welfare Properties of Recommender Systems,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Welfare_Properties_of_Recommender_Systems/6724262/1,"Recommender systems are ubiquitously used by online vendors as profitable tools to boost sales and enhance the purchase experience of their consumers. In recent literature, the value created by recommender systems are discussed extensively. In contrast, few researchers look at the negative side of the recommender systems from the viewpoint of policymakers. To fill this gap, I critically investigate the welfare impact of recommender systems (RSs) during my Ph.D. study. The main focus of my Ph.D. dissertation is analyzing whether there exists a conflict of interest between the recommendations provider and its consumers in the electronic marketplace. My dissertation is composed of three parts. In Part I, I evaluate empirically whether in the real world, the profit-driven firm will choose a recommendation mechanism that hurts or is suboptimal to its consumers. In Part II, I analyze the role of personalization technology in the RSs from a unique perspective of how personalization resembles price discrimination as a profitable tool to exploit consumer surplus. In part III, I investigate the vendor’s motivation to increase the level of personalization in two-period transactions. As the RSs are designed by the firm, and the firm’s objective is to maximize profits, the RSs might not maximize consumers’ welfare. In Part I of my thesis work, I test the existence of such a conflict of interest between the firm and its consumers. I explore this question empirically with a concrete RS created by our industry collaborator for their Video-on-Demand (VoD) system. Using a large-scale dataset (300,000 users) from a randomized experiment on the VoD platform, I simulate seven RSs based on an exponential demand model with listed movie orders and prices as key inputs, estimated from the experimental dataset. The seven simulated RSs differ by the assignments of listed orders for selected recommended movies. Specifically, assignments are chosen to maximize profits, consumer surplus, social welfare, popularity (IMDB votes and IMDB ratings), and previous sales, as well as random assignments. As a result, the profit-driven recommender system generates 8% less consumer surplus than the consumer-driven RSs, providing evidence for a conflict of interest between the vendor and its consumers. Major e-vendors personalize recommendations by different algorithms that depend on how much and types of consumer information obtained. Therefore, the welfare evaluations of personalized recommendation strategies by empirical methods are hard to generalize. In Part II of my thesis, I base my analysis of personalization in RSs on a conceptual approach. Under an analytic framework of horizontal product differentiation and heterogenous consumer preferences, the resemblance of personalization to price discrimination in welfare properties is presented. Personalization is beneficial to consumers when more personalization leads to more adoption of recommendations, since it decreases search costs for more consumers. However, when the level surpasses a threshold when all consumers adopt, a more personalized RS decreases consumer surplus and only helps the firm to exploit surplus from consumers. The extreme case of perfect personalization generates the same welfare results as first-degree price discrimination where consumers get perfectly fit recommendations but are charged their willingness-to-pay. As shown in Part II, personalization is always profitable for the monopoly seller. In Part III, I investigate the vendor’s motivation to increase the level of personalization in a two-period transactions. In the first period, consumers do not observe the true quality of the recommendations and choose to accept recommended products or not based on their initial guesses. In the second period, consumers fully learn the quality. The settings of consumer uncertainty and consumer learning incentivize the firm to charge lower-than-exploiting price for recommendations to ensure consumers’ first-period adoptions of the RS. Therefore, uncertainties mediate the conflicts of interest from the vendor’s exploitive behavior even though the vendor might strategically elevate consumers’ initial evaluation to reduce such effect.",5/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6724262.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q6DRD6YN,thesis,2011,"Dutt, Varun",Why do we want to defer actions on climate change? A psychological perspective,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Why_do_we_want_to_defer_actions_on_climate_change_A_psychological_perspective/6724268/1,"A 2007 U.N. survey found that 54% of Americans advocate ―wait-and-see‖ behavior on policies that mitigate climate change, i.e., they infer that climate mitigation actions can be deferred until there are clear signs of danger. By evaluating different cognitive factors that influence human behavior, this thesis builds a framework that provides answers to an important question: why do people advocate wait-and-see behavior on climate change? One cognitive factor is misperceptions of feedback (i.e., ignorance of large feedback delays between CO2 emission decisions and the corresponding changes in CO2 concentration). Results reveal that the use of simulation tools, that provide repeated feedback about decision actions and corresponding consequences, is likely to enable people to overcome these misperceptions. A second factor is people‘s reliance on correlational or linear thinking (that the shape of CO2 emissions and CO2 concentration should look alike). Results reveal that the use of a physical representation (i.e., a picture of a problem in the form of a metaphor), simulation tools, and presenting problems such people‘s reliance on heuristics and biases enables them to make ecofriendly decisions is likely to enable people to overcome their correlational thinking. Other cognitive factors that affect people‘s wait-and-see behavior include people‘s risk and time preferences about future climate consequences when these consequences are either described or experienced. Results reveal that descriptive methods (e.g., books, newspapers, and reports) are likely to produce more wait-and-see behavior due to a high probability, small cost, and late timing of future consequences; whereas, experiential methods (e.g., movies, imagery, and games) are likely to produce more wait-and-see behavior due to a low probability, large cost, and early timing of future consequences. Policy implications suggest a careful design of descriptive and experiential climate risk communication methods, and the use of above described manipulations to improve people‘s decision making on climate change.",8/1/11,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,Why do we want to defer actions on climate change?,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6724268.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
USNSMX34,journalArticle,2023,"Smillie, Sean",Challenges at the Interface of the Natural Gas and Electric Systems,,,,10.1184/R1/24104076.V1,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Challenges_at_the_Interface_of_the_Natural_Gas_and_Electric_Systems/24104076/1,"In the United States, natural gas consumption has grown significantly in recent years, growing by 39% from 2008 to 32 EJ in 2022. This dissertation contributes to understanding key challenges arising from this growth. One challenge is the increasing interdependence between the natural gas and electric systems, which presents a growing reliability risk. Most previous analyses focus on the increasing dependence of the electric system to gas deliveries, as natural gas’ share of electric generation increased from 21% in 2008 to 38% in 2021. The reverse dependence, where some compressor stations spaced every 50-100 miles along gas transmission lines rely on the electric grid, had not been rigorously examined. To determine the exposure of the natural gas interstate pipeline system to electric outages, I identify electrically-driven compressor stations in the US, finding that 10% depend on grid electricity. Using pipeline hydraulic models, I demonstrate that the consequence of disrupting power to a single compressor station can be downstream gas shortages to more than 2 GW of downstream gas-powered electric generators. I find that historical events show this is not just a theoretical possibility. In northern Florida I show that such an outage can be larger than the most severe single-cause failure currently considered in electric reliability planning. Electric utilities should incorporate the identified facilities into critical facility lists. Establishing a federal gas reliability organization could improve gas reliability by establishing appropriate reliability reporting, incident investigation, and minimum industry standards. Second, fuel switching from coal to natural gas in the US electric sector has contributed to recent modest decreases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a strategy which proponents of liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals argue their projects would replicate elsewhere. To test this assertion, I conduct a consequential lifecycle analysis (LCA) of GHG emissions from North American LNG export projects, including the change in global natural gas and coal use resulting from the market effects of increased LNG trade. For a 2.1 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd) LNG export facility, I estimate a change in global GHG emissions of -39 to +11 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e (90% range) with a median value of -8 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e. Reductions in emissions are more moderate and less certain than suggested by previous methods, which find a median value of -36 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e for this size project. The more modest reduction is due to estimates of higher domestic coal use and a smaller decrease in international coal use than assumed by previous methods. To accurately estimate the global net change in greenhouse gas emissions from LNG terminals, project regulators and policymakers must account for market effects. Third, more than half of US households use natural gas to heat their homes, which accounts for 7% of US GHGs. Electrification using heat pumps is often seen as the most promising method of decarbonizing this energy service. However, fully electrifying building heat is challenging, as it would significantly increase peak electric loads during cold weather. I evaluate the potential for hybrid heat pumps to cost-effectively decarbonize space heating while avoiding costly peak electric generation capacity costs. Hybrid heat pumps use an electric heat pump to satisfy the majority of annual heat demands but switches to a fueled heating source like a gas furnace during peak demand. I find that avoided electric generation capacity costs justify hybrid heat pump installations in colder northern regions, but not in southern regions. In northern regions, the avoided cost is approximately $2500 per dwelling, which is sufficient to justify the additional installation costs of a hybrid system compared to their all-electric heat pump alternative. In addition, the consumption of natural gas required for hybrid systems is small, less than 300 PJ in all scenarios. This is within estimates of renewable natural gas supply capacity found in the literature.",2023,5/20/25 15:33,5/20/25 15:33,5/20/25 15:33,5852703 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 5852703 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Public Policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation then applies these tools to study some of the most pressing subjects pertaining to air pollution in the U.S., including the energy transition away from coal, the increasing influence of wildfires on air quality and unhealthy pollution days, and environmental injustice regarding the disproportionate exposures to and health risks from particulate matter for vulnerable communities. The key takeaways herein are as follows. First, while air pollution in the U.S. has greatly declined since the passing of the Clean Air Act, damages are still extraordinary. This dissertation finds coal-fired power plants and wildland fires to cause air pollution damages on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars. Second, there is a paradigm shift regarding emission sources and the corresponding air pollution impacts in the U.S. While air pollution from most anthropogenic activities has greatly decreased, wildfire emissions are increasing. The implications are substantial for public health, regulatory compliance, and environmental modeling, as episodic events are the emergent threat. Third, there are substantial disparities in who is damaged by air pollution as well as who “wins” and “loses” as we continue to address the problem. The most vulnerable populations have historically been most impacted by emissions and substantially benefit from their reduction, whereas polluting industries and communities reliant on them are most at risk. That said, most stakeholders are better off with cleaner air, and innovative public policies can continue to achieve environmental progress while mitigating the losses. The study-specific findings herein are as follows. Both recent and potential benefits from coal’s decline far outweigh associated costs, and the government should fund policies supporting a swift and just clean energy transition. The marked net benefits of moving away from coal justify substantial investments in the hardest-hit communities. Daily PM2.5 variability is increasingly important, and the mathematical modeling of this phenomenon (conscious of challenges imposed by extreme wildfire events) can better inform air quality analysis and relevant decision-making. Finally, fire smoke is the new standout air pollution health risk in the U.S., and socially vulnerable populations are most exposed and damaged. Policymakers must consider the nexus of existing inequities and their influence on risk when devising solutions to address the deadly smoke.",2023,5/20/25 15:33,5/20/25 15:33,5/20/25 15:33,11278564 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 11278564 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Public Policy; Ecological Economics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current discourse surrounding web tracking has focused on the collection of browsing data and its use in the estimated $566B online advertising industry in the United States. As a result, existing privacy protections, both through tools like ad blockers and policy mechanisms like cookie consent banners, have been designed to provide a binary choice to users: either opt-in or optout of web tracking. To the user, this frames the issue of web tracking, and all derived use of data collected therein, as either inherently good or bad. However, this thesis demonstrates browsing data collected through web tracking can be used to both inflict privacy harm and to provide security benefits to users—providing evidence that the emphasis of our current privacy framework should be placed on data use, not data collection. Our limited understanding of web tracking, and its potential uses, derives from the lack of reliable browsing data that is available to researchers. While information about how users browse the web is abundantly collected in the private sector, for proprietary reasons it is rarely distributed. As such, this thesis starts with an examination of recruitment and retention in several longitudinal measurement panels, a recently employed method that has provided researchers with detailed browsing data collected over long periods of time. We provide a set of best practices and recommendations for the design of future web browsing studies. Using data from one of these panels, we then provide an updated and more detailed snapshot of how users browse the web. Among other findings, we demonstrate that individual browsing patterns are relatively unique but also habitual, and that there are common patterns leading users to less travelled, riskier areas of the internet. Building upon this foundation, in subsequent chapters we demonstrate that user browsing data collected through web tracking can be used to the detriment of users’ privacy but also to improve security outcomes. In terms of privacy harms, we first show that a user’s unique browsing behavior, their behavioral fingerprint, can be used to greatly reduce online anonymity and, combined with browser fingerprinting, can provide trackers with robust crosssite tracking methods without using browser cookies. Next, we demonstrate that information about visiting sensitive websites can be inferred from the advertising profiles generated by a major data aggregator, indicating that even legitimate use of browsing data presents a privacy risk to users. Finally, we also show that there are security benefits to web tracking by detecting user exposure to malicious websites based on their prior browsing activity. Based on these findings, we recommend that the current privacy framework surrounding web tracking place greater emphasis on how browsing data is used, rather than simply its collection. We evaluate a range of use cases for browsing data, provide recommendations to policymakers, and advocate for an expansion of user choice that involves options to consent to data collection <em>for specific purposes</em>. We close with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities that the dual nature of web tracking presents and make recommendations for future research.",2023,5/20/25 15:32,5/20/25 15:32,5/20/25 15:32,7506651 Bytes,,,,,,Tracking User Web Browsing Behavior,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 7506651 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Theoretical Computer Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KMZ2GZSU,thesis,2020,"Zhang, Nandi",Multi-Network Access: How It Can Benefit Network Operators and Consumers Alike,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Multi-Network_Access_How_It_Can_Benefit_Network_Operators_and_Consumers_Alike/11568666/1,"Consumers today are often simultaneously covered by multiple wireless communications networks that vary in throughput, latency, price, coverage, etc. Despite that, today's wireless services and mobile devices are set up to use the same network as long as that network is available, or to only communicate via Wi-Fi as long as a known Wi-Fi network is present. In this thesis, we show that there can be huge benefits to the alternative scheme, multi-network access (MNA), where a mobile device may use the infrastructure owned by any one of multiple network operators, at any point in space and time.MNA can greatly improve the spectral efficiency of cellular networks. Given uniformly distributed tower location, MNA can increase network capacity by over 50% without additional infrastructure or spectrum; or equivalently, it can reduce infrastructure and spectrum spending each by 20% to produce the same capacity. The benefit of MNA is accessible - it does not require large separation distance between the transmitters belonging to different network operators, nor does it require many non-colocated transmitters. Moreover, colocation does not necessarily negate the benefit of MNA; they can be deployed together to achieve even greater cost efficiency.The economic impact of MNA on individual network operators is a result of both business decisions and technical parameters. When mobile network operators (MNOs) participate in MNA, the distribution of traffic volumes and the associated revenue among partner MNOs with MNA is not necessarily equal to that without MNA, and is not necessarily commensurate with the distribution of investment on infrastructure and spectrum resources among partner MNOs. There exists MNA arrangements that make all stakeholders, including consumers, better off; exactly how these benefits are distributed among all stakeholders comes down to negotiations.MNA-capable users can benefit from higher-layer protocols and features that enable the fast switching between networks without disruption to ongoing sessions and the better utilization of multiple networks. Flow-level migration allows fine-grained load balancing and QoS matching for multihomed devices running heterogeneous applications. Locators based on directed-acyclic-graphs allow quick response to link failure and enhances the resiliency of multihomed hosts and networks. Self-certifying identifiers facilitate authentication of migration signaling messages and helps reduce handoff latency.MNA already exists today in the form of a multi-operator mobile virtual network operator (MO-MVNO) like Google Fi, and there are signs of growing momentum in other forms such as through dual-SIM phones. The advent of 5G and network slicing thanks to software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) technologies will make MNA even more relevant in the future. MNA may have a profound impact on our wireless internet services by bringing a fundamental shift in control from service providers to end users. Consumers will no longer be limited by a single service provider in price, coverage, performance and customer service, and can always receive the service that best meets current needs. While practical barriers to MNA remain, the potential economic and social benefits provide strong incentives for its consideration.",1/22/20,5/20/25 15:32,5/20/25 15:32,5/20/25 15:32,,,,,,,Multi-Network Access,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/11568666.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/3BLQXM5E/Zhang - 2020 - Multi-Network Access How It Can Benefit Network Operators and Consumers Alike.pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The country is emblematic of this tension, having experienced more coups than any other country in the last century, yet also being considered one of the eight ""East Asian Miracles"" and a major destination for foreign direct investment. Through three papers, the thesis examines how businesses and governments can navigate political turmoil to enhance high-tech innovation. The first paper investigates why firms continue to invest in R&amp;D amidst political turmoil. The study uses a unique firm R&amp;D survey to explore this question and finds that R&amp;D investment may increase as it is flexible and redeployable once political uncertainty is more clarified. To further mitigate the risks from political uncertainty, firms invest their R&amp;D in functions that are more reversible and in sectors that have more potential returns from innovation. The second paper explores how multinational corporations (MNCs) adjust their innovation activities differently than domestic firms when their target country is facing turmoil. The study finds that although MNCs are associated with increased R&amp;D investment after the coup, their rate of associated increase is lower than that of domestic firms. MNCs from countries with more politically-oriented business cultures were also associated with less R&amp;D investment after the coup. The third paper explores how governments sustain and adapt the development of science and technology (S&amp;T) systems to political events. The study finds that officials are not just able to maintain public STI institutions, investments, and policies, but they are even able to enhance their efforts in certain instances. The study uncovers two key theoretical constructs that help explain this unexpected phenomenon: bureaucratic expansion and bureaucratic adaptation. Overall, this thesis identifies ways in which stakeholders in an innovation ecosystem can more effectively handle the challenges and opportunities presented by political transitions. It offers insights that can guide stakeholders in making informed decisions and taking calculated risks amidst such turmoil. This research can be particularly beneficial to economies that aim to emerge from the middleincome gap by leveraging science, technology, and innovation but face adverse conditions such as political uncertainty and violence. By providing a roadmap for how Thai stakeholders have navigated such challenges, this thesis can help Thailand and similar other economies unlock their full potential and achieve sustained growth and development.",2023,5/20/25 15:35,5/20/25 15:35,5/20/25 15:35,3147106 Bytes,,,,,,Navigating Political Change,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 3147106 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Organizational Behavioral Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, battery research focused on reducing the lifetime costs, manufacturing and waste impacts, and mining pressures associated with existing battery technologies are of utmost importance. To contribute to this effort, this dissertation delves into technological innovations at several key steps in the battery supply chain, from end-of-life assessment and reuse to raw material selection prior to manufacturing. Chapter 2 focuses on developing a holistic assessment of the state-of-health (SOH) of batteries after use in a hybrid-electric vehicle with the goal of selecting cells for reuse in a second-life application. Four hundred LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (LFP) cells were sampled from a retired hybrid-vehicle battery pack and tested using constantcurrent cycling, the current gold standard, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), a faster and cheaper alternative to cycling. In contrast to existing battery diagnostic studies, which only report cell capacity and resistance, this chapter analyzes correlations between battery diagnostic parameters, the spatial dependence of SOH within the pack, and correlations between cycling and EIS test results. We found that SOH variation within the pack is high in used EV packs, making it unfavorable to reuse them without refurbishment. We also found strong correlations between EIS and cycling tests under specific EIS test conditions, suggesting that low-cost, fast EIS tests are potentially valuable substitutes for cycling tests. Furthermore, using two distinct acceptance criteria, we estimated that 75% or 94% of modules and 90 or 99% of cells would likely be useful in second-life applications, respectively. Chapter 3 presents an assessment of the economic and technical feasibility of repurposing spent LFP cells based on the state-of-health insights from Chapter 2. We developed a model for investigating whether battery reuse can provide an economically sustainable solution to the problem of spent battery management while also addressing grid storage needs. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we probabilistically compared the pack lifetime, manufacturer revenue, and levelized cost of storage for end-users across two common battery chemistries—LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (LFP) and Li-Ni-Mn-Co (NMC)—within two applications—residential load-following and renewables firming. We found that LFP outperforms NMC in terms of revenue, enduser costs, and lifespan across various pack processing strategies. We also found that residential loadfollowing demonstrated superior revenue potential over renewables firming, despite the lower capital costs associated with the latter. Our results suggest that reusing entire packs might offer longer lifetimes and potentially lower costs for end-users than other strategies, but future research should study the safety implication of this method. However, pack sizing sensitivity analysis suggested that producing smaller packs drastically increased the optimistic estimates of lifetime. Chapter 4 focuses on recycling pathways for commercial batteries. In particular, we assessed the possibility of directly recycling LFP cathodes. We tested three types of cathode relithiation treatments—lithium iodide (LI), lithium hydroxide with citric acid, annealed (LHC), and lithium iodide, annealed (LIA). Cathode materials' crystal structure, morphology, composition, and electrochemical performance were characterized before and after relithiation. Based on insights from the LI and LHC methods, we developed the novel LIA method, which combines a galvanic relithiation process with a solid-state annealing process, yielding the best performance results for all states of health. In contrast, the LI method, which lacked a solid-state annealing process, restored the LiFePO<sub>4</sub> crystal structure of the harvested material but did not fully restore the characteristic electrochemical discharge profile of LiFePO<sub>4</sub>. The LHC method worked well on samples from two healthier cells but severely degraded the sample from the least healthy cell. We implemented a techno-economic analysis, which showed that LI and LIA relithiation are considerably more expensive than LHC relithiation due to the high cost of lithium iodide. However, all three relithiation methods were shown to be cost-competitive with LFP manufacturing for specific ranges in lithium replacement fractions. LHC relithiation was the lowest cost manufacturing process, with estimated breakeven recovery costs ranging from 5 to 30 USD per kg (10-61 USD per kWh) at 100% lithium replacement. Finally, Chapter 5 showcases an innovative alkaline MnO<sub>2</sub> cathode and electrolyte pairing. The system explored in this concluding project offers advantages in terms of lower costs, raw material abundance, enhanced safety, and comparable full-cell capacity to LFP. We found that electrochemical synthesis and cycling of layered MnO<sub>2</sub> (birnessite) can be improved using lower-cost NaOH electrolyte, which has not been studied in relevant existing literature, instead of the higher-cost KOH electrolyte, which has been repeatedly studied in existing literature. Furthermore, the birnessite cathode’s cycling stability was significantly improved in electrolyte-starved environments, demonstrating a stable capacity of approximately 400 mAh/g for over 400 cycles in NaOH. To our knowledge, NaOH and electrolyte-starved environments have not been studied in existing birnessite cathode literature. Thus, this study demonstrates essential directions for future research in improving the commercial viability of this low-cost, environmentally sustainable alternative to Li-ion batteries.",2023,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,11240642 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 11240642 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Materials Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improving technology forecasting is important because these forecasts are used by public and private decision-makers to inform decisions and create policies. Technology forecasts are intended to help decision-makers anticipate future events, avoid surprises, set priorities, and allocate resources effectively. To that end, technology forecasts should be both as accurate as possible and include uncertainty, so that decision-makers know how heavily to rely on them. However, when technology forecasts have been assessed retrospectively, they are often shown to not be very accurate. Generally, only people with expertise in engineering and technology are consulted when making technology forecasts. This dissertation describes the development and demonstration of an improved method of technology forecasting that includes consideration of policy, economic, and social factors that may affect how a technology develops. It is designed to help forecasters better imagine and think more systematically about factors beyond a technology itself that may shape its future. This dissertation provides evidence for the efficacy of this method of including policy, economic, and social factors in improving technology forecasting. The first chapter of this dissertation presents an overview of the few publicly available retrospective assessments of technology forecasts and recommends best practices for making such retrospective assessments. These best practices include making forecasts as specific as possible, including some measure of uncertainty in each forecast, and designing forecasts so they can be assessed retrospectively. I attempted to adhere to these best practices in the following two studies in this dissertation. The second chapter presents a pilot test of the proposed improved technology forecasting method that includes consideration of policy, economic, and social factors. A randomized controlled trial (n=133) was used to test the effectiveness of short briefings on reducing overconfidence in emerging automotive technology forecasts. The briefings warned participants to avoid overconfidence and encouraged them to think about how policy, economic, and social factors (such as government regulations, gasoline prices, and news coverage) may affect their forecasts. A retrospective assessment of the forecasts showed that the briefings reduced overconfidence in the forecasts. The third chapter is an application of the improved forecasting method to the future demand of power electronic applications in 2030 and which policy, economic, and social factors would be the most influential in determining that future demand. Fifteen experts were interviewed about the likely future demand of emerging power electronic applications (such as solar panels, transmission lines, and electric vehicles) with a focus on relevant policy, economic, and social factors (such as legislation, competitiveness, and public perception). The experts forecasted that electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, transmission, distribution, generation, ICT infrastructure, and the residential sector would have the highest future demand, approximately 2x-8x the demand today. The most influential policy, economic, and social factors on future demand were legislative action on climate change, the state of the global economy, sufficient resources, a reliable electric grid, public perception, and affordability",2023,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,14960877 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 14960877 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified; Public Policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first study (Chapter 2), “On the Implications of Using Composite Vehicles in Choice Model Prediction,” I investigated the issues of choice set representation in choice modeling methodology. I derived composite correction factors for logit-class models that can help reconcile differences in modeling results in composite-level and elemental-level models. I then demonstrated cases where correction factors may be useful. This contributed to an improved understanding of how competitor representation affects choice predictions. In the second study (Chapter 3), “Implications of Competitor Representation on Optimal Engineering Design ,” I investigated profit-maximizing engineering design models that integrate choice models for demand. Specifically, I studied how competitor representation can affect the trade-off between cost and benefit of design change. I derived a closed-form expression for the marginal cost and benefit relationship for the level of an attribute under optimal design assuming a latent-class or mixed logit (random-coefficients logit) demand model. I used this to characterize the impact of competitor representation in a case study of optimal automotive design. In the third study (Chapter 4), “The dynamic costs and benefits of a technology-forcing policy nested in a broader performance standard: the case of ZEV and CAFE,” I addressed the complexity of dynamic effects and nested policy interaction in automotive energy and environmental policy. I focus on two policies: Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandates and Corporate Average Fuel Economy / Greenhouse Gas (CAFE/GHG) standards.

This dissertation explores the institutional and innovation strategies that firms consider when governments regulate technology features in such nascent markets. This research looks at a global emerging market with multiple combinations of product features — the global commercial drone industry. Through this empirical context, this dissertation addresses three distinct questions: (1) how does government institutional support impact firm establishment? (2) how do institutional carriers impact the experimentation of product features? (3) how do regulatory standard changes impact the framing of new products? In Chapter 2, I study the infrastructure that can help explain the emergence of experimental markets (e.g., markets with both unclear institutional and technological trajectories). The Chinese commercial drone industry is an indicative example of such a market. I find that market-input infrastructure that clarifies the know-how needed for inputs has a greater association with upstream founding (component firms). Market-output infrastructure that clarifies market fit for resulting products has a greater association with downstream founding (end product firms). These effects are substitutive; local governments focus only on one of these forms of market infrastructure to reduce the risks involved in such experimentation and to reduce competition with other cities. Finally, institutional infrastructure that clarifies the rules increase founding, especially in cities with more aforementioned market infrastructure. In Chapter 3, I examine how formal standards (regulative institutional factors), industry consortia (normative institutional factors), and knowledge providers (cognitive institutional factors) interact to differentially impact observed firm product features. The drone industry around precision agriculture is a heavily regulated yet nascent market that serves as a useful context to explore the product innovation process. I test the interaction between these three institutional factors on product innovation using panel data of 464 newly introduced drone platforms targeted at precision agriculture sector that were released between 2000 to 2021. While regulatory standards do lead to convergence in product features, local institutional carriers play a key role in either enhancing or acting against such convergence. Firms located near industry consortia tend to experiment less and align with the emerging standard, whereas firms located near knowledge providers tend to experiment more and diverge from the emerging standard. While accounting for regulations is crucial, managers may find looking at how local institutional carriers respond to standard trends important in how they modulate product design choices. In Chapter 4, I investigate how firms navigate regulatory uncertainties in the U.S. consumer drone industry, where competing conventions co-exist: appropriateness vis-à-vis regulation vs. vis-à-vis market. Using 2,796 repeated observations of 466 small drones listed on the Amazon marketplace from 2013 to 2018, this study explores the impact of product framing strategies (framing to regulation, to market, or both) on product performance. The findings suggest that both framing around regulation and market have a positive effect on product market performance, but these effects are substitutive. Specifically, framing around regulation has a positive effect on market performance after a shift in regulation, while framing around market has a positive effect prior to the shift in regulation. By recognizing the impact of different framing strategies on market performance, entrepreneurs can gain valuable insight into when to pivot their product framing choices and product features in the face of regulatory uncertainty. The concluding chapter summarizes the findings of this dissertation and presents practical recommendations that emanate from these findings for regulators and managers seeking to adopt new technologies in the face of both market and regulatory uncertainty. Policymakers in such markets should consider more carefully the market nuances and tradeoffs when introducing regulatory standards. While introducing such standards can legitimize the market and promote entrepreneurship therein, these standards may also hinder subsequent product innovation in such a market. As such, policymakers need to be attuned to the stage of development in the market when pondering what standards to issue and when. Coordinating with local institutional carriers such as industry associations, national labs, science parks and universities specialized in certain domain knowledge could potentially mitigate these negative innovation impacts. On the other hand, firms need to consider the benefits and weaknesses of proximate institutional carriers in their location as they craft product design and market entry strategies. Additionally, the introduction of standards will influence the performance of different product framings, so firms need to adapt their framing strategies in ways that align with regulatory changes. <pre><code><br></code></pre>",2023,5/20/25 15:35,5/20/25 15:35,5/20/25 15:35,4479949 Bytes,,,,,,The Effects of Government Regulation on Entrepreneurship and Product Innovation in Nascent Markets,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 4479949 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As grid operators integrate these fundamentally different devices into the grid, there has been a paradigm shift in how they plan and operate the electrical grid. However, grid operators use traditional methods and generators to work around IBRs, rather than taking advantage of their operating capabilities. This thesis proposes solutions to three of the most pressing issues related to integrating IBRs into the electrical grid: voltage stability, frequency support, and transmission expansion. In Chapter 2, I evaluate whether solar photovoltaic (PV) inverters improve nighttime voltages on the grid and how much that operation costs compared to the traditional solution of installing voltage compensators, such as a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM). I find that nighttime voltages on the grid improve when PV inverters provide voltage support at night, reducing system costs by millions of dollars, or 4- 15 times less costly than installing a STATCOM. In Chapter 3, I examine if IBRs can provide fast frequency response (FFR) to support grid frequency and replace system inertia. I introduce an FFR requirement in a unit commitment and economic dispatch (UCED) model to assess the competitiveness of wind, solar, and battery storage in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) ancillary service market. I find that under low IBR penetration, an FFR requirement increases energy prices by 7%, but that cost goes down to zero under high IBR penetration. In Chapter 4, I investigate whether incorporating long-term load forecast (LTLF) uncertainties can affect the production cost savings differences of transmission expansion projects that accommodate more IBR penetration on the grid, which is a key factor in transmission expansion decision-making. I develop a distribution of LTLF errors for ERCOT’s eight regions that I use in an optimal power flow of a nodal ERCOT model to gauge the effect of LTLF uncertainties on production cost savings of three transmission expansion improvement options. The heterogeneity of the LTLF errors reduces the production cost savings differences between the three options by millions of dollars, making two of the options indistinguishable.",2023,5/20/25 15:35,5/20/25 15:35,5/20/25 15:35,4298768 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 4298768 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Electrical and Electronic Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the demand side, increasing temperatures may result in shifting electricity consumption patterns and increase need for energy. On the supply side, changes in air temperatures, water availability, and water temperatures could reduce the capacity and effi?ciency of thermal units, which currently represent 85% of generating capacity. Previous studies that analyze climate change effects in the power sector have mostly focused on analyzing these risks separately. Further, studies in the supply side risks usually looked only at eff?ects of climate change only in existing thermal generators. However, such studies fail to capture how these demand and supply risks interact with each other and with the operation of the power grid in general. In order to analyze these risks in more detail, it is important to integrate them into system-wide assessments. Such assessments should take into account theeconomic dispatch of the complete generator effect and future economic decisions to expand this effect. This dissertation attempts to understand how climate change will aff?ect the power sector in the U.S. We implemented an integrated framework where we use di?fferent modelingmethods to represent the diff?erent risks the power sector faces due to climate change. We used our modeling framework in a case study of the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), one of eight regional electric reliability councils under North American Electric Reliability Corporation authority (NERC). Firstly, we used an econometric model to estimate changes in hourly electricity demand due to climate change. We used this model to analyze changes hourly electricity demand patterns in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) region for diff?erent seasons of the year. Our results suggest that climate change could result in an average increase in annual electricity consumption in the TVA region. However, this increase was not uniformly distributed throughout the year. During summer, total electricity consumption could increaseon average by 20% while during winter it may decrease on average by 6% by the end of the century. Secondly, we combined the estimates of future hourly electricity demand described in Chapter 2 with simulations of decreases in available capacity of thermal generators due to climatechange. We integrated these simulations in a capacity expansion (CE) model. This CE model is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that we adapted and developed for this study. It fi?nds the composition of the future generator effect that minimizes costs subject to the estimated eff?ects of climate change. We ran this model under different climate change scenarios from 2020 to 2050. Our results showed that by including these eff?ects due to climate change in the decision making process, the estimated participation of renewables in the generator effect in 2050 increased from 24% to over 37{40%. Solar power plants could become more economically attractive. As they have higher energy output during the summertime, they could help to o?set the climate-induced loss of thermal capacity during this season because of higher air and water temperatures. Thirdly, we simulated the operation of SERC's power system assuming the diff?erent scenarios and generator effects presented in Chapter 3. To accomplish this, we used a unit commitment and economic dispatch (UCED) model. The UECD model is a mixed integerlinear programming (MILP) model that we adapted and developed for this study. We used this model to investigate the tradeo?s between investing or not in the generator effect assuming diff?erent climate change scenarios. Our results suggest that by not including climate change eff?ects in the planning stage, SERC's power system could experience loss of load levels of 12% and overall energy costs could be 260% higher if climate change conditions do materialize by 2050.",3/30/20,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,,,,,,,Effects of Climate Change on the Power System,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/12000888.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/8JEIKNE8/Ralston Fonseca - 2020 - Effects of Climate Change on the Power System A Case Study of the Southeast U.S..pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DMRRUEQ2,journalArticle,2023,"Tschofen, Peter",Essays in Pollution Accounting,,,,10.1184/R1/23563593.V1,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Essays_in_Pollution_Accounting/23563593/1,"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles smaller than 2.5 μm in diameter) air pollution poses a major risk to public health across the world. While the global burden of exposure to PM2.5 has remained persistently high, some regions – particularly in rich countries in the Western hemisphere – have seen more encouraging signs of progress in reducing impacts. This thesis documents some of this progress for the United States over the last 15 years (focusing primarily on PM2.5 with the exception of Chapter 2), and explores patterns that have started to emerge in more recent years that may inhibit further reductions or indeed point to a potential reversal in trends. In Chapter 1, the thesis provides a broad overview of sectoral contributors to monetized air pollution impacts, which we term gross external damage (GED), in the United States from 2008 to 2014. It notes trends such as the continuation of a steep decline in GED from the utilities sector as well as sectors such as manufacturing which exhibit modest increases in GED coinciding with the economic recovery after the financial crisis. The chapter also highlights that GED in the agriculture sector did not follow a comparable trajectory and instead remained largely stagnant over this time period. In addition to sectoral totals the chapter presents GED to value added (VA) at various sectoral scales. The damage intensities computed thusly provide an indication of a more accurate representation of economic performance because they account for environmental damage caused by economic activity.Chapter 2 expands on the work from Chapter 1 by incorporating GED from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and damages and updating the estimates to 2017. A modified sectoral categorization and the inclusion of residential activities and wildfires add more comprehensive estimates of the damages caused by human activities to the picture. GED from wildfires in particular (which are not only caused by humans) have increased substantially in recent years, and this trend has been especially pronounced in Western states. They now constitute a larger share of economy-wide GED than every economic sector, and recent evidence suggests that heavy wildfire seasons cause profound negative impacts to the United States economy. This chapter also argues strongly in favor of the power of regulation as a means to lower environmental impacts from economic activities. Sectors and pollutants that are tightly regulated, such as electricity generation or non-carbon pollutants emitted from transportation, are seeing the most success in lowering emissions and damages, whereas agriculture, a sector with precious few regulations on air pollutant emissions, is seeing hardly any progress. In some sectors (particularly in transportation), GHG GED are on an upward trajectory while GED from PM2.5 are falling, offering perhaps the clearest evidence of regulatory efficacy. The last chapter of this thesis provides detailed estimates of industrial GED within the agriculture sector at a national, state and metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level for 2011, 2014 and 2017. It improves upon the attribution method used to compute agriculture GED in Chapter 1 and thus provides more geographic and sectoral detail. Once again GED is compared with economic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) or VA, which adds nuance to the results. GED intensities by area differ significantly from GED compared to economic value. One key insight from this chapter is the strong concentration of agriculture GED from activities near population centers ¬ approximately half of all agriculture GED is a result of emissions that occur within the boundaries of metro areas. Overall, the thesis documents some encouraging trends in reducing the impacts from air pollution in the United States over the last decade and more, yet also identifies areas where progress has been mixed, muted, or even non-existent, and should therefore provide policymakers in the United States with useful information when it comes to designing the future regulatory framework for dealing with air pollution. <pre><code><br></code></pre>",2023,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,3386329 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 3386329 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The focus, however, has been on bands below 95 GHz, which is the current limit of near-future commercial technologies. As wireless markets continue to grow, demand may arise for spectrum in still higher frequency bands in the sub-millimeter or Terahertz (THz) bands between 275 GHz and 10 THz. THz spectrum offers a promising opportunityto explore an abundance of greenfield spectrum for a variety of future applications. However, the THz spectrum has many challenges associated with deployment, scalability, mobility, efficiency, and viable use-cases. In this thesis, we explore the need for moving to THz band and how multiple technical and policy tools can be used to improve efficient deployment for dense mobile indoor THz systems.Although the implementation of THz communications is nearly a decade away and at the frontiers of technical research, it needs immediate attention from the regulators,operators, manufacturers, and academia. It is worthwhile exploring how THz spectrum might impact wireless network architectures, business/usage cases, and spectrum policy. THz can effectively champion the NextGen communication, for which we propose a framework that can manage the tradeoffs among THz resources and allow us to monitor and allocate these resources more opportunistically. Terahertz Access Points (APs) are susceptible to parameters, such as environmental uncertainties and surface materials, relative location with user equipment(UE), AP and UE density, relative mobility with UEs, antenna gains, infrastructure, and a whole host of regulatory and standards constraints. Properly managing theseparameters will be of critical importance for enabling the use of this higher frequency spectrum. Moreover, in the future, densification, and heterogeneity of APs and UEs will only make the problem more acute. These THz systems will need proper planning and deployment of resources, using technical and public-policy tools, to improve the system performance effectively. Although THz has been envisioned to be deployed for static and nomadic users in an indoor environment, multiple factors, such as small-scale mobility, blockage, and inefficient deployment of resources, can still cause significant outages in the THz. In this thesis, we present a set of technical and policy approaches that can be used for modeling and efficiently deploying indoor THz systems. We address these challenges by presenting four approaches: (a) smart mobility management using machine learning algorithms, (b) analytical model for efficient (power, spectrum and cost) deployment of dense THz-APs, (c) extending user coverage for dense THz- UEs using device-to-device (D2D) communication, and (d) policy analysis for THz spectrum allocation and propose granular resource allocation strategies.",8/25/20,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/12860516.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/TTMAL8ER/Singh - 2020 - Indoor Mobility Management and Efficient Deployment in the THz.pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The uncertainty, complexity, and occasional novelty of complex and compound threats may necessitate adaptive capacity and adaptive decision-making at the individual and organizational levels. Adaptive capacity is defined as processes, actions, or outcomes in a system that facilitate coping, managing, and adjusting to changing conditions, stressors, or hazards. For both individuals and organizations, built and natural environmental conditions can influence vulnerability and adaptive capacity. This thesis explores the intersection of adaptive capacity and enacted adaptive decision-making and behaviors by considering both internal barriers and external stressors that challenge the willingness and ability to adapt to current threat landscapes. Adaptive capacity and adaptive decision-making are contingent on a variety of factors internal and external to individuals and organizations, such as knowledge and concern about threats and vulnerabilities, the willingness and ability to engage in proactive behaviors, and the capacity to change existing behaviors (i.e., emergent technology use). Examples of adaptive capacity assessed in the current thesis include individual-level use of multi-modal, sustainable transportation modes (Chapter 1), compound threat management strategies and constraints (i.e., incident prioritization, availability and use of emergent technology adoption, use of decision support tools) (Chapter 2), and compound threat resource allocation (Chapter 3). Both quantitative and qualitative data are used to assess adaptive capacity, including quantitative surveys, qualitative data from semi-structured interviews, and quantitative historical data records of natural hazards. This thesis emphasized the relationship between adaptive capacity and resource availability, particularly in the context of chronic and/or compound threats. Findings across the three analytical chapters suggest that the availability of and access to resources alone is insufficient in capturing individual and organizational adaptive behavior. In addition to tangible resources, psycho-social factors such as personal experience, competing objectives, and risk perception and communication can constraint adaptive capacity. Chapters 2 and 3 focus on challenges presented by a variety of compounding threats, which are anticipated to increase in frequency, severity, and complexity moving forward. Overall, results focus on U.S. adaptive capacity of communities and federal hazard management agencies, who serve to help communities prepare for, respond to, recover from, and adapt to stressors and disruptions in the natural and built environments. Findings from Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 suggest that it is critical to support the essential hazard management workforce to adapt to compound threat events, particularly given the resource constraints and mental health concerns discussed in Chapter 2 and resource use implications presented in Chapter 3.",2023,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,4483386 Bytes,,,,,,Explorations of Adaptive Resource Use and Technology Choice,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 4483386 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science; 50205 Environmental Management; FOS: Earth and related environmental sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
XLDJKQU7,thesis,2020,"Giordano, Alessandro",Environmental and Economic Prospects of Low-Carbon Vehicles in Support of European Commission 2030 City Logistics Fleet Goals,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Environmental_and_Economic_Prospects_of_Low-Carbon_Vehicles_in_Support_of_European_Commission_2030_City_Logistics_Fleet_Goals/13008338/1,"This thesis explores the operational feasibility, costs and benefits of replacing urban parcel deliveries operated by diesel vans with a diverse set of low-carbon vehicles. The aim is to facilitate the discussion among companies and policy makers on the health, environmental, economic and operational feasibility aspects of low-carbon vehicles, such as BEV vans, electric cargo scooters, and electric and human-powered cargo bicycles; and to produce actionable insights for their decision making on the inclusion of these vehicles in city logistics fleets. The analysis is carried under both private and public perspectives and for six specific European capitals (Berlin, Paris, Rome, Lisbon, Oslo and London), characterized by diverse size, weather, topography, infrastructure, and economic and social conditions. Because of these differences, the insights of this study are valuable to other cities within and outside Europe.The second chapter explores costs and benefits of BEV very large vans compared to their diesel equivalent, performing a life cycle assessment and an annualized cost comparison. Different battery technologies are included in the assessment and the outputs served to model small vans and air pollutant emissions from vehicle productions of low-carbon vehicles based on their weight and battery sizes.The third chapter assesses the effects of temperature on operational feasibility and costs of large BEV (and diesel) vans to make Chapter 2 results more robust. The study finds that the operational costs of diesel and BEV vans due to temperature effect are relatively small when compared to the overall operational costs. Even when including the purchase of dedicated charging stations, large BEV van operational costs remain 40 to 80% lower than for large diesel vans. However, pre-heating large BEV vans can reduce their range limitations in cold cities by 5-10%, 90-95% and 100% for 23.4, 46.8 and 70.2 kWh battery sizes, respectively, while it has a small or no value in warm cities.The fourth chapter then shifts the focus to deliveries performed by small diesel vans and assesses small BEV vans, electric cargo scooters and cargo bicycles’ ability to replace small diesel vans. It also explores the effects of weather and topographic factors, such as temperature, wind and city hilliness, on low-carbon vehicle technologies’ operational feasibility frontiers, expressed in terms of distance and load. Results reveal that the baseline fleet of small diesel vans, and therefore its delivery trips and mileage, can be entirely replaced by 36 kWh small BEV vans, while two-wheeled vehicles have a more limited potential. When multiple cargo bicycles and electric cargo scooters are used to replace diesel van trips, they could replace up to 28-63% of the baseline small diesel vans, with 0.4 average load factor, and 24-62% of the baseline fleet mileage, depending on the characteristics of the city.Across the topographic and weather factors affecting riders’ energy use, “hilliness intensity” and “average wind speed,” are the most relevant ones. The first of the two is predictable, however it could increase energy use considerably. Based on empirical cargo bicycle rides’ data, this study founds this effect varies from 0% in Berlin and London to 37% in Lisbon. Wind speed effect is less predictable daily and its effect on two-wheeled vehicles’ energy use varies between 1% and 22%. Hence, electric cargo bicycles in hilly and windy cities like Lisbon would require a set of three 1 kWh batteries to operate the same number of delivery trips that are operationally feasible for 1 kWh electric cargo bicycles in a flat city like Berlin. Furthermore, results reveal that cargo bicycle riders’ “type of diet” is critical to determine whether their deliveries have lower carbon footprint than electric scooters and small BEV vans. When food is considered, human-powered cargo bicycles’ GHG emissions are also larger than for electric cargo bicycle models.In the fifth chapter, private and external costs of different vehicle options are discussed to assess their cost effectiveness and inform the strategies, and policy incentives, delivery companies and European cities will need to achieve increasing levels of the European Commission strategic goal of “CO2-free city logistics,” with and without including cargo vans, by 2030.Results reveal that, low-carbon vehicles are either able to reduce air pollution but not congestion external costs (small BEV vans), or reduce air pollution and congestion external costs, but increase road accident costs (cargo bicycles and electric scooters). The study finds that cities can reduce their city logistics external costs including low-carbon vehicles in their fleets by up to 57% in Berlin, to 45-43% in Paris and Rome, respectively, and 31% in Lisbon, and that these percentages are achievable by prioritizing the inclusion of two-wheeled vehicle options in low-carbon vehicle fleets. In addition, policy makers could award financial or non-financial incentives to low-carbon vehicle options to make them more economically attractive than small diesel vans. These incentives would be justified by external cost savings, which vary across cities and could be up to 500-1,600 EUR/year for small BEV vans, 2,400-6,000 EUR/year for electric cargo scooters and 3,900-7,700 EUR/year for cargo bicycles, allowing low-carbon vehicle options can fully replace small diesel van delivery operations.The study concludes that the European Commission can achieve the 2030 “CO2-free city logistics” goal by a combination of cargo bicycles, electric cargo scooters and BEV vans, and that prioritizing the inclusion of two-wheeled vehicles maximizes cities’ external cost savings. Importantly, future research should include real driving-cycle and monitor operational data, such as load factors and parcel density information, of vehicle technologies in city logistics fleets to reduce energy use uncertainty and improve operational feasibility and external cost estimates.",10/2/20,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/13008338.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/T9K7JGHZ/Giordano - 2020 - Environmental and Economic Prospects of Low-Carbon Vehicles in Support of European Commission 2030 C.pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are three critical gaps in our understanding of how to meet these goals while upholding climate commitments. First, there is a need for high-resolution open-source models that provide a clear representation of who lacks access considering tier access levels in rural and urban East Africa. Second, we require a better understanding of the level of access countries aim to achieve and the resulting implications. Finally, as countries work towards achieving universal energy access targets in a carbon-constrained world, there is an opportunity to incorporate the demand for transportation services into energy planning efforts at an early stage. Addressing these gaps is crucial to creating effective policies that promote equitable access to clean energy sources and mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change in East Africa. This dissertation is motivated by the fact that inadequate data hinders the ability of stakeholders to make sound decisions at the national level regarding issues such as energy poverty. Chapter 2 of this dissertation introduces the first version of the Temoa East Africa model, offering a detailed parameterization of supply, electricity, building, and transport sector technologies, and includes carbon removal and hydrogen production pathways. The open-source model seeks to encourage further collaboration and sustainable energy planning in East Africa. Future work aims to incorporate more detailed transportation service demand data, electric vehicle charging station characterizations, and extended technology characterizations to the industrial and agricultural sectors. Concurrently, climate change is a reality, and there is an immediate and urgent call to reduce human-made emissions. Therefore, energy access goals must be met in a carbon-constrained world. Using the Temoa East Africa model, Chapter 3 examines the impacts of different energy access definitions on final energy consumption, least-cost technology mix, emissions, and costs by access tier group. The findings emphasize the importance of identifying obstacles and opportunities for each access tier to progress towards equitable energy access and low-carbon pathways, including policies that promote access to modern, efficient, and cleaner energy sources, particularly in rural households. The shift towards natural gas and electricity in higher access tier groups can facilitate progress towards a low-carbon energy system dependent on renewable energy and carbon removal technologies. Decentralized technologies such as off-grid solar PV will play a pivotal role in increasing electricity access to households in sparsely populated rural areas. Countries in Africa are not responsible for the vast majority of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, accounting for only 4% of cumulative emissions. Nevertheless, in the long term, continued reliance on fossil fuels and traditional biomass traps these nations, particularly the poorest in rural areas, in a continuous cycle of energy poverty. Chapter 4 develops a long-term land-based passenger and freight transport demand model to support open-modeling community efforts in developing countries, including East Africa. The findings suggest that middle-income countries in Asia, such as India and China, show the highest expected transport demand across all scenarios. Low-income countries in the sub-Saharan African region are likely to experience the largest growth in demand for passenger and freight transport services. Sustainably meeting this growing demand will require the adoption of data-driven transport planning tools and leveraging cross-linkages across other energy sectors, such as electricity. Overall, this dissertation provides valuable insights into sustainable energy planning in East Africa, highlighting the need for data-driven tools and policies that promote equitable access to clean energy sources while meeting clearly defined universal energy access targets. Achieving universal energy access goals that enable development while adhering to climate mitigation targets necessitates the use of open-source data-driven tools to aid country-level decision-making in East Africa. <pre><code><br></code></pre>",2023,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,10647562 Bytes,,,,,,Energy Access and Climate Mitigation,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 10647562 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed supply chain risks, production capacity, and recycling in use-case scenarios that varied battery chemistry and demand. We first analyzed tradeoffs between battery mineral supply chain risks and battery performance characteristics for global stationary storage. We compared electrochemical batteries, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), and found that lithium iron phosphate (LFP) generally has the fewest supply risks despite high material needs and low specific energy. LFP may be the most appealing choice for stationary storage installations where energy and power density are not essential. Our results indicate that supply chain risks for lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) 811 are similar to NMC 111. However, surprisingly, in our framework, the nickel in NMC 811 has more environmental impacts than the cobalt in NMC 111. Our research on global material production capacity for scenarios of LIB chemistry mixes and electric vehicle (EV) car deployments suggests that meeting global demand for refined cobalt may be challenging in 1 to 15 years, even under high production capacity levels. Class 1 nickel demand in EV cars may surpass production capacity in 15 to 20 years under average and high production levels. Our findings indicate that nickel composition in spent end-of-life (EOL) EV batteries in the U.S. will remain high relative to cobalt or lithium in the next 30 years, regardless of which battery chemistry becomes dominant in the market. High nickel content may alleviate recyclers' concerns about recent developments to swap out nickel- and cobaltconcentrated chemistries for LFPs. The mass of U.S. EOL battery materials in all scenarios surpasses our slow, medium, and fast growth cases for U.S. recycling capacity. The findings of this thesis are relevant to policies that aim to reduce long-term risks to battery materials.",10/31/22,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/21433038.v1,,"/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/2D8U63XU/Khan - 2022 - Analyzing Production, Recycling, and Supply Chain Risks for Battery Minerals in Electric Vehicles an.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, the power sector is one of the largest contributors to increasing GHG atmospheric concentrations, and there is a pressing need to decarbonize the sector. Unfortunately, emerging economies in the Global South, where most of the electrification needs to happen, are some of the most vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change. Therefore, to achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 7 of universal electricity access, emerging economies will need to expand their electricity infrastructure while cutting emissions and adapting to climate change. Hydropower may be a low-carbon option to increase supply and decarbonize electricity generation. Unfortunately, climate change can affect hydropower operations through changes in the timing and magnitude of precipitation, rising temperatures, and glacier mass. Evaluating climate impacts on hydropower generally requires detailed local input data and hydrological models, which may not be available in many places of the Global South. Nevertheless, there is a pressing need to understand these impacts for future planning decisions. Research that focuses on developing flexible data requirement tools and models able to use climate projections and remotely sensed datasets for data-scarce regions is needed. Furthermore, identifying climate impacts and their potential risks on hydropower plants is just the first step towards the future adaptation of the hydropower sector. Communicating assessment results to relevant decision-makers will be crucial, yet effective communication tools for climate adaptation are still lacking. The objective of this dissertation was to characterize and understand the impacts of climate change on usable hydropower capacity in the Global South. First, I developed a hydrological model paired with a hydropower operations model to assess usable capacity at the power plant level in data-scarce regions of the world. Then, I used the model to analyze the changes in usable capacity in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru under a multi-model ensemble. Later, I used the same model across five African power pools. I expanded the initial assessment to incorporate changes in variability of hydropower resources in Africa; and generate interconnection scenarios based on the complementarities of these resources. The final piece of this dissertation consisted of creating an interactive analysis tool that includes all previous assessments and incorporated 56 more countries across five regions of the Global South.",9/9/22,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,,,,,,,Hydropower Vulnerability in a Changing Climate,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/20750161.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/GF9AHX2E/Caceres - 2022 - Hydropower Vulnerability in a Changing Climate Characterizing Future Risks in the Global South.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Directed acyclic graphs (DAG), also called Bayesian networks, provide a natural way to conceptualize these systems. In contrast, regression modeling can provide strong evidence for the local, causal neighborhood of an outcome within the causal system, butproviding structure for the larger system is challenging with regression. Despite its value as exploratory data analysis or in conjunction with regression models to refine causal understanding, methods for estimating the causal structure underlying a dataset, causal discovery, are rare in fields such as epidemiology, possibly due to the difficulty handling data with continuous and discrete random variables.This thesis focuses on developing a causal discovery method for researchers whose data typically are comprised of both discrete and continuous variables. Its primarycontribution is the development of an estimator for graph divergence, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the full, joint distribution and the Bayesian factorizationindicated by a DAG. Graph divergence is a generalization of conditional mutual information: it quantifies the ?t of a DAG to the data, with greater divergence indicating worse ?t and a divergence of zero indicating a perfect characterization ofthe conditional independence relationships among the variables. Its nearest neighbor approach gives the estimator the capability to handle mixed data. We show that the estimator is consistent and its convergence separately for the continuous and discrete case under some assumptions.Last, we demonstrate a way to use graph divergence with a greedy Markov equivalence search algorithm in practice. Though this work is not complete, we estimate causal relationships between personal demographics, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis among men who have sex with men (MSM) on the American Men's Internet Survey data.

In the United States, there has been much debate on the merits and faults of increasing variable renewable energy, natural gas, and nuclear capacity; and because the depth to which all are willing to decarbonize is contested, direction from an overarching national policy is lacking. The absence of a formulaic policy offers the opportunity to explore fossil-fuel fleet reduction opportunities that do not advocate the wholesale replacement of the fleet with a zero-carbon technology, and allows for flexibility and the utilization of existing incentives to nudge the carbon-emitting fleet to emissions reduction. In this dissertation, I examine the role competing mitigation technologies under these conditions can play in decarbonizing the fossil-fuel fleet. To do so, I develop a tool for least-cost emission reductions, use this tool to quantify uncertainty and determine regret in the complex mitigation decision, and analyze the impact that the U.S. tax code has on this choice.",7/14/22,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,,,,,,,Marching to the beat of an absent drummer,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/20301786.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/99MMD5KT/Anderson - 2022 - Marching to the beat of an absent drummer Carbon Dioxide Emissions Reduction in the U.S. Power Sect.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To that end, there are over thirty countries around the world pursuing their first commercial nuclear power plants, and almost all will import their first reactors. The U.S. nuclear industry simply cannot compete with countries like Russia and China when it comes to exporting large light-water reactor (LWR) projects. Yet there is a boom of companies working on advanced nuclear technologies in the U.S., many aiming to be cost-competitive with fossil fuels. Someof these designs, particularly microreactors less than 10MW, could be demonstrated on much shorter timelines and at much lower costs than previously assumed, proving the technology domestically while also validating a potential export product. This thesis will investigate the nexus between these two emergent trends in the global nuclear industry: a shift away from the US as the dominant exporter and the implications for international security, andthe move toward smaller, factory-produced commercial nuclear reactors. In Chapter 2, I explore the role that nuclear exports have played historically in strengthening international nuclear material control regimes, and the implications of a decline in U.S. exports. I present results from a participatory expert workshop that evaluated policies that might be adopted to regain U.S. influence, including expanded U.S. exports of new nuclear technologies. However, the results from the workshop indicated that diplomatic strategies would be more feasible to implement over strategies that relied on a revitalized U.S. nuclearexport market. The experts concluded that advanced reactor technologies would not be commercially viable on relevant timescale. Yet recent policy and commercial developmentsuggest that microreactors could be commercialized on much shorter timelines. To understand the potential of these microreactors, in Chapter 3, I perform a technoeconomicevaluation of small-scale nuclear off-grid and community microgrid applications. I develop case studies for potential niche markets for the technology: two off-grid dieselivpowered Canadian communities, a large hospital in Alaska, and a college campus in Wisconsin. The results indicate that microreactors can be cheaper and more reliable comparedto 100% renewables systems, and they can also be cost-competitive with diesel where fuel costs are greater than $1/liter and the microreactor capital cost is less than $15,000/kW. However, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for microreactors is most sensitive to theinitial capital cost, and whether this technology will ever move beyond niche markets will depend on the learning effects accrued through factory fabrication. Thus, in Chapter 4 I will examine the hypothetical trade-offs between economies of scale and economies of volume for potential factory-fabricated microreactors. I calculate the break-even volumes necessary for microreactors to become cost-competitive with large reactors and with fossil fuels, using parameters from historic nuclear builds and analogousenergy technologies. Drawing from the literature on learning rates across energy technologies, I predict potential learning rates for various sized microreactors based on historical relations. Finally, I will outline some of the policy challenges of this new nuclear paradigm, along with areas for future study regarding the near-term deployment of microreactors.",12/17/20,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/13407836.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/V89WULM2/Lovering - 2020 - Evaluating Changing Paradigms Across the Nuclear Industry.pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This inconsistency leads toan investigation of how to evaluate accuracy in a field when gathering outcome data is expensive or only exists in the future (as is the case at the technical frontier). I prove bounds on expert accuracy that rely on response structure without requiring outcome data for validation.

The harm caused by social bots depends on their ability to avoid detection by credibly impersonating human users. These three studies use a signal detection task to compare human detection of Twitter social bot personas with that of machine learning assessments. Across these studies, we find that sensitivity was (1a) minimal without training or aid, (1b) people were hesitant to respond ‘bot,’ and (1c) people were prone to “myside bias,” judging personas less critically when they shared political views.

In years to come, stress arising from climate change, and the continuing risks of physical and cyberattacks on the system, will likely make resilience even more important. However, while the topic receives a great deal of attention, there is little rigorous analytical work that has assessed the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of strategies to increase power system resilience. This research adopts a mixed methods approach to identify and assess strategies for improving the resilience of power systems and thus enhance planning as the power system evolves. Chapter 2 begins by reviewing a range of resilience strategies discussed in the literature that could be deployed on the grid. The literature on this subject is scattered and unsystematic in its treatment of cost and efficacy. This chapter contributes to the resilience literature by developing a comprehensive list of strategies and summarizing what is known about their costs and efficacy. Chapter 3 has already been published in the journal Risk Analysis. It analyzes and compares a range of individual and collective strategies that could increase the resilience of power supply to residential customers on a distribution feeder by providing contingency power during large power outages of long duration. A typical (but hypothetical) town in the Upper Connecticut River Valley is modelled—we choose this region because it is susceptible to ice storms and hurricanes—to estimate the cost and performance of different resilience strategies, assuming that a large power outage of long duration occurs. This work showed the extent to which collective strategies are cheaper, and therefore highlighted the importance of developing institutional arrangements that make it easier for communities to implement those collective strategies. Chapters 4 and 5 present the first systematic analysis of empirical data about the efficacy of different resilience strategies. To do this, Chapter 4 focuses on the state of Florida, which has required utilities to make substantial investments in storm hardening to improve the resilience of their systems in the face of tropical cyclones. While these utilities compile and report to the state Public Service Commission a phenomenal amount of data on the cost and performance of their different resilience strategies, almost no analysis has been done on these data to assess whether and to what extent these investments are actually improving the power system’s resilience. After compiling fifteen years’ worth of these data for Florida’s Investor-Owned Utilities, the exploratory data analysis shows that after accounting for tropical cyclone severity, undergrounding power lines, changing pole material to non-wood and installing advanced metering infrastructure across all customers likely improve average tropical cyclone restoration time (CAIDI). Increasing annual tree trimming on the other hand does not seem to have an impact on tropical cyclone CAIDI. However, to continue performing at current levels of reliability, these utilities will have to spend more on the same activities and even more on others to continue to address the impacts of climate change and the uncertainty they induce. Informed in part by this applied data analysis, in work reported in Chapter 5 utility engineers were interviewed to extract their mental models of power system resilience, as well as their judgments regarding how to enhance resilience most effectively given the range of threats facing their systems. Operators were asked to consider the worst outage their system had experienced and then to elaborate on how implementing resilience strategies could have improved their response to this worst outage without financial barriers. Undergrounding power lines was the preferred strategy by interviewees, but also estimated to be the most expensive. Finally, participants were asked what technologies, policies and resources are especially needed by utilities to enhance their systems’ resilience, and they suggested new rate designs to account for an increase in renewables, distributed energy resources, and electrification as well as defining new policy standards for new loads and distributed generation being added to their systems. They were additionally concerned with supply chain backlogs and having enough money to do the necessary upgrades on an aging system.",2023,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,6715617 Bytes,,,,,,Investing in Power System Resilience,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 6715617 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,"160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science; FOS: Earth and related environmental sciences; 40104 Climate Change Processes; 90699 Electrical and Electronic Engineering not elsewhere classified; FOS: Electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substantial electrification of road transport is critical to deep decarbonization. Self-driving technology continues to inch towards wider commercial deployment, despite well-publicized setbacks. Policymaking must grapple with a deeply uncertain technology landscape and trade-offs between multiple societal objectives. I attempt to help inform public policy by carefully navigating the uncertainty present in the deployment of these technologies and highlighting how trade-offs between multiple objectives might materialize. First, I look at the potential energy impact of automation on electric vehicle range. Will electrification and automation of light vehicles develop in sync? I find that automation will incur expected penalties of 10-15% on electric vehicle range, due to the energy consumption of computing and sensors. This suggests that deliberate technology choices towards efficient computing and aerodynamics will be needed to drive electrification of automated vehicles. In long haul trucking, I investigate the potential job impacts from automation of highway driving. I draw on detailed shipment data to show that replacing all highway driving with automated trucking will lead to more than 90% of operator-hours lost to automation. I find limited evidence to support industry claims that increased short haul jobs will compensate for the operator-hours lost on highways. Third, I present a novel agent based model that can answer a series of research questions related to electric vehicle deployment in ridesourcing. Companies such as Uber and Lyft have committed to fully-electrify their fleets by 2030 in the United States. Should policy incentivize larger battery pack sizes or greater investments in dedicated fast-charging infrastructure for ridesourcing? I instantiate the agent based model to study the lifecycle externalities of fully-electric ridesourcing in the city of Chicago, across different levels of battery size and fast-charging infrastructure. I estimate that greenhouse gas externalities are in the range of 10-13¢ per trip, with lower externalities associated with smaller battery packs. Compared to today, fully electrifying ridesourcing can cut greenhouse gas externalities in Chicago by 50-60%. Solely targeting reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, however, comes at the cost of increases in traffic externalities such as congestion",2023,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,8318821 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 8318821 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science; 99999 Engineering not elsewhere classified; FOS: Other engineering and technologies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the hands of practitioners and policy-makers, behavioral interventions are a tool which can be used to potentially reduce the complexity of privacy decisions for users, leading to better outcomes. This dissertation explores the application of different behavioral interventions to contexts currently unexplored in the literature and examines whether they can be made more effective. In addition, this dissertation contributes to policy discussions regarding behavioral interventions for privacy decisions by examining how data protection regulation has impacted the presence and strength of behavioral interventions on websites. In Chapter 2 of this dissertation, I present the results of three online experiments aimed at investigating whether nudges (a type of behavioral intervention) tailored to various psychometric scales can influence participants’ disclosure choices. Across each of these experiments, we do not find significant effects robustly linking any of the measured psychometric variables to differences in disclosure rates. In Chapter 3, I examine whether providing explanations (a different type of behavioral intervention) for recommendations about hypothetical privacy decisions impacts the rate at which participants adopt the recommendations. The results do not find strong evidence linking the tested explanations to hypothetical adoption intent. Across both chapters, I describe the study designs and contextualize the null results, drawing lessons about the robustness of behavioral interventions in the context of real user behaviors. In Chapter 4, I leverage longitudinal data from a large panel of websites to investigate the dynamics of privacy notice design over time in order to comment on the potential impacts of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation on the presence and strength of behavioral interventions within privacy notices. The results identify geographic disparities in the prevalence of privacy notices in the US compared to the EU.

Imperfect adherence decreases the average outcome effects measured during clinical trials and observational studies. Many methods exist to measure adherence which differ in their accuracy and costs, depending on the type of intervention. Study designs improve adherence through reminders to participants or evaluation during a run-in period. Analysis methods can account for imperfect adherence, but they vary in terms of the statistical assumptions required and the potential bias that each introduces. This dissertation applies decision science principals to create recommendations addressing how adherence should be measured, analyzed, and reported for future studies. Decision scientists can fill many roles in terms of informing policy analysis. Three roles addressed by this dissertation include (a) translating human behavior into analytic terms, (b) treating analysis as human behavior, and (c) facilitating two-way communication between experts and lay people. Chapter two addresses (a) by using a simulated clinical trial of a common hypertension drug in order to inform when collecting adherence information could be beneficial to researchers. The trial evaluates two trial designs, a randomized controlled trial with and without an enrichment period, and two analysis methods, intent-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis. This simulated trial finds that the costs of using a less pragmatic study design or more biased analysis method does not outweigh the benefits of the monetary savings that these approaches provide. Chapter three addresses (b) by evaluating how imperfect adherence is accounted for by researchers of software as medical device (SaMD) apps. The chapter uses normative criteria from the literature to evaluate how researchers measure and analyze adherence information. Our review finds that the majority of trials imperfectly reported adherence metrics (63%) and did not use an appropriate method to evaluate efficacy (75%). Future SaMD trials could be improved by reporting all facets of adherence, preregistering efficacy analyses, and using less biased analysis methods. Chapter four continues to address (b) by applying the recommendations found from Chapter three to evaluate the MyHealthyPregnancy (MHP) app. The MHP app collected observational data between September 2019 and February 2022. Metrics of each facet of usage find that usage of the MHP app during the study was very low. For example, the majority of participants used an app activity less than three days throughout the trial. An evaluation of the average treatment effect finds no evidence that the MHP app is effective at increasing gestational age at birth or reducing preterm birth risk. Analyzing the dose-response effect for app usage finds that increased use is correlated with increased gestational age at birth. The interpretation of this finding is limited by our knowledge of confounders and low usage of the app by study participants. In the future, studies could be improved through a randomized trial design and increased app usage. The sum of this work has identified many gaps between how researchers are currently accounting for imperfect adherence and how they could address this source of bias in the future. Researchers would benefit from measuring adherence both in terms of how users interact with an intervention and how they interact with recommendations from the intervention. They would also benefit from measuring and reporting on all facets of adherence. Analysis of adherence could be improved through the preregistration of efficacy analyses and more careful consideration of the confounders that could affect these analyses. Regulators could support these changes by creating clearer guidelines for accounting for imperfect adherence and more strict requirements for the preregistration of observational studies.",2023,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,1492159 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 1492159 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/YAZZWNQW/Grayek - 2023 - A Decision Science Approach Towards Improving the Study of Adherence Information.pdf,,,160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science; FOS: Mathematics; Statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation conducts four categories of analysis on how electricity market design can be modernized to increase efficiency and avert roadblocks to economy-wide deep decarbonization. First, electric utilities can capture most of the system benefit of customer-sited energy storage resource (ESR) adoption with critical peak pricing (CPP). CPP is proposed as a simple and Pareto-improving rate design for commercial and industrial customers with ESRs, similar to time-of-use rates for electric vehicle owners. Second, previous research quantifying correlated generator failures in the PJM Interconnection canbe incorporated in both resource adequacy and scarcity pricing using an operating reserve demand curve (ORDC). Because correlated failures occur at very high and low temperatures when electricity demand is highest, there are substantial effects on target winter and summer planning reserve margins and increased social welfare from better accounting for generator failure probability when designing ORDCs. Third, as electricity markets evolve toward higher shares of variable, low marginal cost resources with ESRs new rules are needed to ensure resources’ full, competitive participation. A bi-level model implemented on a realistic, high renewables nodal test system highlights strategiesESRs and hybrids can use to raise prices, particularly cross-product and decongestion strategies, and suggests offer uniformity over co-optimized temporal intervals as a remedy. Fourth, metrics like effective load carrying capability (ELCC) are increasingly common for quantifying the system dependent contribution of variable generation and ESRs to resource adequacy. Extending these methods to a zonal evaluation of resource adequacy using data from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) shows transmission and ESRs have a complementarity benefit in zonal resource adequacy that is not realized by variable nor conventional generators, suggesting the importance of increased zonal representation in planning with ESRs.",2/18/22,5/20/25 15:38,5/20/25 15:38,5/20/25 15:38,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/19147811.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/YQCRSRBM/Lavin - 2022 - Data and technology-driven improvements to electricity market design.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, an evaluation of different decarbonizing strategies across nations is missing in the literature. This dissertation consists of two methodologically distinct but related studies looking at the environmental, climate, and public health impacts of freight transportation. In the second chapter, I look at these impacts in the context of ocean shipping in India and explore the emissions reduction potential of shore power in India. However, given how dirty and emissions-intensive India’s electricity generation currently is, I show that shore power is not a cost-effective strategy to reduce air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions in India. In the third chapter, I evaluate freight trucking pollution impacts across the contiguous United States and the implications of trucking pollution on minority group populations. Based on my analysis, I find that the environmental and climate social costs due to freight trucking in the US result in ~$17B in environmental damages and ~$25B in climate damages, respectively. Further, more trucking pollution occurs in counties and census tracts with a higher proportion of Black and Hispanic populations.

However, obstacles like stigma and limited access to qualified providers mean typical screening procedures do not catch every occurrence. As patient-generated text becomes more common, natural language processing techniques can estimate semantic content like affect in writing, opening another route to risk detection. This thesis identi?es methods to supplement traditional risk detection procedures like self report measures and discussion with clinicians with computational analysis of reflective written language. I apply natural language processing techniques to extract information like emotional or thematic content from people's writing, then customize and train models to estimate writers' psychosocial risks. Two of the studies additionally present methods for elicitation of original data for this purpose, with both datasets coming from pregnant and postpartum respondents. Computational risk detection models could expand the scope of mental health screening beyond doctors' offices and formalized measures to anywhere a person in need of help decides to reach out.

Chapter 2 quantities the effects of I/M programs on road fatalities by applying panel specifications to a data set covering all 50 U.S. states over a 44-year period. Fixed effects (FE) estimates suggest that states with I/M programs had 5.5% fewer roadway fatalities per 100,000 registered passenger vehicles each year. A supporting two-stage least-squares (2SLS) specification also implies causality. Chapter 3 proposes transparent models to identify over-emitting vehicles, using only data which may be collected over-the-air through telematics systems. These modelswere up to 24% more accurate than the current test methodology, in a stratified data sample. These statistical models are a proof-of-concept for I/M programs where jurisdictions may remotely identify over-emitting vehicles, without requiring a physical inspection. Chapter 4 breaks down the annualized user costs of emissions inspection programs. An assessment of data from Pennsylvania finds that in 2016, the average user cost was $56 per vehicle—which includes $44 in test fees, $3 in repair costs, and $9 in indirect costs. Further, the results show that costs vary substantially: that on average, older vehicles have lower test fees but higher repair costs, and that vehicle owners in neighborhoods with lower median incomes or more minority residents may pay more in test fees and repair costs. The proliferation of telematics, driver assistance technologies, and electric vehicles is ushering in an era of ‘intelligent’ transportation systems. As modern vehicles rely on increasingly large amounts of data, this dissertation presents a case for why the regulations and policies governing their inspection and maintenance, may be improved by leveraging data-driven assessments and models.",7/8/22,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,,,,,,,"Effective, Fair, and Over-the-Air",,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/20110292.v1,,"/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/PYJTSXFG/Acharya - 2022 - Effective, Fair, and Over-the-Air Data-driven policy recommendations for passenger vehicle inspecti.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, chemical transport models (CTMs) can help evaluate scientific understanding of UFPs and quantify human exposure.In this work, we deploy a state-of-the-science CTM, PM-CAMx-UF at high resolution (1 km) over Pittsburgh in winter and summer to simulate UFP concentrations and explore the model’s ability to resolve intraurban spatial and temporal variability in UFP concentrations. We evaluate model predictions against an extensive intraurban network of ~30 long-term UFP and ~50 other pollutant observations sites. Simulations quantify the sources of UFPs within an urban area, and we assess the value-added from increasing model resolution to 1 km. Model inputs include particle number emissions derived from source-specific particle size distributions. Moreover, for traffic sources, we derive spatially resolved emissions from a traffic model for Pittsburgh.Baseline simulations for February and July 2017 indicate predicted particle number concentrations (PNC) in Pittsburgh vary by more than a factor of two at 1-km resolution, with similar levels of intraurban and urban-rural variability in both winter and summer. Comparisons to a network of 27 long-term (~1 month) winter observation sites in Pittsburgh show model spatial agreement with MFB = -42% and MFE = 42% with better agreement at local road or urban background sites than sites impacted by local sources or topography. Temporally, the model matches winter diurnal variability in PNC at 12 sites with r2 values of monthly average observations and predictions exceeding 0.28 spread across all site types.

Hydrogen has emerged as a promising part of a portfolio of solutions, with the potential to offer a clean alternative for various sectors such as transportation, industry, and power generation. However, integrating hydrogen into the existing energy infrastructure presents challenges, including issues of cost competitiveness, achieving clean production with very low leakage, public understanding and acceptance, and ensuring a reliable supply chain. All of these challenges underscore the complexities involved in the deployment and adoption of a transformative technology within energy and infrastructure systems. Currently dozens of pilot projects, designed to jumpstart the production and use of hydrogen and demonstrate its large-scale application in the energy mix, are being planned and developed across the United States. While achieving, or at least providing a pathway to, cost competitiveness is a key market-based objective for these projects, identifying and overcoming non-economic challenges will be at least as important to ensuring the successful development of a hydrogen market. This dissertation contributes to the understanding of barriers and opportunities associated with the widespread use of hydrogen technologies in the United States today. It applies both qualitative and quantitative methods to (1) evaluate barriers identified across published national hydrogen roadmaps, as well as stakeholder views on non-economic barriers the hydrogen market is currently facing in the US; (2) gain a more nuanced understanding of the public perception of hydrogen and hydrogen hubs; and (3) provide a comparative lifecycle assessment of the envi?ronmental impacts that various regions of the US will face in establishing hydrogen production facilities. The results advance the understanding of current opportunities in the integration of hydrogen into the clean energy sector and provides actionable guidance to aid decision-makers and stakeholders in the development and implementation of the U.S. Hydrogen Roadmap. Results and insights from this dissertation can be summarized as follows. Global barriers to hydrogen development, as identified in existing national hydrogen roadmaps, were shown to be infrastructure development, market development, and the need for research and development. Domestically, providing regulatory clarity and addressing decision makers’ lack of awareness were the two non-economic barriers that stakeholders identified as being the most impactful to hydrogen technology deployment today. Additionally, public perception of hydrogen resulted vi in surprisingly disparate views between industry and government employees – suggesting an opportunity for these groups to work together in addressing this barrier. To address public perception, private and public sectors should work together to develop balanced messages and address the public’s desire for additional information. Specifically, leak detection and safety considerations were top concerns for participants in the focus group participants in the Southwest Pennsylvania case study. Lastly, as regulatory policies are proposed and refined, incentives need to be carefully designed to ensure developers’ process designs and investments achieve the low?carbon goals of hydrogen technology. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, while no single variable can result in increasing a developer’s clean energy tax credit eligibility, the electricity grid mix provided the largest impact independently to emissions.",2025,5/20/25 15:39,5/20/25 15:39,5/20/25 15:39,10789442 Bytes,,,,,,Beyond the Bottom Line,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 10789442 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering; Other engineering; Other engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rare opportunity to redefine emergency preparedness has been created by the ongoing work at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop the capability to address small modular reactors and other new technologies and to transition to a risk-informed performance-based regulatory structure. This dissertation develops a new framework for emergency preparedness that can address the characteristics of new reactor technologies while also addressing the limitations of current methods. A review of the literature, current regulations, and methods identifies gaps and limitations. Statistically valid methods are defined to enable new analysis of uncertainty and use cases in limited regulatory validated computer codes. A new interdisciplinary framework for emergency planning is developed to reduce the barriers present in current methods, then a risk-based model that integrates protective action and hazard dispersion models is defined. This integrated model considers the risk caused by multiple hazards, including radiological and transportation hazards. The interdisciplinary and integrated structure of the model provides the opportunity for new measures of effectiveness that provide additional insights beyond existing metrics.The integrated model is used to evaluate emergency response at the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station as a case study. The key findings of this case study provide insight into effects previously not discussed in nuclear power emergency planning studies. The ability to compare protective actions across multiple metrics allows for risk and consequences-based evaluation and provides more information for decision-makers. When combined dose and non-dose risks are considered, many historically common protective action strategies become inadvisable by creating more combined risk than taking no action. Even small amounts of time between initiating a protective action and the release of radiation can potentially result in a substantial reduction of consequences. The behavior of the population has a large impact on consequences but is not sufficiently captured in prior studies.",2/9/22,5/20/25 15:39,5/20/25 15:39,5/20/25 15:39,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/19115987.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/WMI86W3Z/Stein - 2022 - An Interdisciplinary Decision Framework for Risk-Based Nuclear Power Plant Emergency Planning and Pr.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A substantial literature on international talent flows documents how the supply of foreign students to U.S. schools has changed over time, and the causal implications thereof. However, scholars have primarily focused on understanding the flow of students to U.S. graduate education programs—PhD programs in particular—ignoring the largest group of international students in the United States: undergraduates. In this study, the author leverages data from the Institute of International Education (1997-2018), the Chinese Ministry of Education (1996-2018), and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (2005-2018) to determine the proportion of Chinese undergraduate students enrolled at U.S. HEIs. The author finds that while the proportion of Chinese undergraduate students enrolled at U.S. HEIs (all fields) rose from 2008 to 2017, the proportion of engineering students only rose until 2014, after which it stagnated. In contrast, the proportion of Chinese undergraduate students enrolled in U.S. social science programs increased over the entire period (2008-2017). The causal factors behind the 2008 increase in overall Chinese student enrollment in the U.S. are difficult to determine due to the simultaneous increased affordability of U.S. higher education (due to rising Chinese household incomes and appreciation of the Yuan) and loosening U.S. immigration policies (specifically a U.S. June 2005 extension of Chinese students’ visa validity from six months to one year). Further research is needed to understand why the proportion of Chinese undergraduates enrolled in U.S. engineering programs stagnated while the same proportion for social sciences has continued to rise. Explanations might include field-specific discrepancies with respect to job market access and salaries in China or that students in social sciences are disproportionately attracted to the open academic environment at U.S. HEIs.",10/1/21,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:43,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/16725427.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/VPTK9BSH/Feldgoise - 2021 - Who Trains the Future.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Industrialized countries’ food and energy systems face the threat of unsustainable practices and competition for resources from multiple productive sectors. Meanwhile, the least developed countries struggle with inadequate access to modern agricultural, water, and energy technologies to provide food efficiently and securely. This thesis aims to identify and quantify food production impacts on energy and water consumption via case studies in the United States and East Africa. In both cases, I use integrated biophysical models to estimate the effects of food production (e.g., chicken broiler meat and irrigated crop yields) on energy and water resources consumption using climatological data inputs. For the case study in East Africa, I also assessed the financial viability of pressurized irrigation on a subnational level. Findings suggest that projected future climate change temperatures by mid-century will increase energy demand for cooling, reduce energy demand for heating, and substantially increase water withdrawals for evaporative cooling for industrial chicken broiler production in the Eastern U.S. The results for the case in East Africa indicate that the techno-economic potential of small-scale pressurized irrigation is highest for horticulture, maize, and potato crops grown with improved seeds and at least moderate fertility levels. My results suggest that food production impacts on energy and water demand are climate and site (or geography) dependent. These factors' relative importance depends on operational practices (e.g., input selection), technology types and costs, and fuel prices.",2022,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:43,5537831 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 5537831 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,90799 Environmental Engineering not elsewhere classified; FOS: Environmental engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These consequences and perceptions have important policyimplications, ranging from potentially billions of dollars in societal costs that depend on credit card reissue decisions to the perceived fairness of sentences imposed on people convicted of cybercrimes. I analyze these consequences and perceptions using a combination of legal, empirical economic, and criminological analyses. First, this work analyzes at the economics of credit card reissue after a data breach. Using a parameterized estimation model based on publicly-available information, it compares the cost ofreissuing cards to the total expected cost of fraud if cards are not reissued. The model suggests that automatically reissuing cards may have lower social costs than the costs of waiting until fraud is attempted, although the range of results is considerably broad. The results also show how alack of quality public information about data breach and identity theft can make informed public policy decisions more difficult. Second, it explores a potential misalignment between the factors that contribute to cybercrime sentences and the importance of those factors in public perceptions. It presents the results of two empirical studies that measure public perceptions of different factual attributes ofcybercrime. The studies show that Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) sentences are indeed out of alignment with the public’s views and provide empirical support for arguments that CFAA sentencing is miscategorized in the federal sentencing guidelines. Third, it addresses the question of whether CFAA subsection (a)(2), coveringunauthorized access to a computer to obtain information, should be considered a trespass, burglary, or fraud statute. It does this through an analysis of case records and sentencing data from 1,095 real-world CFAA sentences, and an experimental study of perceptions of 499 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The results of both studies suggest that (a)(2) is not like trespass or fraud, at least in terms of current punishments or perceptions, and lend support to arguments that CFAA sentencing should be covered under its own section of the sentencing guidelines.",9/28/21,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:43,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/16679617.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/EKLNISHU/Graves - 2021 - Empirical Analyses of Effects and Perceptions of Cybercrime.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This increases the complexity of the decision-making process, requiring interventions that can help groups tradeoff multiple objectives and avoid suboptimal decisions. I focus on two critical problems faced by groups of system designers that have been incompletely explored in behavioral and decision science domain: generating efficient designs and reaching group consensus. I develop and test two classes of behavioral interventions to address these problems: real-time feedback and consensus-driven group recommender systems. Although these have the potential to help groups generate better designs and reach consensus, they lack quantitative evidence of their effectiveness and feasibility to improve group decision-making processes in techno-economic analyses. The objective of this thesis is to provide quantitative evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of those interventions using behavioral experiments in a laboratory setting. I achieved these objectives by recruiting a wide range of participants (students, laypeople in the general public, experts in an emerging technology), organizing them into groups, and evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of the interventions on helping them to improve their decisionmaking in three different techno-economic areas.

YAMRFHAI,thesis,2021,"Tyagi, Aman",Challenges in Climate Change Communication on Social Media,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Challenges_in_Climate_Change_Communication_on_Social_Media/14877105/1,"In today’s fast-paced lifestyle, internet users depend on social media platforms to obtain and debate essential socio-political and economic topics. However, this same vital source suffers from various challenges. On social media platforms, such as Twitter, users do not necessarily face a lack of information; instead, they are overwhelmed with diverse information sources. These myriad sources of information on social media can make users unknowingly confined to or associated with other users or groups. Moreover, facts or news can be reported in ways that createconfusion and affect public sentiment on scientific actualities. Such social media challenges can cause a long-lasting impact in reshaping our society, slowing downscientific progress, and dampen regulatory endeavors. Thus, social media’s impact on socio-political and economic topics must be analyzed. In this thesis, I analyze each of these problems using conversations and news articles about one of the most significant challenges our society faces today, i.e., climate change. In my first study, I analyze climate change discussions on Twitter to study users confined to competing belief groups. I classify Twitter account users into: (a) users who believe in the anthropogenic cause of climate change (Believers); and (b) users who don’t (Disbelievers). I study the differences in communication topics and network structure in Disbelievers and Believers. I find that both Disbelievers and Believers talk within their group more than with the other group; this is more so thecase for Disbelievers than for Believers. In my second study, I develop a framework to quantify hostile communication between Believers and Disbelievers. I show that Disbelievers of climate change are more hostile towards Believers than vice versa. I examined the framing bias of climate change news articles shared on Twitter as partof my third study. I find that climate change news articles are predominantly framed as related to policy issues in the context of a social group’s traditions, customs, or values. Finally, I explore the spread of conspiracy theories in climate change conversations on Twitter. Results suggest that Disbelievers are primarily responsible for sharing messages that contain keywords related to conspiracy theories. Overall, my work in this thesis develops frameworks to analyze social media challenges and contributes to climate change communication research.",7/7/21,5/20/25 15:44,5/20/25 15:44,5/20/25 15:44,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/14877105.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/GHWSQZ4E/Tyagi - 2021 - Challenges in Climate Change Communication on Social Media.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first part of this thesis looks at nuclear energy in the U.S., while the second part examines the pursuit of decarbonization through decentralized micro-grids.The thesis begins by examining the possibility of a U.S. domestic market for factory-manufactured small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) being developed through the use of hybrid water-energy systems. This work found that the use of the proposed hybrid system will not likely lead to the mass market needed to facilitate the mass manufacturing of SMRs. On the electricity side, these hybrid systems powered by SMRs are not cost competitive in the U.S. against similar low carbon technologies like natural gas equipped with carbon capture and sequestration (NGCCS). On the water side, I conclude that the need for water desalination over the next several decades in the U.S. will not be large enough to support the mass SMR market I was searching for. However, there might exist substantial markets in arid countries where natural gas prices exceed 12 $/mscf and where there is a strong desire to adopt nuclear power.Chapter 3 investigates the perceptions of nuclear power as supported by existing theories on differing nuclear perspectives. Our survey participants held significantly less favorable views about nuclear energy if they cited Chernobyl and Fukushima as noteworthy events that shaped their perception. I found that Chernobyl has the most negative impact on participants, even for those who were not alive for the event. There was also a significant increase in negative views of nuclear energy in participants who would have been between the ages of 20 to 30 years old during Chernobyl, but these results do not extend to other events like Fukushima. The survey results also suggested that participants who are both non-white and non-male held significantly less favorable views compared to white males.Chapter 4 examines the trade-offs between decentralization and decarbonization in microgrid planning. A trade-off curve is produced by using a previously developed mixed-integer program (DER-CAM) in a multiobjective programming framework. The results include a range of microgrid designs with different technology mixes or typologies. As the weight on greenhouse gas emissions increases the associated costs rise; at the design that minimizes emissions, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the micro-grid rises to approximately 7x the current cost of electricity in southern California. Changes in natural gas (NG) prices do not change the micro-grid’s typology, but rather forces a quicker transition to low-carbon typologies. Every micro-grid developed in this chapter contained some amount of dispatchable distributed energy resource (DER), leading to an examination as to why a PV + storage only micro-grid would be unlikely. With the apparent need for micro-grids to contain some amount of distributable generation, a relatively small social cost of carbon of $50 per ton of CO2 ensures that every micro-grid would consist of primarily low-no emission DERs.",5/27/21,5/20/25 15:44,5/20/25 15:44,5/20/25 15:44,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/14666193.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/ULISDZQ5/Rath - 2021 - Future Pathways to U.S. Decarbonization Through Nuclear and Other Energy Systems.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While AM has great potential to address HX manufacturing challenges, it also presents cost and environmental challenges. In Chapter 2, I evaluate laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AM costs for an HX design for concentrating solar power (CSP) with molten salt thermal storage using process-based cost modeling (PBCM). I use this PBCM to identify HX design and LPBF process changes that reduce projected HX cost from $750/kW-th to $220/kW-th. I also identify pathways to further reduce projected cost to $140-160/kW-th by leveraging cutting-edge advances in LPBF technology. In Chapter 3, I extend the PBCM to evaluate alternative CSP HX designs and to enable co-optimization of cost and performance for HX designs for other clean energy applications. In Chapter 4, I characterize the impact of applying productivity improvement strategies for HX on LPBF part cost, speed, and quality via expert elicitation. I find that experts believe that increasing the part footprint is more detrimental to print success than increasing part height. Experts also believe that beam shaping is expected to provide limited print time improvement while improving part quality, whereas going from one to two lasers is expected to provide a moderate print time improvement but degrade part quality. I incorporate expert quantitative insights into the Chapter 2 PBCM and show that the uncertainty in build success rates for large parts dominates expected cost reductions from laser beam shaping or multi laser printing. In Chapter 5, I develop a framework to track metal mass flows through the AM process that comprehensively accounts for sources of uncertainty to enable comparison of various powder production processes. Through a case study of SS316 gas atomization and LPBF, I find that higher AM quality powder yields significantly reduced AM cumulative energy demand (CED), even within the range typical for gas atomization. I also find that for CED of a printed part, AM powder CED impacts part CED less than LPBF part acceptance rate.",2023,5/20/25 15:49,5/20/25 15:49,5/20/25 15:49,14971051 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 14971051 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified; /new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation examines how DER benefit different stakeholders in the electric power sector: DER owners, ratepayers, utilities, and society. In Chapter 2, we investigate how increasing commercial CHP system peak penetrations may affect net emissions, the distribution network, and total system energy costs. We find that small commercial CHP, due to low and inconsistent heat loads, can increase emissions relative to the bulk grid. We suggest policy options to encourage CHP operation during times of high heat loads. In Chapter 3, we develop metrics based on existing best utility practices that characterize how much solar can reduce peak demand on distribution network feeders. We conclude that solar can act as a capacity resource, but the size of the resource depends on the geographic region. Energy storage or an allowance for occasional overloading within a transformer’s tolerance can increase the capacity resource of solar. Chapter 4 is a value of solar and rate impact study for the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC). The Pennsylvania PUC can use it to decide whether the environmental benefits of solar are worth the relatively small rate impact caused by rooftop solar. In Chapter 5, we assess the ability of rooftop solar and storage to reduce peak loads and defer distribution capacity projects in the PECO service territory. We find that targeted placement of solar can increase the total deferral value up to fourfold, but capacity deferral opportunities are rare and large administrative efforts to manage deferral projects, such as markets, are probably not warranted.",3/6/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7808372.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/86ARTD5U/Keen - 2019 - Stakeholder Costs and Benefits of Distributed Energy Resources on Distribution Networks.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Chapter 2 I analyze four years of data (2012-2015) from the Generating Availability Data System (GADS) database maintained by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation(NERC) to evaluate key assumptions made by power system planners when determining capacity requirements. Using block subsampling and binomial modeling, I demonstrate that large unavailable capacity events have occurred with much greater frequency than should be expected if current-practice assumptions hold.In Chapter 3 I propose a nonhomogeneous Markov model to explain the observed correlated failures. I use logistic regression to fit a simple model specification that allows generator transition probabilities to depend on ambient temperatures and system load. I fit the model using 23 years of GADS data for the PJM Interconnection (PJM), the largest system operator by generation capacity in North America. Temperature and load are each statistically significant for two-thirds of generators. Temperature dependencies are observed in all generator types, but are most pronounced for diesel and natural gas generators at low temperatures and nuclear generators at high temperatures. The nonhomogeneous Markov model predicts system-level unavailable capacity substantially better thanthe homogeneous Markov model used currently by industry.In Chapter 4, joint work with Luke Lavin, I quantify the reliability risks implied by temperature dependence in PJM’s generator fleet. We modify an open-source resource adequacy modeling tool to allow generator availability to depend on temperature. We then parameterize the tool for PJM’s system using temperature-dependent forced outage rates developed in Chapter 3. We find that temperature dependence substantially increases capacity requirements to achieve the target level of reliability, though PJM procures still more than our model finds is required. Given the seasonality in temperatures and loads, we also demonstrate that average annual capacity requirements could be significantly reduced were PJM to set separate monthly targets, rather than a single annual target. Finally, we explore the resource adequacy implications of various future generator resource and climate change scenarios for PJM.",5/31/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/8204510.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/8T8N6DH8/Murphy - 2019 - Correlated Generator Failures and Power System Reliability.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies conducted since the early 1990s have observed several changes in public understanding of the causes and consequences of climate change. The aim of this thesis is to explore public understanding and perceptions of various aspects of climate science, climate change, and its impacts. This work provides an update on the climate change perceptions literature, identifying new and persistent knowledge gaps, as well as characterizing the belief-driven undercurrent that consistently predicts support for immediate climate action across my studies.In Chapter 2, I employ a local mail-out survey and a national online survey to explore the extent to which people understand the important differences between common air pollution and carbon dioxide (CO2). This work focuses especially on the very different atmospheric residence times of both—and what drives public support to abate climate change now. I find that people do not understand this fundamental difference, dramatically underestimate how long CO2 remains in the atmosphere and continues to change the climate, and the policy implications of long-lived CO2 in the atmosphere. However, this misunderstanding does not deter respondents from showing strong support for immediate climate action.While Chapter 2 focuses on drivers of climate change, in Chapter 3, I evaluate public perceptions of one of the most salient impacts of climate change: an increase in the frequency of extreme weather. In a two-part study comprised of a convenience sample of face-to-face interviews followed by a national study, I assess when, and to what extent, laypeople attribute extreme events to climate change and whether and how their beliefs are predictive of their decision thresholds, sensitivities, and support for immediate climate action using signal detection theory. I find that prior climate change beliefs are significant drivers that influence how people make decisions in attributing extreme events to climate change and in their self-reported support for immediate action in response to climate risks. I also find that simple spinner boards are effective tools in communicating non-stationary processes, such as attribution, to laypeople.In Chapter 4, I focus on public perceptions of what can be done on the part of individuals to reduce CO2 emissions and how laypeople view the efficacy of individual versus collective actions in a two-part study, starting with a convenience sample of face-to-face interviews and followed by a national study. I find that respondents believe that individuals have higher response-efficacy than what is likely to be attainable from individual actions alone, i.e. apart from any broader societal or governmental action. However, respondents view individual and governmental actions as having the same response-efficacy.Finally, Chapter 5 discusses this work’s contribution to the literature and the implications for the development of risk communications revealed in Chapters 2 through 4. Findings in all chapters show strong support for immediate action against climate risks. Climate change beliefs are significant predictors for decision thresholds and sensitivities in identifying hurricane frequencies as evidence of climate change (Chapter 2) and for support for immediate climate action across my studies (Chapters 2 and 3). These, and other findings reported in the thesis, can inform—and offer opportunities for—the development of improved risk communications, as well as alternative decision-making strategies when it comes to long-term risks and educational interventions.",6/5/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:32,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/8218931.v1,,"/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/WBEDB7KX/Dryden - 2019 - Public Understanding of Climate Science, Extreme Weather and Climate Attribution.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With declining growth rate projections and access to electricity services all near or at 100%, developed countries have increased their share of sustainable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Unlike the most developed nations, populations are expected to increase drastically throughout the developing world in the 21st century. Recent estimates indicate 97% of the world’s population growth through 2030 (1.3 billion more people) will occur in the developing world. The countries of sub-Saharan Africa alone are projected to add over a billion people through 2050. Such population growth in developing countries will result in growing energy demand and thus growing emissions. The United Nations has underscored the importance of ushering in responsible and equitable energy pathways through their Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With a set of goals emphasizing access to affordable and reliable power, access to modern energy services, and reducing poor air quality and GHG emissions, the SDGs aim to improve quality of life across key areas of concern. The aim of this dissertation is to identify and evaluate opportunities for avoiding continued increases in fossil fuel use in sub-Saharan Africa, which would in turn reduce and avoid emissions of greenhouse gases and criteria air pollution and reduce some associated costs.In Chapter 2 we analyze the energy, emissions, and consumer costs of power outages in sub-Saharan African countries. By modeling the fuel mix for the central electricity grid in each country and the diesel fuel needed to produce backup electricity during outages, we estimate the magnitude of these impacts in the region. We show that use of backup generators leads to higher fossil energy consumption (compared to the central grid) in all countries, even countries that already rely on fossil fuels for power generation at centralized plants. Furthermore, for all countries in the analysis, backup diesel generators result in increased mean emissions of at least three of the five pollutants analyzed, compared to the grid. Our analysis highlights the magnitude of potential avoided emissions and economic savings from increased grid reliability, and has implications for achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Increased reliability may not lead to decreases in generator ownership, but it is likely to lead to decreases in generator use, thus avoiding additional emissions and reducing costs for consumers.In Chapter 3 we assess the emissions, health, and economic outcomes of electrifying motorcycle taxis in Kigali, Rwanda. By modeling fleet demand using observed driving distributions, we are able to estimate travel of this unique subset of all motorcycles which form the basis for all estimates. Our analysis reveals that emissions of key pollutants already identified by government officials (NOx, CO, HCs) as well as the greenhouse gas CO2 and health risks from PM2.5 can be drastically reduced via motorcycle fleet electrification. While a reduction of primary and secondary PM2.5 exposure and thus deaths can be achieved with the electrification of motorcycles, such benefits are dependent on the marginal generating unit. Finally, the Levelized Costs of Driving analysis reveals that at least one of the electric motorcycle alternatives presented in this work is cost competitive over a five-year period, and cost competitiveness improves as vehicle life is extended.In Chapter 4 we extend the vehicle electrification analysis to assess the benefits and costs of bus electrification in Rwanda. We employ a Monte Carlo Analysis to assess how the emissions, health impacts, and non-infrastructure costs associated with diesel powered buses compare to those associated with their electric counterparts. We find that mean emissions of CO2, PM2.5, NOx, CO, and HC all decline significantly when travel provided by diesel buses is replaced with electric buses. However, we also observe increased emissions of SO2 with bus electrification due in part to the prevalence of heavy fuel oil and peat electricity generation. Despite this increased SO2, the health analysis reveals that electrification can result in less annual deaths from primary and secondary PM2.5 but not if peat is the marginal electricity generating unit. Our economic analysis shows that electric buses have greater present levelized costs but given a decrease in capital cost and longer lifetime, electric buses can reach parity with the diesel buses. The final analysis in this chapter compares the normalized emissions and costs of conventional motorcycles, electric motorcycles, conventional buses, and electric buses. We find that the electric buses offer the greatest emission reductions (per passenger-kilometer) while the diesel buses offer the cheapest levelized costs. This research highlights the important role public transit electrification could play in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals as countries commit to lower greenhouse gas and harmful air pollutant emissionsFinally, in Chapter 5 we discuss the important role developing countries will play in achieving global sustainability as their population, mobility, and electricity usage rise over the coming decades. We discuss the implications that reliable power and electrification efforts could have for the Sustainable Development Goals and urge developed nations to assist developing countries in implementing some of the technologies necessary for their completion.

Energy efficiency has been identified as a low-cost resource of reducing energy use and hence the carbon footprint in the buildings sector. As a result, a myriad of policy actions has been put in place to ensure that energy reduction goals can be achieved through energy efficiency. This dissertation performs a critical examination of some of these programs and policies that have been put in place with the aim ofensuring that their intended efforts are indeed achieved. This work also provides a prospective look into other considerations e.g. the inclusion of broader health and environmental benefits needed to be made when making the decision about building energy efficiency. In Chapter 2, I use a panel data approach to measure the association of policy implementation at different levels of the government with increases in green building adoption. I find that the effectiveness of green building policies is dependent on both the nature of the policy as well as the background federal policy context. I corroborate existing research by finding that local policies especially requirement and densitybonuses are essential in driving green building certification. I also highlight the importance of federal policies (e.g. federal funding like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act – ARRA) and private actions (e.g. through improvements to the building rating system process) in driving green buildingadoption. These findings highlight that local policy, federal policy, and private actions need to work in tandem to drive green building growth. In Chapter 3, I explore a similar line of questioning, however, focusing on the associations of different energy efficiency programs with reductions in electricity and gas usage. Using the difference-indifferenceand event history modeling approaches, I find that behavioral programs are associated with the largest increases in energy reductions even when compared to financial incentive programs. I also provide a means of detecting unexpected program impacts (i.e. changes that occur at the same time as the introduction of a new technology leading to biased estimates of program impacts) using electricity andgas usage data. I find gas reductions for some electricity-only programs thereby indicating that energyreductions may have occurred in the absence of the program. I highlight here that energy efficiencyprograms have the potential to significantly reduce electricity and gas use in buildings. However, the expost evaluation of these programs need to be appropriately measured to ensure that these reductions are indeed associated with policy implementation as significant amounts of money and time is invested in program implementation. While Chapters 2 and 3 focus on the evaluation of past energy efficiency programs and policies, in Chapter 4, I focus on other considerations that need to be made when making the decision about building energy efficiency. Specifically, I focus on the incorporation of other health and climate impacts when addressing the issue of climate change in the building sector. I investigate the energy reductions,greenhouse gas and other air emission reductions, as well as the private net costs and benefits of implementing a myriad of energy efficiency measures using the case study of the state of Pennsylvania. I find significant energy reductions compared to 2017 baseline levels - 36%, 44%, 19%, and 43% reductions of electricity, gas, propane, and fuel oil. More importantly, I estimate significant social benefits of $2.4billion per year and highlight the energy efficiency measures which maximize both theprivate and social benefits for the state. In Chapter 5, I discuss overarching conclusions and some considerations for policy revealed in Chapters 2 to 4. Findings in Chapters 2 and 3, for example, show the benefits of non-economic programs and incentives in driving building energy efficiency. I corroborate the nascent research on behavioralprograms on energy reductions and recommend that utility evaluators examine non-financial program and policy approaches to reducing energy use as it also offers a low-cost alternative to promoting energy use reductions. More specifically, In Chapter 2, I learn that policy actors i.e. local and federal policy makers, as well as private bodies, need to work together in driving green building adoption. However, highlighted is the need for more transparency in ensuring that green building certifications are indeed translating toenergy reductions. In Chapter 3, I learn the importance of more robust analyses when using data-driven approaches in the energy measurement and verification process of energy efficiency programs. In Chapter 4, I find that energy efficiency measures which yield the highest private benefits may not necessarily yield the highest social benefits therefore highlighting the need for a more holistic look when making the decision between competing energy efficiency measures.",10/11/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:34,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/9792074.v1,,"/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/XS3S24P5/Adekanye - 2019 - Evaluation of Building Policies, Programs, and Potential for Energy Efficiency in the United States.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the security techniques that are well-suited to the traditional cloud computing model do not adequately protect against the increased cyber-physical and privacy risk element of the Internet of Things (IoT). Off-premise code execution in the hybrid cloud computingmodel must be resilient against both malicious software and an adversary with physical access. Moreover, in the absence of user-controlled and remotely verifiable data protectionmechanisms, individuals must implicitly rely upon application service providers — including the full software stack responsible for the deployment, management, and monitoring of cloud workloads — for the handling of personal data. This work develops the concept of fog mediation — a fog computing systems design pattern, derived exclusively from the physical microstructure of commodity CPUs, for generating user-controlled cryptographic key material and, thereupon, mediating the usability, security, and privacy requirements of security-sensitive Internet of Things applications.The tamper-evident key generation properties of an isolated execution environment enable security-sensitive application logic and data to move freely between on-premise and offpremise computing resources. Fog mediation maps the variegated device capabilities of the IoT to a manageable set of mandatory protections and discretionary controls that accord with the application requirements and the data handling preferences of individuals. How we regulate the use of data in the context of IoT has significant implications forindividual rights with regards to personal data and notions of privacy and cybersecurity in an increasingly connected society. The policy analysis focuses on laws, standards, and regulations relevant to the use of IoT in the United States.

They report not receiving information about doulas from their health care providers, which contributes to this gap in knowledge and is interpreted as a signal that the provider does not support the choice to use a doula. Lastly, pregnant women anticipate potentially negative relationship consequences when they imagine using a doula—both with their health care provider as well as with their partner. Conclusions/Implications: Health care providers can provide preliminary information about doulas to their patients via methods such as a poster or pamphlet. This would not only give pregnant women basic information on the benefits of doulas but also signal that they support the decision. Doula communications can better address women’s knowledge needs and relationship fears by including information about their role in supporting both women and partners in the child birth experience.",2/28/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:26,,,,,,,Doula Decisions,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7786595.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/8FAAZM2P/McDonald - 2019 - Doula Decisions A Mental Models Approach to UnderstandingLack of Doula Use Despite the Benefits.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this dissertation, I provide three examples that illustrate how uncertainty is often not adequately characterized, how missing data can pose a barrier to climate-relevant policy making, and how big data and machine learning could be used to obtain important information. I conclude with a survey and a discussion of how artificial intelligence can be applied to climate change mitigation. In the first chapter, I show how to construct an empirical estimate of the uncertainty of long-termenergy forecasts based on past forecast errors, using projections made by the U.S. Energy InformationAgency (EIA). This method gives analysts and decision-makers a means to estimate the uncertaintyof those forecasts quantitatively. Energy forecasts provide the basis for financial evaluation of energyinvestments as well as for energy system models. I lay the groundwork for evaluating the performance of these methods in the data-scarce setting of long-term forecasts. The EIA has used my results in their most recent retrospective review. The second chapter is based on a topical review of policies to decarbonize heavy freight transportationby shifting freight from road to rail and water. I find that while the freight sector is responsible for a large share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a systematic analysis of the potential to decarbonize with modal shift is still missing from the literature. This is partly due to a lack ofpublicly available, standardized, and updated data. For a global comparison of modal split and trends, I expanded existing databases with national freight activity from 2000-2017. I find that only less than half of the countries in the world provide such information on road freight activity. The third chapter provides an example of how big data and machine learning (ML) could be used to fill in information gaps that inhibit climate policy analysis. I use satellite imagery for truck traffic monitoring in areas where this information is otherwise difficult to obtain. I count the number of freight vehicles visible in the images with deep convolutional neural networks, and estimate theaverage annual truck traffic on roads from those counts by modeling traffic variation patterns. In a final chapter, I discuss how methods from artificial intelligence can be used to improve socioeconomic, policy, and engineering research for climate change mitigation. I provide a survey ofthe literature and identify the main barriers and challenges that arise at the intersection of those disciplines. Research in this area demands both careful design of ML algorithms and consideration of domain knowledge.

RA525W2C,thesis,2019,"Mayfield, Erin",Cumulative Impact and Equity Objectives in Energy Systems Modeling and Policy,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Cumulative_Impact_and_Equity_Objectives_in_Energy_Systems_Modeling_and_Policy/7808555/1,"Energy system development is driven by the complexity inherent in physical systems and the influence of a myriad of diverse, interacting stakeholders with heterogeneous preferences. Transforming energy systems entails balancing multiple and often conflicting societal objectives. This thesis presents new modeling approaches for energy systems planning and policy evaluation, with an emphasis on cumulative impacts, equity, and system heterogeneity. The application domain of this thesis is the U.S. natural gas system, although the analytical approaches and insight of this research are intended to extend to the broader domestic and global energy system.Chapter 2 adopts a traditional economic efficiency optimization approach, coupled with methane emissions and abatement cost simulations reflecting system heterogeneity, to evaluate and design system-wide and super emitter policies related to methane abatement in the U.S. transmission and storage system. We find that most emissions, given the existing suite of technologies, have the potential to be abated. We also demonstrate that there are high societal benefits from abatement policies, and minimal (if any) private costs under standard and tax instruments. Superemitter policies, which target the highest emitting facilities, may reduce the private cost burden and achieve high emission reductions, especially if emissions across facilities are highly skewed. However, detection across all facilities is necessary regardless of the policy option, and there are nontrivial societal benefits resulting from abatement of relatively low-emitting sources. Chapters 3 aims to develop and demonstrate a data-driven approach for characterizing systems-level cumulative impacts of current energy systems. Specifically, we comprehensively assess the spatially-and temporally-resolved air, climate, and employment impacts from extraction to end use and over the life of natural gas plays in the Appalachian basin from 2004 to 2016. Our approach highlights the attribution of impacts across the supply chain, the tradeoffs between near- and long-term impacts, and the evolution and accumulation of impacts over time with changing regulation, natural gas activity, and technological and operational efficiencies and practices. We show that short-lived air quality and employment impacts track with the boom-and-bust cycle, while climate impacts persist for generations well beyond the period of natural gas activity. We also find that employment effects are spatially concentrated in rural areas with thin labor markets where development is occurring, and more than half of cumulative premature mortality is within source emissions states. We show that most premature mortality is associated with end uses, while upstream and midstream segments also account for a substantial portion of impacts. With respect to climatechange impacts, the magnitude of methane emissions across the supply chain produces temperature impacts nearly equivalent to that of carbon dioxide over a 30-year time horizon, but over longer integration periods, the warming impact from carbon dioxide dominates. We estimate a tax on production of $2 per thousand cubic foot (+172%/-76%) would compensate for cumulative climate and air quality externalities across the supply chain.In Chapter 4, we develop a multiobjective optimization model incorporating cumulative impact objectives to facilitate future energy system planning. We develop natural gas system pathways by optimizing impacts with respect to sequential natural gas decisions regarding the timing and location of infrastructure and activity from extraction to end use. Environmental and employment objectives are conflicting if we follow a natural gas pathway consistent with the status quo; however, a collection siting, emissions abatement, and renewable integration policies may collectively resolve and reverse these conflicts.In Chapter 5, we develop and demonstrate an approach for evaluating the equity state of an energy system. We apply variants of standard methods and present new methods and metrics to quantify spatial, temporal, and distributional equity, leveraging impact estimates of the shale gas boom in the Appalachian basin from Chapter 3. We find that there are high temporal and spatial inequities with respect to cumulative air and employment impacts, and that spatial inequities are constant over time reflecting largely fixed infrastructure and consumption patterns. We also present indicators of temporal climate inequities, estimating that long-term global temperature impacts are 100 times that of near-term impacts. With respect to distributional equity of air quality impacts, we do not observe a disparity in mortality rates across sub-populations on the basis of income and poverty; however, there is a trend of increasing income corresponding to decreasing damages, which demonstrates the higher health burden of lower income communities. With respect to distributional equity of labor markets, we find statistically significant declines in the income disparity and poverty rates in producing counties. Pairwise comparisons of impacts reveal that changes in air and climate impacts are sensitive to changes in employment impacts.In Chapter 6, we develop future natural gas system pathways that optimize for the multiple dimensions of equity. We expand upon the multiobjective optimization model developed in Chapter 4, deriving objectives that instill different normative concepts of spatial, temporal, and distributional equity that apply to air, climate, and employment impacts. We find that there are inherent conflicts between different equity dimensions, as well as, between equity and cumulative impact objectives in a fossil-fuel dominated energy system. However, low-carbon technologies have the potential to reduce inequities.",3/6/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7808555.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TEFKZGCG,thesis,2019,"Sergi, Brian",Integrating Climate and Health Damages in Decision-Making for the Electric Power Sector,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Integrating_Climate_and_Health_Damages_in_Decision-Making_for_the_Electric_Power_Sector/8204723/1,"This dissertation explores the connection between the climate and health impacts of emissions, focusing primarily on the electric power sector. The combustion of fossil fuels is a critical source of carbon dioxide— the principal greenhouse gas driving climate change—and of conventional air pollutants that are detrimental to human health. In this work, we explore the connection between these impacts by examining their role in shaping public support for emissions reductions, by advancing methods for quantifying the health impacts of emissions, and by investigating the benefits of directly linking and co-optimizing for benefits related to these two impacts during the design of policies for emissions reductions. In Chapter 2, we conduct a U.S.-based discrete choice survey to explore the influence of climate and health information on respondents’ support for reducing emissions. We find that, on average, respondents value information on the climate and health impacts of emissions, and are willing to pay more for emissions reductions that target both health and climate benefits simultaneously than they are for scenarios that address only climate or health alone. Respondents also demonstrate that their support for renewable energy sources is largely driven by the perceived health and climate benefits those sources would provide. These findings highlight the importance of communicating these types of benefits when advancing emissions reductions or policies intended to further clean energy. We extend this line of questioning in Chapter 3, in which we conduct a similar survey among residents of ten Chinese cities. In addition to the survey structure from Chapter 2, we use observed air quality data from the locations of the respondents to explore whether air pollution at different time-scales (e.g. hourly, daily, or annual averages) shows any relationship with preferences for emissions reductions. As with the U.S.-based survey, the average respondent demonstrates a willingness to pay more in electricity bills for cleaner energy sources, and in particular sources that are expected to address both health and climate issues. While short-term air quality levels show no relationship with respondents’ support for emissions cuts, respondents in areas of historically worse air quality demonstrate substantially higher willingness to pay for reducing emissions to improve human health, suggesting the importance of awareness of long-term pollution trends to building support for emissions reductions. Having explored how the public interacts with information on the climate and health impacts of emissions, Chapter 4 sets out to evaluate the health effects of air pollution in the U.S. We use an integrated assessment model with reduced complexity air quality modeling and emissions data from 2008, 2011, and 2014 to estimate county-level ambient particulate matter concentrations, population exposure, and finally health consequences, with a focus on how the location of those consequences relate to the origin of emissions. We estimate that total health damages in the U.S. declined from 2008 to 2014, driven largely by the closure of point sources like coal power plants. Despite this, some counties incur increasing per capita health damages over that time period. Though decreasing slightly over time, a large share of health damages continues to be attributable to pollution originating in a different location from where the damages are incurred, implying a sustained need for integrated and transboundary approaches to managing air pollution. Finally, Chapter 5 builds on the previous work by examining how estimates of the health impacts of emissions might be incorporated into the design of policies intended to address climate change for the electric power sector. Using data on the existing fossil fuel fleet and information on the marginal damage of pollution from the analysis in Chapter 4, we investigate how changing the location of power plant retirements and emissions reductions might achieve the same climate goals while maximizing health benefits. We find that using health to inform which plants retire and are replaced by natural gas can increase health benefits by close to one-third while incurring relatively incremental mitigation costs. These gains are in addition to the substantial health benefits achieved by a climate-only approach and are fairly robust to uncertainty and subjective parameter decisions. Policy makers might incorporate these findings by more directly considering the health implications of different pathways for achieving climate targets.",5/31/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/8204723.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/GHRIS5N7/Sergi - 2019 - Integrating Climate and Health Damages in Decision-Making for the Electric Power Sector.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis focuses on three problems related to health, environmental and/or climate change externalities associated with the operation of the power sector. In Chapter 1, I estimate the trace elements mass flow rates from U.S. coal-fired power plants, a negative externality that is not well monitored at the plant level, except for gas phase emissions of Hg. I create a generalizable model for stochastically estimating trace element mass flow rates, specifically Hg, Se, As, and Cl, to solid, liquid, and gas phase waste streams of coal-fired power plants and evaluate the accuracy against available data. When compared with measured and reported data on trace element mass flow rates, I find that my model generally overestimates trace element concentrations in coal, leading to overestimation of trace element mass flow rates to the waste streams. The partitioning estimates are consistent for Se, As, and Cl removal from flue gas, but tend to underestimate Hg removal. Model performance would improve with access to more recent measurements of trace element concentrations in the coal blend, where data quality is the weakest. In Chapter 2, I focus on the issue of understanding the emissions of SO2, NOx and CO2 that would result from policies that would lead to an increased usage of coal. I also study the emissions consequences of turning off some of the currently installed air pollution technologies at U.S. coal power plants. While a coal resurgence is unlikely due to other market forces, an increase in coal electricity will cause increases in SO2, NOx and CO2, which have significant human health, environment, and climate consequences. I explore the potential consequences of an increase in coal generation under two bounding scenarios: 1) I assume that environmental regulations are weakened so that coal plants turn off their wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction devices and 2) I assume coal electricity becomes cheaper to operate than natural gas and displaces natural gas electricity. Turning off wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reactor devices leads to SO2 and NOx that would be twice to three times the emissions observed in 2017. These emissions levels were last observed about 7-10 years ago. A resurgence of coal that would displace natural gas would increase SO2, NOx, and CO2 emissions by 41%, 45%, and 21% compared to 2017 levels. In Chapter 3, I study the potential of deep decarbonization of the Pennsylvania electricity sector, which is an energy policy goal which would push coal out of the fuel mix. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Pennsylvania to 20% of 2005 levels by 2050. While deep decarbonization is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change, the infrastructure required to implement deep decarbonization can create significant land and forest impacts that may negatively impact ecology. I model pathways to deep decarbonize Pennsylvania’s electricity sector, quantify the land and forest land use from these pathways, and estimate potential ecological impacts using fragmentation indices. Even if all the coal plants retire, the emissions from current natural gas plants exceed the carbonization goals, suggesting that natural gas cannot be a bridge fuel. If only wind is built, the total land use is 13,300 km2 (Pennsylvania is 119,000 km2), with direct land use and forest land use impacts of 520 km2 and 370 km2, respectively. Solar farms are constructed across Pennsylvania, as there is insufficient land in the southeast where resources are highest, impacting 2400 km2 of forested land. As such, solar contributes to a greater loss of landscape than wind, but wind requires significantly more land allocated to deep decarbonize the Pennsylvania electricity sector. Through these three chapters, I find that energy policy needs to be assessed on a holistic basis by considering all possible cost and benefits of a potential policy. While policy goals, such as decarbonization of the electricity grid, will create obvious net benefits, energy interventions still need to be carefully planned out by decision makers to avoid and minimize other downstream problems. Other policy interventions, such as promoting more coal for the sake of grid reliability, may introduce such significant costs that they should be scrapped entirely.",6/5/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:34,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/8223944.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/3BWXJM23/Sun - 2019 - Pollution Externalities and Emissions’ Consequences of the U.S. Electricity Sector.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Systems are comprised of two parts: treatment and distribution. Water quality is excellent immediately after treatment; however, it changes with time in the distribution network. Post-treatment residual contaminants interact chemically and biologically within the distribution network causing consumed drinking water quality to vary spatially and temporally across the network. As a result, maintaining post-treatment water quality throughout the extensive piped distribution network in the face of many complex chemical and biological relationships is a challenge for water utilities. Drinking water treatment and distribution system challenges are exacerbated by changes in water demands, associated with changes in population and industry, and the age and long-term deferred maintenance of distribution systems.Regulatory and public health requirements for water systems change, and as a result these systems have to be modified, upgraded or expanded over time. Meeting the existing and future challenges of drinking water needs requires a significant amount of resources and may require utilities to consider a broader set of engineering alternatives. The requirement for significant financial investment and the need to meet multiple objectives (e.g., cost, water quality) creates complex decision problems that benefits from a systems-based approach.Effective analysis of system conditions and challenges requires models. The model selected needs to be “fit-for-purpose” and tailored specifically to the system, decision context, and decision-maker to be considered useful in the decision-making context. This work applies models to two different stages of decision-making: problem framing and planning. A framing model provides an initial analysis of the system or topic area (e.g., prevalence of lead in drinking water), this type of model assesses available datasets to identify relevant ones, and aids decision-makers in identifying the target engineering question to investigate in subsequent analyses. A planning model is designed to address a specific set of engineering questions (e.g., where to place treatment in an existing system) and evaluates a wide range of alternatives to identify a set of promising options to be considered further by decision-makers. In this work, first, an integrated simulation and optimization planning model is used to identify the location and capacity of treatment plants within an existing distribution network. Second, a statistical framing model is applied to evaluate the prevalence of lead release within drinking water systems.The research objectives of this work are as follows:1. Develop a new approach to integrate optimization and physicochemical simulation models to improve selection or prioritization of engineering infrastructure design options in drinking water systems;2. Develop a multi-objective framework to evaluate the role of regulatory limits and the tradeoffs between cost and public health in locating and sizing drinking water treatment infrastructure;3. Evaluate the spatial distribution and relationship among water-lead and non-water lead hazards and density of sensitive populations to identify regions most likely exposed to elevated lead levels; and4. Define the extents of the uncertainty associated with the Lead and Copper Rule compliance evaluation to inform lead in drinking water decision-making beyond regulatory assessment.",10/11/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:34,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/9735977.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This makes it difficult to disentanglemobile services and Internet services in studies on the digital divide. As countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which have the lowest adoption rates globally, look to leverage digital technologies as a tool to drive economic and social development, there is a need for continued and novel approaches to understanding the digital divide. This thesis proposes a new approach to conceptualizing the digital divide and characterizes the three levels of the digital divide:inequalities in access, use, and benefits from use in SSA, using Nigeria as a case study. This work also critically examines the effect of recent pricing policies in Nigeria on the digital divide, as well as the effect of other sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors at the individual level. In Chapter 2, I run a choice-based conjoint experiment to understand the impact of access toover-the-top (OTT) services on individual preferences for different mobile services – cellular calls, text, or the different services on the Internet – or not using any mobile service (the first level digital divide). I find that when OTTs are introduced into the market, mobile users are lesslikely to go without mobile services or to use a traditional service. I also find that this effect is significant in a market with a pay-as-you-go business model. The results also reveal that mobile users are price sensitive, therefore pricing policies may aid in bridging the first and second levelsof the digital divide. The findings indicate that customers’ preferences in the mobile market are changing and OTT access could be a tool in closing the first-level digital divide. Therefore, I recommend that policies to drive Internet access, especially OTT, should be explored. In Chapter 3, I use a panel data approach to estimate the effect of reduction in the prices of mobile Internet plans on the volume of use of the Internet, cellular calls, and text messaging services (the second-level digital divide). I find that the reduction in the prices is associated with an increase in the volume of data used and a decrease in the volume of texts sent by an individual. However, reducing the prices of mobile Internet plans does not “close” the second level digital divide across socioeconomic groups. I did not see a convergence in the volume of use of any of the mobile services across any demographic subgroups. These findings suggest that more robust policies that are targeted at specific subgroups are needed to reduce the existingsecond-level mobile technology digital divide that exists in developing countries. In Chapter 4, I draw on the Uses and Gratifications Theory, the Unified Theory of Acceptanceand Use of Technology, and factor analysis to examine the differences in the frequency and type of Internet use (second-level digital divide) and the differences in outcomes from Internet use (third-level digital divide). I find that females, the older population, and individuals with a lowerlevel of education are the digitally disadvantaged subset of the population. I also find that high technical skills are associated with high frequency of use of the Internet for personal development, social, and business activities. I also find that encouragement from family and friends as well as intention to increase Internet use in the future are associated with increased frequency of use of the Internet for consuming news content and social interaction respectively. This supports arguments in an earlier work that improving access to over-the-top applications such as WhatsApp could increase Internet use. In examining the determinants of the third-level digital divide, I find that using the Internet for social activities such as using social networks and communicating with family and friends have the greatest impact on offline outcomes. I also findthat individuals with a high level of education are more likely to get positive health outcomes and less likely to get personal development outcomes, such as getting a job or completing an online training, from the Internet.In Chapter 5, I discuss this work’s contribution to the literature and some of the policy implications of the findings in Chapters 2 through 4. Findings in Chapters 2 through 4 suggest that supporting the use of OTT and social networks in developing countries would have benefits. These Internet activities, although they may not directly contribute to personal development or economic gains, typically require little technical skills. Therefore, by engaging with theseInternet activities, the digitally disadvantaged subset of the population would be able to develop the required skills to achieve benefits from Internet use. In Chapter 3, I learn that addressing the affordability barrier in a developing country is not enough to bridge the second-level digital divide. More robust policies are needed to bridge the second-level digital divide in developing countries. In Chapter 4, I learn that the digital disadvantage may simply be a reflection ofsocietal inequalities in the online space. Therefore, in order to bridge the digital divide, target policies that address these preexisting inequalities are recommended.",10/18/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:35,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/9964220.v1,,"/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/NCWTZ7W2/Ogbo - 2019 - Impact of Over-the-top Services, Pricing, and Equity on the Digital Divides in Sub-Saharan Africa.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response, these households rely on fossil fuel-based technologies to meet their household needs. Families without grid access rely on kerosene lamps predominantlyto meet lighting needs, while grid-connected homes use fossil fuel backup generators. Studies of fossil fuel solutions like kerosene lamps and backup generators show that these technologies impose negative socio-economic impacts on both households and society. As a result, researchers and policymakers have been motivated to explore cleaner and more sustainable technologies like residential solar electric with battery storage systems. This thesis through aquantitative investigation of residential solar systems to analyzes the technical, economic, and environmental merits of residential solar systems in their applicability to address key electricity challenges facing sub-Saharan households.For households in rural areas without access in Kenya, solar home systems provide a cost effective alternative to kerosene lamps as a better lighting alternative, and even better for household economics when the additional services are considered like phone charging. I found was price elasticity of demand to be the key determinant of economic attractiveness for lighting services, which attempts to quantify the value households place on improved lightingservice. For grid connected households, findings suggest that residential solar with battery storage electric systems can provide improved household electricity reliability while reducing reliance on backup generators. However, these systems increase grid demand. The main driver of theeconomic attractiveness of these systems are the household’s reliability needs which is reflectedin how many hours the household’s backup generators is available for dispatch in the event of a grid outage as well as discount rate. The study finds that grid availability is also a key determinant of the economic attractiveness of these residential systems, because the quality of grid service in terms of how many hours the grid provides power to the household determines the overall level of backup generator reliance.",10/18/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:35,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/9964253.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/NQWTPWM4/Udeani - 2019 - Improving Electricity Access and Reliability using Residential Solar Systems with Battery Storage Sy.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Informed by a quantitative comparison of the numerical thresholds of reporting for gas grid and power generator failure events, I recommend a new reporting requirement for the gas grid that will bring it into line with the requirements for gas-fired power plant operators.In chapter 3, I examine why gas-fired power plants in the United States have failed because of fuel shortages. I analyze six years of data from a database of power plant failures called the Generating Availability Data System (GADS). Using pipeline scheduling data, I identify areas of the natural gas grid where enough pipeline space may be available so that increased priority fuel contacts could help mitigate fuel shortages at gas-fired power generators.Chapter 4 examines the economics of distributed fuel storage as a mitigation option for gas shortages at power plants in areas of the U.S. where pipeline space was not historically available. I estimate the additional costs required for New England gas-fired generators to install either distributed compressed natural gas (CNG) storage or oil dual fuel capabilities as fuel security measures at power plant sites.

We manipulated the presence, sequence, skill, and information display of Artificial Intelligence (AI) advice in a strategy game against another AI opponent that sometimes varied its skill to measure their effect on users’ performance. Human agent teams outperformed unaided subjects with those receiving the AI recommendations simultaneously achieving the best results. Although team performance was higher and subjects improved during game play, there was little evidence of learning from their AI advisors. AI reliability proved to be the greatest determiner of team performance with subjects retaining trust in higher skilled advisors even in varied environments. Those with higher numeracy demonstrated the highest ability to make use of AI advice including more detailed output formats including ranking of choices and probabilities. More reliable AI agents correlated to higher AI trust while higher self-confidence correlated to greater rejection of AI advice, greater confidence in success, but slightly lower performance. The value of these human agent teams depended on AI reliability, users’ ability to extract lessons from their advice, and users’ trust in that advice. Organizations implementing human agent teams should conduct testing to know how well users appropriately rely on AI recommendations.",10/1/24,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/26939797.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCIs, positioned at the forefront of technological innovation, hold the potential to revolutionize lives on a scale unprecedented by current technologies. We begin with defining BCIs and assessing their current developmental status, emphasizing those forms most likely to soon enter the market and spotlighting key developers in this field. Chapter 2 navigates the intricate regulatory landscape governed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We analyze FDAs regulatory documents, distilling the most pertinent ones for BCI regulation. Special attention is given to the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) and Pre-Market Approval (PMA) processes, vital for assuring the safety and efficacy of implanted BCIs. The heart of this study addresses the shortcomings in the FDA's standardized benefit risk communication methods. We advocate for the adaptation of the Benefit-Risk Framework (BRF), traditionally employed in drug and biologic assessments, to the medical device domain. This proposed application aims to refine communication among developers, regulators, and end-users, ensuring comprehensive understanding of BCIs benefits and risks. We introduce a hypothetical BCI device, reflective of those in current clinical trials, to craft a BRF through an expert elicitation process. This BRF seamlessly integrates medical insights with user-centric considerations, offering a holistic view of the hypothetical device's impact. Employing a decision science approach, particularly informed choice theories, we analyze user responses to various summaries of the BCI and its BRF. Using order-constrained methods, we examine specific hypotheses. Our findings indicate that while the BRF bolsters knowledge of and positivity toward the BCI, the decision to adopt depends more on personal feelings than information depth or amount of knowledge about it. We conclude by highlighting the scientific contributions and policy implications of our study. This research emphasizes the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach in BCI development, bridging the gap between technical innovation and user-centric understanding.",1/19/24,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,A Benefit-Risk Framework for Brain Computer Interfaces,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/24990672.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bottom-up ESOMs simulate technology-level decisions within an energy system, including interactions across economic sectors. These models include detailed techno-economic technological representation of individual technologies, requiring inputs including capital, fixed, and variable costs, energy consumption, technology lifetime, and emissions factors. The results provide insight into possible future energy systems, including the total system cost, technology capacity, energy use, and emissions, based on current techno-economic data and assumptions. In this thesis, I use the Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa), an open-source bottom-up ESOM, to simulate the US energy system under various decarbonization policies. In Chapter 2, I simulate the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in conjunction with various policy instruments to understand how the US can meet its stated climate goals. Specifically, I compare a carbon tax to a combination of technology and fuel standards, finding that the average GHG abatement cost under the modeled standards is comparable to a carbon tax set at ~$200/ton CO2-eq, and both policies achieve similar emissions reductions. In Chapter 3, I develop an algorithm to translate regional air pollution from the transportation and electric sectors to the county resolution, then link the results to an integrated assessment model. I then quantify air pollution exposure and disparity across racial groups under six different policies, including a 2050 net-zero target. I find that existing disparities persist until at least 2030, particularly for Black non-Hispanic Americans. After 2035, the strictest policies approach racial equity, achieving at least an 80% reduction in disparity and exposure for all racial groups relative to 2020. In Chapter 4, I explore the role of hydrogen in decarbonizing steel production in the US. I find that, despite industry and research attention on hydrogen-based direct reduced iron (H2DRI), this technology is only a cost-effective decarbonization strategy under a very narrow set of conditions. Under current capital and variable cost estimates of US steel decarbonization, we find that carbon capture technologies can achieve comparable emissions reductions relative to H2DRI at a lower price. We find that green hydrogen is deployed preferentially elsewhere in the economy under a net-zero constraint. Additionally, we find that IRA tax credits are insufficient to drive hydrogen use in steelmaking, and for sustained H2DRI use, a tax credit specifically aimed at promoting green steel production would need to be as high as $300 per tonne steel produced.",4/19/24,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:41,,,,,,,An Energy Systems Model Approach to US Decarbonization,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/25452034.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grounding my interdisciplinary approach in infrastructure asset management practice and social justice theory, I develop several analytical methods for conducting quantitative equity screenings, determining the socioeconomic impacts of infrastructure quality, and rectifying inequities through improved project selection. Previous studies of community-level impacts have either focused on individual projects or the distribution of roadway condition across a single city. Thus, the distribution of infrastructure condition, maintenance actions during the operational life of the assets, and the associated impacts on the neighboring communities are under-studied. To complement these important studies and inform the stakeholder engagement processes that emanate from them, I scale quantitative social equity screenings to state and national infrastructure management programs. For nationwide studies of bridge and highway inventories, I find that the risks and burdens associated with roads and bridges in poor condition have asymmetrically been borne by socioeconomically disadvantaged and marginalized communities (Study 1, Chapter 2). Through econometric assessments of the communities near the highway, I find that the burdens from poor condition highways are associated with less employment, lower earnings, and less vehicle commuting (Study 2, Chapter 3). For bridges in the United States, I show that addressing these inequities with socially-aware project selecting criteria is feasible within realistic budgets and does not decrease the overall performance of the inventory (Study 3, Chapter 4). Beyond transportation infrastructure management in the United States, these methods could be adapted to assess equity and prioritize investment plans for a myriad of infrastructure systems and public services that have long life-cycles and entrenched footprints such as dams, tunnels, and other such assets.",5/10/24,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:47,,,,,,,Social Equity in Transportation Infrastructure Management,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/25747095.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore this, I start by assessing the potential of using large-scale infrastructure networks as social sensors to detect aspects of inequity to better inform investment policy. I focus my exploration on broadband infrastructure to begin with, exploring the possibility of using U.S. county-level broadband penetration rates as a social sensor to predict rates of unemployment amidst the COVID-19 pandemic (Chapter 2). This work specifically asks, “How can infrastructure serve as a social sensor that allows for sharper detection of those groups which are most vulnerable to disruption?”. I find that broadband can serve as an effective social sensor which is sharpened when applied to employment contexts relevant to broadband, but, as with any sensor, is prone to error (either false positives or false negatives). I then shift my interest from the macro-system to a more micro-focused approach of how to incorporate preferences from end-users into the investment process. To do this, I develop an innovative approach to incorporating qualitative interview responses into a multi-criteria decision-making process (Chapter 3). I find that hauled system water users in Alaska have a strong preference for the aesthetic properties of their water provision which they balance against the need for reliable water system delivery. I end my investigation by understanding the role that skills play as a sensor for detecting effective and equitable use of infrastructure. To do this, I explore broadband connectivity throughout Rwanda and its impact on a critical aspect of development, public health (Chapter 4). To explore this question, I ask to what degree are wireless biomedical devices (specifically EKGs) available and used in the public hospital system in Rwanda? And what impact does broadband access have on the kinds of services which are offered? I find that the first tier of the digital divide influences the ability of offer telehealth services and propose additional future work on the compounded impacts of this access on both second and their tier access.",5/24/24,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:44,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/25800007.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is  a risk of continuing historical inequities (e.g., air pollution burden disparities) from the current  power system into the future. In this dissertation, I quantify sustainability and equality impacts  from different decarbonization pathways in the U.S. These analyses show how decarbonization  decisions may impact different demographic groups and how different goals of  decarbonization may have trade-offs between sustainability outcomes. In Chapter 2, I quantify  the air pollution disparities across regions and demographic groups across eight  decarbonization scenarios. I tie a capacity expansion model to a reduced complexity air  pollution model to capture community level impacts. I provide policy implications given the  differences in air pollution disparities across demographics and decarbonization scenarios.  This chapter lays a framework for evaluating equality in air pollution impacts given national  level decarbonization decisions. In Chapter 3, I evaluate the trade-offs across sustainability  criteria for 32 decarbonization outcomes in 2050. I look at economic, environmental, and social  sustainability across eleven unique stakeholder preference scenarios. Under social  sustainability, I specifically focus on distributional equality criteria. I also discuss the impacts  of policies on overall sustainability performance in 2050. In Chapter 4, I evaluate how different  spatial resolution and downscaling methodologies, which have been used to estimate air  pollution burden across race/ethnicity groups resulting from national level decarbonization  decisions, impact the estimated magnitude of burden across groups. I look across four different  sensitivities and quantify how the spatial resolution of data will impact outcomes of air  pollution burden.

The electricity grid acts as the essential infrastructure of contemporary society. Decarbonizing it will require a shift to cleaner and low-carbon energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydropower, to meet national decarbonization goals. Public acceptance plays a pivotal role in the success of electricity decarbonization goals. The transition to low-carbon energy sources, such as renewables, hinges on gaining support and understanding from the public. This will require decision-makers and other community leaders to recognize and address public concerns. At the same time, they foster public awareness of the benefits of low-carbon technologies and engage communities in decision-making.  This dissertation delves into public preferences and social approval of low-carbon technologies in the context of US decarbonization. Chapter 2 introduces Grid2050, a dynamic web-based tool developed using R Shiny that supports users in exploring alternative portfolios of present and possible future electricity generation technologies. A version of this tool serves as a framework for Chapter 3, which focuses on a public survey assessing preferences for low-carbon 2035 electricity portfolios. The study reveals diverse technology preferences where portfolios include novel technologies like CCS and offshore wind. Also, preferences are influenced by demographic factors, such as age, income, and attitudes, emphasizing the need for adaptive strategies. Chapter 4 explores the prediction of county-level wind receptivity using a machine-learning model and data from withdrawn wind project submissions. The results highlight regional variations in factors impacting receptivity, offering a model with potential application to assess the viability of various technologies in different areas. In conclusion, the dissertation contributes valuable insights into public preferences, technology acceptance, and regional receptivity, offering a comprehensive approach to advancing the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable, and resilient energy future in the United States.",2024,5/20/25 15:59,5/20/25 15:59,5/20/25 15:59,4754539 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 4754539 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Environmental Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deploying large amounts of renewable energy is a key aspect in transitioning to a low?carbon economy and limiting the negative effects of climate change. However, in addition to  technical and economic challenges, renewable energy deployment must satisfy environmental,  social, and regulatory interests. Given the breadth of disparate interests affecting deployment prospects, I develop models and frameworks that help quantify the costs and benefits of offshore  wind deployment, demonstrate how several interests can be balanced in plant design, and  operationalize qualitative factors to inform decision makers on the tradeoffs of deployment  strategies. The technological scope of these studies is on offshore wind renewable energy which  is a nascent energy source with a large—still untapped—technical potential, and energy  decarbonization potential.   First, I consider a novel way of deploying floating offshore wind turbines that reduces physical  obstructions and allows turbines to be built in less-contentious waters. I quantify one  environmental benefit and the cost of this strategy. I find that the strategy realizes a cost penalty  of at least 30 US dollars/megawatt-hour and eliminates up to 900 kilometers of mooring chains for  a 1-gigawatt array. While this added cost is substantial, there are further opportunities and  scenarios where this strategy can make sense. I then investigate plant technology and site  alternatives using a multi-criteria analysis framework to compare the suitability of alternatives  based on optimizing techno-economics and minimizing impacts. I find that the larger plants the  industry is pushing toward are fragile in terms of suitability of locations, while smaller plants are  more robust with respect to locations. I also find that there are large areas where the two  perspectives align that the industry should pursue. This suggests that an overly narrow view on techno-economics only can lead to uncertain project outcomes. Finally, I propose a way to  operationalize socio-political aspects and regulatory obligations of the adoption environment in  order to compare transmission strategies from offshore wind which may face differential  obligations. I find that shortening the development process by one year is equivalent to an  investment tax credit of 2.6% and may be worth more than 65 million euros for a single project. I  also find that there are very few scenarios where a novel and expensive transmission strategy is  more advantageous than the baseline technology, but it is critical to quantify the impact of more  expensive strategies that may ease regulatory obligations. The results suggest that further  improvements of the novel technology are needed to directly compete on a cost basis. In future  work, I plan to explore green hydrogen deployment that considers socio-political factors and a  market evolution element of the technology to understand how different adoption environments or  socio-political attitudes can affect levels of attainment of renewable energy capacity or overall  carbon abatement.",2024,5/20/25 15:59,5/20/25 15:59,5/20/25 15:59,6232291 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 6232291 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research explores several innovative potential solutions, specifically technology that optimizes the sequence of delivery vehicle parking and a novel “hitchhiking” operations concept for package delivery drones. In Chapters 2 and 3, this research investigates parking space schedule optimization through two modeling efforts, one which focuses on a system that receives all requests a day-ahead of time, and the second is a dynamic system that receives requests in real-time and periodically updates parking availability. Both of these studies see benefits from an optimized parking reservation system, but only under certain conditions. The best performance occurs when vehicle arrival time uncertainty is low and requests are received with sufficient lead time. When vehicle arrival uncertainty is high, however, parking schedules may require long buffers between reservations to accommodate late or early arrivals. Adding a buffer inherently reduces the time available for scheduling delivery vehicles and can result in more unscheduled vehicles than the first-come first-serve status quo.  In Chapter 4, this research assesses another technology solution, hitchhiking drones, where a drone lands and transits on a public bus while en-route to the destination, through a comparative analysis of other rapid package delivery methods in San Francisco. Results indicate that for rapid delivery of a single package to a destination, hitchhiking drones provide a competitive balance between speed and CO2 emissions relative to alternative modes such as car, e-bike, direct drone-only, and recharging drone delivery. As a result, if delivery stakeholders can accept a slightly longer delivery time, then hitchhiking drones can remove delivery vehicles from roadway traffic and provide meaningful CO2 savings.  Both of these technologies, parking space optimization and drone delivery strategies, are important potential components of urban logistics that can be beneficial and impactful when applied under the correct conditions. This research helps reveal the factors and conditions that make the technology the most competitive and which scenarios to avoid to prevent negative impacts",2024,5/20/25 15:59,5/20/25 15:59,5/20/25 15:59,78362808 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 78362808 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Aerospace Engineering; FOS: Mechanical engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The abstract reads: U.S federal  and state governments lacked a sufficiently complete, accurate and evolving picture of the  present state of critical manufacturing of medical supplies to respond effectively to COVID-19  and other pandemic emergencies. Government sources of firm data are useful to measure  economic activity and composition in a steady state but are not designed to capture rapid changes  during emergencies. Existing government surveys provide precise and accurate snapshots of U.S.  capabilities, but do not capture the rapidly evolving supply status during a crisis such as the  COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, government officials can make direct requests for information  from companies, they are poorly equipped to do frequent and comprehensive large-scale data  collection. To assess the consequences of this data gap, we used weekly web scraping from (May  30, 2020, to September 7, 2021) of Thomasnet -- a leading North American Manufacturing  industrial sourcing platform -- to develop a real-time and evolving list of firms that during the  pandemic’s most severe shortages self-identified as manufacturing domestically masks,  respirators, or their intermediate inputs. We then validate domestic location status and  manufacturing capabilities via firm websites, information from industry associations, data from  DB Hoovers, and interviews directly with companies. We conclude with new theory on how a  product’s entry costs, capital intensity of production, time to production and market,  technological complexity, and critically to national objectives may influence whether data on  v domestic production capacity of specific products should be collected not all, continuously  (semiconductors), or spun up during shortages (masks).  Paper 2 addresses the question of where are there opportunities for small and medium  sized firms to contribute to an industrial mobilization response? The abstract reads: This paper  investigates the role of short-term economic dynamism in responding to crisis induced supply  shortages. We focus on the domestic manufacturing ramp-up of surgical masks, respirators, and  their intermediary products in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We develop a novel method  for timely identification and validation of the evolving state of domestic manufacturing. To  unpack the activities of domestic manufacturers and related institutions, we triangulate across 56  qualitative interviews, certifications, Thomasnet.com®, industry associations, and other public  data. We find that while large manufacturers could rapidly scale up, onshore, or diversify  production to enter into domestic production of critical medical supplies, these large  manufacturers alone were insufficient to meet the spike in demand. In face of this shortage, small  and medium enterprises (SME), who entered into mask and respirator production as de novo  firms, spin-offs, and by diversifying, were important in increasing overall domestic capacity and  serving markets unmet by large hospital distributors. We propose new theory for how and when  federal and state governments should support short-term economic dynamism (firm entry into  target products and/or markets) during crises to address supply shortages, and the types of  market and network failures federal or state governments may be most effective at addressing.   Paper 3 highlights regional and industrial variation in manufacturing activity. The  abstract reads: We introduce a novel and nuanced measure of agglomeration with two  components that differentiate between horizontal (co-location with the own/peer industries) and  vertical (co-location with suppliers) agglomeration. Using employment and establishment data at the US county level and the six-digit industry level, we demonstrate that industries and regions  vary in their degree of vertical versus horizontal agglomeration, and only certain regions appear  to support high levels of both types of agglomeration. Moreover, we find that industry-level  differences in horizontal versus vertical agglomeration are correlated with industry  characteristics. Industries that rely more heavily on physical inputs are correlated with vertical  (supplier) agglomeration while more R&amp;D intensive industries are correlated with horizontal  (peer) agglomeration. These differences are overlooked with existing agglomeration measures.  This research offers important implications for regional and industrial policy interventions.",2024,5/20/25 16:00,5/20/25 16:00,5/20/25 16:00,11104356 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 11104356 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this thesis, I assess the efficacy of different policy strategies focusing on the abatement of CO2, LAP, and both simultaneously. The thesis begins by examining whether preserving existing nuclear plants is a cost-effective means for avoiding CO2 emissions. Following the nuclear analysis, I broaden the scope of my work to include all<br>sectors of the U.S. energy system. Using the Environmental Protection Agency’s TIMES model, I simulate energy-system taxes on CO2 as well as on LAPs, including sulfur<br>dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter 2.5 micro-meters in diameter and below (PM2.5). Additionally, I compare the efficacy of LAP tax scenarios at a<br>national and regional level. Across Chapters 3-4, I compare total emissions across multiple simulated tax scenarios to a business as usual scenario. Additionally, using<br>integrated assessment reduced complexity models, I estimate damages from CO2 and LAPs emissions across these scenarios. To measure the efficiency of tax scenarios in this thesis, I model the net-benefits compared to BAU across multiple environmental policies. In Chapter 2, I examine whether preserving existing U.S. nuclear power plants is a cost-effective strategy to avoid CO2 emissions. I perform a Monte Carlo-based analysis to determine the break-even price of electricity that each U.S. nuclear plant must receive in order to avoid financial loses between 2015 and 2040. Subsequently, I model nuclear power plant revenue under four separate future prices of electricity. Under the lowest electric price trajectory, my modeled results suggest that nuclear power plants would require a subsidy in order to break-even. Under the low electric price scenario, assuming natural gas combined-cycle power plants would replace nuclear power plants, I estimate the median cost of avoided CO2 emissions to range from $18-$30 per metric ton of avoided CO2 for multi-reactor plants, and $47-$97 per metric ton of avoided CO2 for single reactor plants (2014$). In Chapter 3, I simulate business as usual as well as two CO2 tax policies from 2015 to 2030 on the United States energy system, using the TIMES optimization model. I<br>find limited near-term decarbonization opportunities outside of the power generation sector, which results in substantial and enduring CO2 tax revenue through 2030. Second,<br>because the social cost of carbon, and therefore the optimal CO2 tax, is uncertain, I perform analysis comparing the deadweight loss associated with picking the wrong, nonoptimal CO2 tax. Due to the convex nature of the CO2 abatement cost curve implicit in the TIMES model, I find that it is more efficient to tax high when the social cost of<br>carbon is low, versus taxing low when the social cost of carbon is high. Additionally, I quantify the co-benefits of LAP emissions reductions that occur under both CO2 tax<br>policies. In Chapter 4, I use energy system and integrated assessment models for air pollution to estimate the consequences of LAP and CO2 policy on technology choice,<br>emissions, and pollution damages in the U.S. economy. Chapter 4 explores various combinations of policies targeting just CO2, just LAPs, and both types of pollutants<br>simultaneously. One goal is to assess whether simultaneous tax policies on both LAPs and CO2 are needed or whether significant spillovers merit control of only LAPs or CO2.<br>I find substantial spillovers across policies, that a scenario taxing both CO2 and LAPs simultaneously produces the highest net-benefits, as opposed to scenarios that target<br>either CO2 or LAPs, and that the timing of taxes is important with regard to technology lock-in in the electric sector.<br>Also in Chapter 4, I simulate national and regional taxes levied on the emission of LAPs from the U.S. energy system. I estimate the efficiency gains, relative to BAU, from<br>taxation of LAPs under two systems: in one scenario taxes are set to the emission weighted average marginal damage on a national level and the other employs a 9-region<br>taxation system on SO2, NOx, and PM2.5, where the regions are defined according to U.S. census regions. I find that both national and regional taxes induce substantial and nearly<br>identical reductions in the emissions of SO2, NOx, and PM2.5. Importantly, across regions and sectors, there is not a substantial difference in emissions between the national and regional tax scenarios. As a result, the modeled welfare gains stemming from policy differentiation are minimal. It is important to note that the lack of an increase in net benefits<br>between the national and regional tax scenarios is likely due to the lack of additional abatement options built into TIMES, which does not allow additional regional abatement in many sectors, regardless of whether there is a substantial tax increase. <br>",2020,5/20/25 16:00,5/20/25 16:00,5/20/25 16:00,3054350 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 3054350 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This can only be accomplished through, among other things, a massive transformation of a deeply unpredictable global energy<br>system on which billions of people depend. This thesis aims to illustrate three methodologically distinct approaches that could be integrated into a framework for energy decision-making capable of guiding thoughtful and equitable planning for robust reductions in GHG emissions in the face of deep, largely irreducible uncertainty. Although the primary object of study is the US energy system, all three analyses aim to draw generalizable conclusions that are useful in other<br>contexts. Chapter 2 attempts to characterize the predictability and volatility of the US energy system by<br>analyzing errors in past US government projections and historical fluctuations in the price, production, and consumption of key energy quantities. This work finds that the period from 2005-2014 contained a disproportionate number of the largest projection errors and inter-year<br>fluctuations in almost all of the 17 quantities examined. This indicates that the US energy system itself was more volatile and harder to predict in this period than in previous decades.<br>Chapter 3 uses observational residential electricity consumption data to estimate the effect of a low-income electric subsidy on electricity demand, and the externality costs associated with increased electricity generation and higher peak demand. This work finds that the externality<br>costs are on the order of 11% of total subsidy disbursements, with no significant change in this<br>number if intra-day estimates are used instead of time-invariant estimates. Decarbonization of the electric power system will likely eliminate most emissions from power plants, leaving only capacity costs of roughly 5% of subsidy disbursements. Thus, policy makers considering low income<br>subsidies as a means of ensuring that low-income households do not disproportionately bear the burden of an energy transition can use such estimates of price responsiveness to estimate any adjustments in peak capacity requirements that may result from increased demand. Chapter 4 uses an optimization-based techno-economic model to characterize the decision space<br>for deep decarbonization of liquid-dependent sectors such as aviation and long-distance road transportation. With today’s technology electrofuels, synthetic hydrocarbons produced using CO2 captured from the atmosphere and hydrogen from electrolysis of water, are likely a more<br>expensive mitigation strategy than continuing to use petroleum-based fuels and offsetting the resulting emissions with direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 with sequestration (DACS). However, if DAC and electrolyzer manufacturers are able to meet near-term cost targets, electrofuels may<br>be competitive with DACS if the cost of petroleum fuels rises substantially or if sequestration costs are higher than anticipated. Several decades into the future, electrofuel costs may fall as low as $2.70 per gallon of gasoline equivalent, potentially achieving cost parity with petroleum<br>fuels. Electrofuel cost is most sensitive to the capital cost the DAC, electrolyzer, and renewable electricity systems, confirming their importance as priorities for research, development, and deployment (RD&amp;D). However, without the operational flexibility afforded by storage or supplementary natural gas or grid electricity interconnections, costs could rise by more than 80%. This points to some less intuitive RD&amp;D priorities, such as metallic phase change materials<br>capable of storing heat above 900°C and low-cost, seasonal CO2 storage. As a whole, this work aims to characterize the depth the uncertainties posed by the task of energy<br>transition while synthesizing insights from analysis of historical data and modeling based on engineering knowledge and expert judgment to gain policy-relevant insights into pathways toward deep decarbonization of the energy system. I hope this represents a small step toward a<br>decision-making paradigm capable of addressing the deep uncertainties we face while using the wealth of data and insight at our disposal to chart a thoughtful course ahead. <br>",2019,5/20/25 17:13,5/20/25 17:13,5/20/25 17:13,5699134 Bytes,,,,,,Decisions and Uncertainties in the US Energy System,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 5699134 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this dissertation, we investigate the equity impact of external changes in transportation (e.g., COVID-19 and dependence on public transportation) and the impact of internal disruptions to transportation (e.g., technology innovations, such as vehicle electrification and automation). We investigated COVID-19 because it created unprecedented upheaval in transportation patterns and revealed vulnerabilities in the transportation system that were not discernible pre-pandemic. Looking forward, the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) will present a lower-emissions alternative to internal combustion engines. This is significant because light-duty vehicles are the largest sector source of carbon emissions in the US. However, vehicle electrification will change how people re-fuel their vehicles and will impact grid operations. We investigate EV adoption and infrastructure to discern who will be left behind and how the EV movement will impact the state of the grid.  In the second chapter, we investigate the role that public transportation potentially played as a vector for spreading COVID-19 and assess the trade-offs of potential alternatives to crowding on public transit. We find that some trips have demands that exceed their COVID-19 passenger limit, where the driver must decide: 1) leaving a passenger without a ride or 2) allowing them on the bus and increasing COVID-19 risk. We consider five alternatives for alleviating overcapacity and compare the trade-offs of each. We use transit ridership and COVID-19 data from the spring of 2020 by combining transportation data and a stochastic epidemiological model of COVID-19 in a Monte Carlo Analysis. Our results show that 4% of county cases were contracted on the bus or from a bus rider, and a disproportionate amount (52%) were from overcapacity trips. The risk of contracting COVID-19 on the bus was low but worth mitigating.  In the third chapter, we use the COVID-19 stay-at-home order to study the dependence on Transportation Network Companies (TNC) by income of the trip origin. TNCs such as Uber and Lyft set out to provide transportation that was not fulfilled by private vehicles or public transit. The social value of TNCs for essential trips is difficult to discern in normal conditions. The COVID-19 stay-at-home order is used as a natural experiment to investigate the heterogeneous ability to avoid TNCs by income areas of trip origins. We measure the sensitivity of different populations’ ability to respond to policies and to avoid TNC trips (e.g., early stay-at-home orders) using a difference-in-difference style regression. We fill a gap in the literature by evaluating the role TNCs play in serving unavoidable and essential trips. We find that high-income community areas showed greater sensitivity to the stay-at-home order with a 56% greater decrease in TNC ridership during the stay-at-home order compared to low-income community areas.  In the fourth chapter, we investigate the impact of federal investments in public charging station access for Electric vehicles (EVs) to find where coverage is lacking and which parts of the country are left behind by federal spending. EV charging stations need EVs to be profitable, while consumers hesitate to purchase EVs if there is a lack of charging infrastructure. The federal government has committed to investing up to $7.5 billion into publicly accessible EV charging infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Several highway corridors are designated as alternative fuel corridors (AFC) and are prioritized for fast charging station development. We develop a novel metric, ‘consecutive coverage’, to compute the percent of roads (weighted by traffic) that are consecutively accessible, with?out large gaps in charging stations, within 500 miles of each starting county. We use our metric to answer several questions: What is the state of consecutive EV charging coverage from each county? What is the increase in coverage per state when the federally designated corridors have fast charging stations? The output of our model is the percent of national coverage reached for each county in the US. In 2023, only 10% of counties have minimum viable coverage, with at least 75% of highways consecutively covered for long-distance travel. If all AFCs have fast charging stations, 94% of counties will have consecutive coverage of fast chargers for at least 75% of travel.  In the fifth chapter, we look at the impact of EVs on grid capacity expansion, generation mix, and emissions. There are several EV policies and federal goals aimed at reducing carbon emissions; however, to understand the impact of EV adoption on carbon emissions, we investigate the impact of high EV penetration on the grid needs by endogenously modeling dispatch and capacity expansion. We find that high EV penetration scenarios (the Biden Administration 2021 EV sales goal, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2024 fuel standards, and net zero by 2050) have higher consequential emissions compared to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (inducing a higher carbon intensity of the grid). However, the consequential per-vehicle emissions fall over time to nearly reach zero per-vehicle consequential emissions by 2050 compared to the IRA reference. The grid’s carbon intensity is anticipated to decrease significantly over the next decade leading to a reduction in consequential EV emissions of high EV policies; this widens the gap between per vehicle EV grid emissions and displaced tailpipe emission out through 2032, at which point the consequential per vehicle emissions stays consistent across high EV scenarios. We model the lowest EV scenario (no policy intervention) as reaching emissions low enough to trigger the phase-out of IRA renewable tax credits. The higher EV policies maintain positive grid emissions beyond the IRA but have significantly lower displaced tailpipe emissions for 2026 onward.",2024,5/20/25 17:09,5/20/25 17:09,5/20/25 17:09,41872081 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 41872081 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy conservation are all commonly suggested solutions. Such interventions may provide health and environmental benefits by displacing emissions from conventional power plants. However, the generation mix varies considerably from region to region and emissions vary by the type and age of a generator. Thus, the benefits of an intervention will depend on the specific generators that are displaced, which vary depending on the timing and location of the intervention. Marginal emissions factors (MEFs) give a consistent measure of the avoided emissions per megawatt-­‐hour of displaced electricity, which can be used to evaluate the change in emissions resulting from a variety of interventions. This thesis presents the first systematic calculation of MEFs for the U.S. electricity system. Using regressions of hourly generation and emissions data from 2006 through 2011, I estimate regional MEFs for CO2, NOx, and SO2, as well as the share of marginal generation from coal-­‐, gas-­‐, and oil-­‐fired generators. This work highlights significant regional differences in the emissions benefits of displacing a unit of electricity: compared to the West, displacing one megawatt-­‐hour of electricity in the Midwest is expected to avoid roughly 70% more CO2, 12 times more SO2, and 3 times more NOx emissions. I go on to explore regional variations in the performance of wind turbines and solar panels, where performance is measured relative to three objectives: energy production, avoided CO2 emissions, and avoided health and environmental damages from criteria pollutants. For 22 regions of the United States, I use regressions of historic emissions and generation data to estimate marginal impact factors, a measure of the avoided health and environmental damages per megawatt-­‐ hour of displaced electricity. Marginal impact factors are used to evaluate the effects of an additional wind turbine or solar panel in the U.S. electricity system. I find that the most attractive sites for renewables depend strongly on one’s objective. A solar panel in Iowa displaces 20% more CO2 emissions than a panel in Arizona, though energy production from the Iowa panel is 25% less. Similarly, despite a modest wind resource, a wind turbine in West Virginia is expected to displace 7 times more health and environmental damages than a wind turbine in Oklahoma. Finally, I shift focus and explore the economics of small-­‐scale cogeneration, which has long been recognized as a more efficient alternative to central-­‐station power. Although the benefits of distributed cogeneration are widely cited, adoption has been slow in the U.S. Adoption could be encouraged by making cogeneration more economically attractive, either by increasing the expected returns or decreasing the risks of such investments. I present a case study of a 300-­‐kilowatt cogeneration unit and evaluate the expected returns from: demand response, capacity markets, regulation markets, accelerated depreciation, a price on CO2 emissions, and net metering. In addition, I explore the effectiveness of feed-­‐in tariffs at mitigating the energy-­‐price risks to cogeneration projects.",8/1/12,5/20/25 17:38,5/20/25 17:38,5/20/25 17:38,,,,,,,Evaluating Interventions in the U.S. Electricity System,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716483.v1,,"/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/SQSN7HPC/Siler-Evans - 2012 - Evaluating Interventions in the U.S. Electricity System Assessments of Energy Efficiency, Renewable.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both discuss new fuel types, but neither provides methodological guidelines for dealing with the inherent uncertainty in evaluating their potential life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions reductions are based on point estimates only. This work develops a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate life-cycle emissions distributions from ethanol and butanol from corn or switchgrass. Life-cycle emissions distributions for each of the modelled feedstock and fuel pairings span an order of magnitude or more. Corn ethanol emissions range from 50 to 200 g CO2e/MJ, and each feedstock-fuel pathway studied shows some probability of greater emissions than a distribution for gasoline. Potential GHG emissions reductions from displacing fossil fuels with biofuels are difficult to forecast given this high degree of uncertainty in life-cycle emissions. Incorporating uncertainty in the decision making process can illuminate the risks of policy failure (e.g., increased emissions), and a calculated risk of failure due to uncertainty can be used to inform more appropriate reduction targets in future biofuel policies. The current practice of modelling cellulosic biomass yields based on point values that have been aggregated over space and over time conceal important energy supply risks related to depending on biomass for transportation energy, particularly those related to local drought conditions. Using switchgrass as a case study, this work quantifies the variability in expected yields over time and space with a switchgrass growth model and historical weather data. Even with stable, productive states, yields vary from 5 to 20 Mg/ha. Yields are likely to be reduced with increased temperatures and weather variability induced by climate change. Thus, variability needs to be a central part of biomass systems modelling so that risks to energy supplies are acknowledged and risk mitigation strategies or contingency plans are considered. Irrigation, a potential risk mitigation strategy, can very often negate the impacts of drought, although system-wide irrigation is an expensive method to stabilize crops (costing $0.10 to $1.90/gallon). Unless many surplus acres of cellulosic crops are planted, there will be insufficient ethanol to meet the EISA targets 10 to 25% of the time under rain-fed conditions. Thinking in terms of yield ranges, not point estimates, is essential in planning a long-term energy system dependent on biomass.",12/1/12,5/20/25 17:37,5/20/25 17:37,5/20/25 17:37,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716471.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/P4UWQ5VK/Mullins - 2012 - Evaluating Biomass Energy Policy in the Face of Emissions Reductions Uncertainty and Feedstock Suppl.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decisions of interest include those around data sourcing, sampling, clustering, temporal magnification, algorithm selection, testing approach, evaluation metrics, and others. Models of the forecasting process and analysis methods are formulated in terms of a three-tier decision taxonomy, by which decision effects are exposed through systematic enumeration of the techniques resulting from those decisions. A computation platform based on the models is implemented to compute and visualize the effects. The methods and computation platform are first demonstrated by applying them to 3,003 benchmark datasets to investigate various decisions, including those that could impact the relationship between data entropy and forecastability. Then, they are used to study over 10,624 week-ahead and day-ahead residential electricity demand forecasting techniques, utilizing fine-resolution electricity usage data collected over 18 months on groups of 782 and 223 households by real smart electric grids in Ireland and Australia, respectively. The main finding from this research is that forecasting performance is highly sensitive to the interaction effects of many decisions. Sampling is found to be an especially effective data strategy, clustering not so, temporal magnification mixed. Other relationships between certain decisions and performance are surfaced, too. While these findings are empirical and specific to one practically scoped investigation, they are potentially generalizable, with implications for residential electricity demand estimation, smart electric grid design, and electricity policy.",5/1/17,5/20/25 17:34,5/20/25 17:34,5/20/25 17:34,,,,,,,Evaluating Forecasting Performance in the Context of Process-Level Decisions,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716474.v1,,"/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/MRQ6FJ6Y/Huntsinger - 2017 - Evaluating Forecasting Performance in the Context of Process-Level Decisions Methods, Computation P.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EA4JGPMK,thesis,2017,"Gingerich, Daniel Beryl",Evaluating and Avoiding Risk Tradeoffs in Water Treatment,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Evaluating_and_Avoiding_Risk_Tradeoffs_in_Water_Treatment/6716468/1,"Treating water in order to reduce human and environmental risks requires the use of electricity and chemicals, the generation of which creates emissions of air pollutants such as NOx, SO2, PM2.5, and CO2. Emissions of air pollutants establishes a health and environmental risk tradeoff between air and water pollution. Addressing air-water tradeoffs by adopting a one environment framework requires new methods for quantifying these tradeoffs, new technologies to minimize air-water tradeoffs, and new tools for decision makers to incorporate these tradeoffs into compliance decisions. In my thesis, I develop methods for quantifying damages from air emissions associated with water treatment; assess the feasibility of forward osmosis (FO), a technology which holds the promise to avoid air-water tradeoffs; and create a tool to holistically assess compliance with air and water emission standards for coal-fired power plants (CFPPs). I start my thesis by creating a method to quantify the damages caused by the air emissions that resulting from the treatment of drinking water (Chapter 2), municipal wastewater (Chapter 3), and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater (Chapter 4). These studies use life-cycle models of energy and chemical consumption for individual water treatment unit processes in order to estimate embedded emissions of criteria air pollutants and greenhouse gasses per cubic meter of treated water. Damages from these additional air emissions are assessed and incorporated into benefit-cost analyses. I find that for drinking water rules, the net benefit of currently implemented rules remains positive but the promises of net benefits for some proposed rules are conditional on the compliance technology that is selected. For municipal wastewater, I find that while there are ~$240 million (in 2012 USD) benefits in air emission reduction from installing biogas-fueled electricity generation nationwide, there are several states where biogas-fueled electricity creates more air emissions than it displaces. For FGD wastewater treatment, I find that complying with the effluent limitation guidelines has an expected ratio of benefits to cost of1.7-1.8, with damages concentrated in regions with large chemical manufacturing industries or electricity grids that are heavily reliant on coal. In the next part of the thesis, I assess the techno-economic feasibility of power plant waste heat driven FO to reduce the air emissions associated with FGD wastewater treatment. In Chapter 5, I assess the quantity, quality and the spatial and temporal availability of waste heat from US coal, nuclear, and natural gas power plants. I find that while 18.9 billion GJ of potentially recoverable waste heat is discharged into the environment, only 900 million GJ of that heat is from the flue gas and is at a temperature high enough to drive water purification using forward osmosis (FO). In Chapter 6, I build a model of FO to assess its thermal energy consumption and find that the 900 million GJ of waste heat produced at coal and natural gas power plants is sufficient to meet their boiler feedwater and FGD wastewater treatment needs. In Chapter 7, I incorporate cost into the energy consumption model of FO, and conclude that treatment of FGD and gasification wastewater using waste heat driven FO is economically competitive with mechanical vapor recompression. In Chapter 8, I create an energy-balance model of a CFPP and nine environmental control technologies for compliance with FGD wastewater and carbon capture regulations. I use this model to maximize plant revenue at the National Energy Technology Laboratory’s 550 MW model CFPP without carbon capture. I find that revenue is maximized by using residual heat for water treatment or carbon capture. If both carbon capture and zero liquid discharge water treatment regulatory standards are in place, I conclude that the plant maximizes revenue by allocating residual heat and steam to amine-based carbon capture and electricity to mechanical vapor recompression for FGD wastewater treatment.",8/1/17,5/20/25 17:33,5/20/25 17:33,5/20/25 17:33,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716468.v1,,/Users/garrettkent/Zotero/storage/XH7F6NM7/Gingerich - 2017 - Evaluating and Avoiding Risk Tradeoffs in Water Treatment.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83N4PXQB,journalArticle,2016,"Seki, Stephanie M.","Evaluating the Economic, Environmental and Policy Impacts of Ethanol as a Transportation Fuel in Pennsylvania",,,,10.1184/R1/6716486.V1,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/Evaluating_the_Economic_Environmental_and_Policy_Impacts_of_Ethanol_as_a_Transportation_Fuel_in_Pennsylvania/6716486/1,"Natural gas is a growing energy source in the US for various end-uses, and its potential future as a transportation fuel has been the focus of recent policy discussions. Nationally, ethanol is blended with gasoline up to 10% for conventional vehicles, and up to 85% (E85) for use in Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFVs). Federal mandates require increasing ethanol use in the transportation sector. Meeting the mandates could mean increasing the blend in conventional gasoline, or increasing the use of E85 in FFVs. This dissertation explores the economic, environmental and policy effects from producing ethanol from natural gas, and generally expanding access to ethanol as a transportation fuel (feedstock agnostic). Three processes are considered for producing ethanol from natural gas: (1) autothermal reforming (ATR) with catalytic conversion, (2) TCX, a process that produces intermediate products of methanol and acetic acid, developed by Celanese Corp., and (3) a fermentation process developed by Coskata Inc. I first estimate the cost of producing ethanol from natural gas to power light-duty FFVs in Pennsylvania (PA). Relying on production cost estimates provided by developers and assuming recent natural gas and gasoline prices are good proxies for future prices, I conclude that the cost of producing ethanol with either the Coskata or ATR processes would more likely than not be cheaper than gasoline and corn-based ethanol. However, capital costs from these emerging processes and future natural gas and gasoline prices are highly uncertain. The NGLF ethanol must also have acceptable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, for which an estimate is not currently available in the literature. I find the average life cycle GHG emissions for a 100-yr global warming potential (GWP) are 137 g CO2-eqiuv/MJ (ATR Catalytic), 119 g CO2-eqiuv/MJ (Celanese TCX) and 156 g CO2-eqiuv/MJ (Coskata fermentation), given the uncertainty in some parameters the estimate could be slightly higher or lower. All processes have life cycle emissions well above gasoline, and the 20% reduction from gasoline required by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2). Even in the unlikely scenario of zero emissions from the upstream processes, NGLF ethanol process and combustion emissions are still larger than gasoline, although with more overlap in the error bars. More detailed life cycle assessments with process modeling could refine the emissions estimates. Existing policies incentivize ethanol produced from renewable sources, but no current policy provisions specifically incentivize the use or production of ethanol produced from natural gas. I conclude the dissertation with estimates of additional refueling costs for an FFV driver and infrastructure costs for expanding E85 access in Pennsylvania. The state recently received government grants for biofuels infrastructure. I find that even with a subsidy to cover average infrastructure costs of $0.03 to $1.48 per gasoline gallon equivalent (gge) for the retailer, the consumer would still incur additional costs for refueling more often with E85. A refueling cost subsidy of $3.60/gge to cover the additional costs is also higher than historical ethanol subsidies. Additionally, a subsidy to encourage E85 use could reduce emissions at a cost equivalent to $1,320/metric ton CO2, which is approximately two orders of magnitude above the average social cost of carbon. Therefore, reducing emissions through more ethanol fuel use is not a cost-effective mitigation strategy.",2016,5/20/25 17:28,5/20/25 17:28,5/20/25 17:28,14043939 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 14043939 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science; 99999 Engineering not elsewhere classified; FOS: Other engineering and technologies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
