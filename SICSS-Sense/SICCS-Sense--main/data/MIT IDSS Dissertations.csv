24KBWBI3,thesis,2013,"Rohrbach, Amanda K.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Implementing technical transitions through schedule-based policy: insights from the Military's Airborne Tactical Network,,,,,,"Due to a need for congestion relief, as well as a projected increase in capacity constraints, the US Military's Airborne Tactical Network (ATN) is at the onset of a technical transition of their communication hardware and software. While the technical challenges appear to be addressed and agreed upon, the particular challenge lies in navigating the social and organizational challenges of decentralized control, stakeholder misalignment, network externalities, bureaucratic organizational procedures, and limited windows of opportunity. To alleviate these sources of resistance, this thesis proposes an incremental transition strategy that minimizes changes to operational procedures and distributes costs/benefits through schedule-based policy. This research developed a quantitative model to simulate a representative environment of aircraft maintenance routines, flight time, and network usage. Using this model, four incremental strategies were compared including regional, stakeholder-specific, platform-specific, and ""big bang"" approaches. By evaluating network performance improvements and representative cost profiles, this thesis contends that utilizing an incremental regional or stakeholder-specific strategy is a valid path forward for the ATN transformation. Additional research is necessary; however, to better understand the social dynamics between stakeholders and the relative magnitude of costs associated with each option. This thesis finally presents a 5th incremental strategy utilizing functional increments, which modifies the technical deployment of the systems by staging levels of upgrades sequentially over time. If this is technically viable, the results would distribute lower levels of costs over time and provide enough benefit to account for several years of anticipated growth in network demand.",2013,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,Implementing technical transitions through schedule-based policy,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2013 S.M.,Book Title: Implementing technical transitions through schedule-based policy : insights from the Military's Airborne Tactical Network,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two years later, in 2014, the President outlined 19 new executive actions to improve the lives of service members with a focus on improving access to mental health care. These actions placed a priority on improving the capacity to provide mental health care. This thesis examines ways of improving the capacity of the mental health system with a focus on system redesign. I review capacity planning, provide a literature review of simulation methods and present a simulation, and data analysis of Site Alpha, a U.S. Army Installation. I also use causal loop diagrams to explore other feasible scenarios that affect care capacity. The key take-away from this work is that system inefficiencies should be dealt with before more resources can be effectively added and used in the system. Another pertinent finding is that the distribution of the providers in the system should be improved. The system also contains high utilizer patients who must be considered when planning for care. The mental health system is extremely complex and risks becoming even more complex. However, by adopting a holistic, systems approach to capacity planning the complexity can be managed.",2015,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Data analysis and simulation approach to capacity planning,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chapter 2 quantities the effects of I/M programs on road fatalities by applying panel specifications to a data set covering all 50 U.S. states over a 44-year period. Fixed effects (FE) estimates suggest that states with I/M programs had 5.5% fewer roadway fatalities per 100,000 registered passenger vehicles each year. A supporting two-stage least-squares (2SLS) specification also implies causality. Chapter 3 proposes transparent models to identify over-emitting vehicles, using only data which may be collected over-the-air through telematics systems. These modelswere up to 24% more accurate than the current test methodology, in a stratified data sample. These statistical models are a proof-of-concept for I/M programs where jurisdictions may remotely identify over-emitting vehicles, without requiring a physical inspection. Chapter 4 breaks down the annualized user costs of emissions inspection programs. An assessment of data from Pennsylvania finds that in 2016, the average user cost was $56 per vehicle—which includes $44 in test fees, $3 in repair costs, and $9 in indirect costs. Further, the results show that costs vary substantially: that on average, older vehicles have lower test fees but higher repair costs, and that vehicle owners in neighborhoods with lower median incomes or more minority residents may pay more in test fees and repair costs. The proliferation of telematics, driver assistance technologies, and electric vehicles is ushering in an era of ‘intelligent’ transportation systems. As modern vehicles rely on increasingly large amounts of data, this dissertation presents a case for why the regulations and policies governing their inspection and maintenance, may be improved by leveraging data-driven assessments and models.",7/8/22,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,,,,,,,"Effective, Fair, and Over-the-Air",,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/20110292.v1,,"/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/PYJTSXFG/Acharya - 2022 - Effective, Fair, and Over-the-Air Data-driven policy recommendations for passenger vehicle inspecti.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25W64FWG,thesis,2012,"Jathar, Shantanu Hemant",Modeling Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation From Emissions of Combustion Sources,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Modeling_Secondary_Organic_Aerosol_Formation_From_Emissions_of_Combustion_Sources/6720698/1,"Atmospheric aerosols exert a large influence on the Earth’s climate and cause adverse public health effects, reduced visibility and material degradation. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), defined as the aerosol mass arising from the oxidation products of gas-phase organic species, accounts for a significant fraction of the submicron atmospheric aerosol mass. Yet, there are large uncertainties surrounding the sources, atmospheric evolution and properties of SOA. This thesis combines laboratory experiments, extensive data analysis and global modeling to investigate the contribution of semi-volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds (SVOC and IVOC) from combustion sources to SOA formation. The goals are to quantify the contribution of these emissions to ambient PM and to evaluate and improve models to simulate its formation. To create a database for model development and evaluation, a series of smog chamber experiments were conducted on evaporated fuel, which served as surrogates for real-world combustion emissions. Diesel formed the most SOA followed by conventional jet fuel / jet fuel derived from natural gas, gasoline and jet fuel derived from coal. The variability in SOA formation from actual combustion emissions can be partially explained by the composition of the fuel. Several models were developed and tested along with existing models using SOA data from smog chamber experiments conducted using evaporated fuel (this work, gasoline, fischertropschs, jet fuel, diesels) and published data on dilute combustion emissions (aircraft, on- and off-road gasoline, on- and off-road diesel, wood burning, biomass burning). For all of the SOA data, existing models under-predicted SOA formation if SVOC/IVOC were not included. For the evaporated fuel experiments, when SVOC/IVOC were included predictions using the existing SOA model were brought to within a factor of two of measurements with minor adjustments to model parameterizations. Further, a volatility-only model suggested that differences in the volatility of the precursors were able to explain most of the variability observed in the SOA formation. For aircraft exhaust, the previous methods to simulate SOA formation from SVOC and IVOC performed poorly. A more physically-realistic modeling framework was developed, which was then used to show that SOA formation from aircraft exhaust was (a) higher for petroleumbased than synthetically derived jet fuel and (b) higher at lower engine loads and vice versa. All of the SOA data from combustion emissions experiments were used to determine source-specific parameterizations to model SOA formation from SVOC, IVOC and other unspeciated emissions. The new parameterizations were used to investigate their influence on the OA budget in the United States. Combustion sources were estimated to emit about 2.61 Tg yr-1 of SVOC, IVOC and other unspeciated emissions (sixth of the total anthropogenic organic emissions), which are predicted to double SOA production from combustion sources in the United States. The contribution of SVOC and IVOC emissions to global SOA formation was assessed using a global climate model. Simulations were performed using a modified version of GISS GCM II’. The modified model predicted that SVOC and IVOC contributed to half of the OA mass in the atmosphere. Their inclusion improved OA model-measurement comparisons for absolute concentrations, POA-SOA split and volatility (gas-particle partitioning) globally suggesting that atmospheric models need to incorporate SOA formation from SVOC and IVOC if they are to reasonably predict the abundance and properties of aerosols. This thesis demonstrates that SVOC/IVOC and possibly other unspeciated organics emitted by combustion sources are very important precursors of SOA and potentially large contributors to the atmospheric aerosol mass. Models used for research and policy applications need to represent them to improve model-predictions of aerosols on climate and health outcomes. The improved modeling frameworks developed in this dissertation are suitable for implementation into chemical transport models.",8/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720698.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
268KRD4J,thesis,2009,"Sasanuma, Katsunobu; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Operations Research Center",Policies for parking pricing derived from a queueing perspective,,,,,,"Drivers in urban neighborhoods who cruise streets, seeking inexpensive on-street parking create a significant fraction of measured traffic congestion. The solution to this problem is to reduce the total traffic volume including cruising traffic by implementing a congestion pricing scheme: the imposition of a usage fee on a limited-capacity resource during times of high demand. We review the history of two alternatives for implementing the scheme: road pricing, which involves cordoning off a section of the center city and imposing a fee on all vehicles that enter it; and parking pricing, which increases the costs of on-street and perhaps off-street parking. We find that parking pricing is often a needed companion to road pricing, since in many environments a significant fraction of drivers are simply cruising, looking for inexpensive on-street parking. However, the effectiveness of parking pricing is difficult to analyze quantitatively because vehicles cruising for parking are not clearly distinguishable from other vehicles. We view that the pool of drivers cruising at any time can be modeled as a queue, where 'queue service' is the act of parking in a recently vacated parking space and queue discipline is SIRO - Service In Random Order. We develop a queueing model of such driver behavior, allowing impatient drivers to abandon the queue and to settle for expensive off-street parking. We then relate the model to the economic theory of congestion pricing, arguing that price differentials between on-street and off-street parking should be reduced in order to reduce traffic congestion. Using the ""Parking Queue"" model and collected data, we estimate that less than half of cruising drivers successfully find a vacant spot and the number of cruising vehicles is 10-20% of the total number of parking spaces during peak hours in the most congested area in Boston.",2009,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2009 S.M.,Book Title: Policies for parking pricing derived from a queueing perspective,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Operations Research Center,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The work introduces and applies a novel approach to estimate interruption costs as loss in consumer surplus due to restricted consumption of electricity services. Chapter 2 reports an assessment that compares grid extension with distributed generation (DG) alternatives, based on the subsidies they will necessitate, and costs of service interruptions that are appropriate in the rural Indian context. Despite the inclusion of interruption costs, standalone DG does not appear to be competitive with grid extension at distances of less than 17 km. However, backing up unreliable grid service with local DG plants is attractive when reliability is very poor, even in previously electrified villages. Introduction of energy efficient lighting changes these economics, and the threshold for acceptable grid unreliability significantly reduces. Chapter 3 analyzes supply rostering (alternatively, “load shedding”) in metropolitan, small town and rural feeders in and around Bangalore city. The inequity in load shedding is analyzed through transfers due to differential tariffs between the urban and rural residential consumers, and the relief provided to BESCOM, through avoided procurement of additional supply from generators, because rural and small town feeders are load shed higher than Bangalore city. The values of the load shedding transfers are estimated to be in the range of Rs. 120-380/consumer-year from the rural consumers, and Rs. 220- 370/consumer-year from the small town consumers. The metropolitan consumers are found to be net beneficiaries. The viability of using smart meters to provide current limited but uninterrupted supply is investigated as one alternative to outright blackouts. Chapter 4 develops a broader theoretical framework that can be used to model consumer demand for electricity services with unreliable supply and adaptation. Demand for energy ‘services’ is modeled by incorporating time of use, duration and deferability. Supply reliability is disaggregated into its constituent dimensions– mean and variance of supply availability in times of high demand, and supply predictability, and their respective impacts on consumer welfare are discussed. Primary data collected from Karnataka inform the discussion, especially with backup adoption. New consumer-oriented reliability indices are proposed.",8/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:57,5/20/25 15:23,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714551.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/NZ4UUPDX/Harish - 2014 - Access to Electricity in Rural India Tradeoffs and Interventions for Meaningful Electrification.pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29GFC4S5,thesis,2017,"Zhang, Xiaochen",Welfare Properties of Recommender Systems,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Welfare_Properties_of_Recommender_Systems/6724262/1,"Recommender systems are ubiquitously used by online vendors as profitable tools to boost sales and enhance the purchase experience of their consumers. In recent literature, the value created by recommender systems are discussed extensively. In contrast, few researchers look at the negative side of the recommender systems from the viewpoint of policymakers. To fill this gap, I critically investigate the welfare impact of recommender systems (RSs) during my Ph.D. study. The main focus of my Ph.D. dissertation is analyzing whether there exists a conflict of interest between the recommendations provider and its consumers in the electronic marketplace. My dissertation is composed of three parts. In Part I, I evaluate empirically whether in the real world, the profit-driven firm will choose a recommendation mechanism that hurts or is suboptimal to its consumers. In Part II, I analyze the role of personalization technology in the RSs from a unique perspective of how personalization resembles price discrimination as a profitable tool to exploit consumer surplus. In part III, I investigate the vendor’s motivation to increase the level of personalization in two-period transactions. As the RSs are designed by the firm, and the firm’s objective is to maximize profits, the RSs might not maximize consumers’ welfare. In Part I of my thesis work, I test the existence of such a conflict of interest between the firm and its consumers. I explore this question empirically with a concrete RS created by our industry collaborator for their Video-on-Demand (VoD) system. Using a large-scale dataset (300,000 users) from a randomized experiment on the VoD platform, I simulate seven RSs based on an exponential demand model with listed movie orders and prices as key inputs, estimated from the experimental dataset. The seven simulated RSs differ by the assignments of listed orders for selected recommended movies. Specifically, assignments are chosen to maximize profits, consumer surplus, social welfare, popularity (IMDB votes and IMDB ratings), and previous sales, as well as random assignments. As a result, the profit-driven recommender system generates 8% less consumer surplus than the consumer-driven RSs, providing evidence for a conflict of interest between the vendor and its consumers. Major e-vendors personalize recommendations by different algorithms that depend on how much and types of consumer information obtained. Therefore, the welfare evaluations of personalized recommendation strategies by empirical methods are hard to generalize. In Part II of my thesis, I base my analysis of personalization in RSs on a conceptual approach. Under an analytic framework of horizontal product differentiation and heterogenous consumer preferences, the resemblance of personalization to price discrimination in welfare properties is presented. Personalization is beneficial to consumers when more personalization leads to more adoption of recommendations, since it decreases search costs for more consumers. However, when the level surpasses a threshold when all consumers adopt, a more personalized RS decreases consumer surplus and only helps the firm to exploit surplus from consumers. The extreme case of perfect personalization generates the same welfare results as first-degree price discrimination where consumers get perfectly fit recommendations but are charged their willingness-to-pay. As shown in Part II, personalization is always profitable for the monopoly seller. In Part III, I investigate the vendor’s motivation to increase the level of personalization in a two-period transactions. In the first period, consumers do not observe the true quality of the recommendations and choose to accept recommended products or not based on their initial guesses. In the second period, consumers fully learn the quality. The settings of consumer uncertainty and consumer learning incentivize the firm to charge lower-than-exploiting price for recommendations to ensure consumers’ first-period adoptions of the RS. Therefore, uncertainties mediate the conflicts of interest from the vendor’s exploitive behavior even though the vendor might strategically elevate consumers’ initial evaluation to reduce such effect.",5/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6724262.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of this brings in a growing need for resiliency as the natural gas and electricity systems need to have robust recovery strategies in the face of physical, environmental, cybernetic, security or societal threats. The importance of gas and electricity system resilience increases even further, as the interdependency of the two sectors deepens, especially here in New England, where natural gas now accounts for 50% of region's total power plant capacity. In this thesis, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model of integrated gas and electricity system is used to do contingency analysis and determine components of both systems that are critical to improve resilience. The model's main contribution is that it represents gas dynamics accurately. Using this model, we looked at several threats at the junction of gas and electricity systems. Based on the model results, higher line-pack, and pressures, as well as additional compressor capacity investments, were shown to improve system resiliency. The model could be used as a decision support tool for policy-makers to do contingency analysis of gas-electricity systems.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,Resiliency of interdependent gas and electricity systems,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Resiliency of interdependent gas and electricity systems : the New England case,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2BHGBQLG,thesis,2014,"Accuardi, Zachary A. Campbell; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Resource use in the Chinese building sector: foundations for analyzing urban transition,,,,,,"Around the world, people are moving to cities in order to become wealthy, especially in developing countries undergoing socio-economic transition. This will dramatically change the way that society consumes resources, in terms of both materials and energy. We will need to better understand how resource use changes as development happens in order to focus efforts to reduce that resource use. China is undergoing this transition as it enters the global stage, and with global implications for resource use. The building sector in China is especially resource-intensive, fundamentally driven by the country's urbanization, and plays a prominent role in the Chinese economy, making it a good candidate for the study of how systems adopt sustainable practices. I approach this problem in two ways. The first is quantitative, using k-means statistical clustering on longitudinal resource use data from Chinese statistical yearbooks, in order to identify and compare transitions across provinces in China. In comparing the evolution of the building sector across provinces, my analysis suggests that development pathways are more distinct than discrete development stages. I identify two development pathway 'types' in China. The first is an urban path taken by Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin -- the three most heavily urbanized provinces. All other provinces follow a general business-as-usual path, though I also identify sub-pathways to further differentiate between the other 27 provinces. These development typologies are one means of quantitatively operationalizing the abstract notion of transition. Identifying such pathways may highlight opportunities for learning between provinces within the same path, and one could apply similar methods to other scales of analysis (e.g. urban or national). My second approach is qualitative, driven by interviews conducted primarily in Beijing with various stakeholders in the Chinese building sector. In this analysis, I discuss the particularities of the actors and processes involved in Chinese real estate development, identify opportunities for and barriers to reduced life-cycle energy use in buildings, and describe three distinctive and ongoing sustainability experiments with the potential for significant resource use reductions. This research emphasizes the need for integrated approaches to both research and practice in approaching sustainability transitions, and provides a set of complementary frameworks for their analysis.",2014,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,Resource use in the Chinese building sector,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Resource use in the Chinese building sector : foundations for analyzing urban transition,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2BK3MLKF,thesis,2016,"Kuiper, Jan Jurjen",Making Eco Logic and Models Work: An Integrative Approach to Lake Ecosystem Modelling,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2566021176?pq-origsite=primo,"A principal aim of ecologists is to identify critical levels of environmental change beyond which ecosystems undergo radical shifts in their functioning. Dynamical ecosystem models are tools that can help ecologists to understand complex systems, and turn this understanding into predictions of how these systems respond to external changes. This thesis revolves around PCLake, an integrated ecosystem model of shallow lakes, which is used by both scientists and water quality managers to understand and predict abrupt regime shift in shallow lake ecosystems. Chapter 1 of this thesis presents a general introduction. First the urgency of global environmental change is stressed, along with the responsibility of science to support human societies resolving sustainability issues. Subsequently the argument is made that dynamical models are highly useful tools for obtaining a better understanding of complex systems and for turning this understanding into predictions. The introduction continues with a short review of the important features of shallow lake ecosystems, highlighting that they provide numerous important ecosystem services to human societies, but also showing that lakes are among the most impacted ecosystems on the planet. Thereafter, the most important stress factors to lakes are presented, along with different ways of how lakes may respond to stress. Then the shallow lake ecosystem model PCLake is introduced, which can be used to study and predict the response of lakes to stress. Also the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is introduced, and it is argued that there is huge potential for PCLake to help ecosystem managers reach their WFD targets. Finally the overarching research project is introduced where this thesis is part of. The broad aim of the overall project was to increase the usefulness of PCLake, and its sister model PCDitch, in contemporary science and ecosystem management. The project involved a collaboration between the Netherlands Foundation for Applied Water Research (STOWA), the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW), Wageningen University & Research centre (WUR), the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) and Witteveen+Bos, a private engineering consultancy. The heart of the project consisted of two PhD studies, one on PCLake and one on PCDitch, and quite a few case studies on aquatic ecosystems in the Netherlands. Four objectives were identified as important pillars of the overarching project: (1) to make the models more accessible, (2) to make improvements to the models, (3) to increase our understanding of the models as well as the ecosystems they portray and (4) to explore new applications of the models in lake ecosystem management. The chapters of this thesis follow from these four pillars.In chapter 2, the Database Approach To Modelling (DATM) is introduced, which is invented to make dynamic models more accessible. The idea of DATM is that the mathematical equations of a model are stored in a database independently of program language and software specific information. From the database, the information can be automatically translated, augmented and compiled into working model code of various different modelling frameworks (software programs). This procedure allows for easy switching between frameworks, which facilitates the collaboration between modellers. It also makes it possible to exploit the joint multitude of the tools and analysis provided by the different frameworks. An additional advantage is that working in a database provides structure and overview, which makes it easier for modellers and non-modellers to grasp the mathematical formulations. We describe the approach using the simple Lotka-Volterra predator prey model and exemplify it with the complex model PCLake.In chapter 3 we reflect on the weak link between ecosystem models and real ecosystems and discuss the consequences for calibration and improvement of PCLake. The apparent weak link between a model and reality implies that it will be merely impossible to accurately parameterize all individual model components on basis of empirical data. A solution is oftentimes found in model calibration at an aggregated level, whereby the components are aligned in such a way that together they do an adequate job in describing those ecosystem level variables that are relevant to ecosystem managers, such as total productivity and water transparency. By doing so, any missing dynamics may still be accounted for, albeit indirectly, by modifying the functionality of the components that are explicitly included. An important consequence is that once calibration has been performed, any model 'improvement' in the form of adding more components may bring the model 'out of balance' as it may lead to double counting with the implicit components. To exemplify this line of reasoning the PCLake model was expanded with a filter feeding zoobenthos group. These species are always present in the shallow lakes simulated by PCLake, but were until yet not dealt with explicitly in the model itself but implicitly included in the zooplankton grazing rate during previous calibration. To elucidate how the zooplankton grazing is changed by the explicit inclusion of filter feeding benthos, the original calibration routine was re-established using data from more than 40 lakes. Indeed, it turned out that, to maintain a good fit, the zooplankton grazing rate needs to be lowered. Nevertheless, the analysis showed that calibrating only the zooplankton grazing rate is not sufficient to make the addition of chironomids an improvement to the overall fit of the model.In chapter 4, the relation between complex ecosystem models and empirical food web models is scrutinized. Both modelling paradigms are highly influential in modern ecology as both food-web theory and alternative stable states theory help scientists understand how stability is conferred to complex ecosystems. Unfortunately, it is largely unclear how the concept of food-web stability is associated with the resilience of ecosystems susceptible to regime change, and hence how insights from these different fields can be aligned. In this study we treat PCLake as a virtual reality from which we can sample 'empirical' information to parameterize a food web model, following traditional food web methods. Accordingly, the food web model can be analyzed for its stability using the Jacobian matrix approach. We repeated this exercise along the eutrophication gradient, knowing that PCLake will show a regime shift when a critical nutrient loading is reached. By doing so, we show that impending catastrophic shifts in shallow lakes are preceded by a destabilizing reorganization of interaction strengths in the aquatic food web, and obtain insight in the biological interactions underlying regime shifts in shallow lake.The results of chapter 4 raise the question how exactly stability properties of the ecosystem model are transferred to the empirical food web model. In other words, for a system of consumer resource interactions in equilibrium, is it the exact shape of the functional response of the interactions (e.g. linear vs. nonlinear), or is the patterning of interaction strengths in the network (e.g. degree of omnivory, connectance etc.) that is decisive in determining the stability properties of the system? Given the complexity of PCLake and the produced food web models it is difficult to answer these questions. In chapter 5, the extent to which models of a different form can describe the same natural phenomenon is further addressed. We zoom in on the influence of the functional response terms rather than the number of equations. Using three classical extensions of the famous Lotka-Volterra equations we analyze the consequence of changing a system with a sophisticated functional response term (e.g. Holling type II or III) into a system with a simpler functional response term while maintaining equilibrium densities and material fluxes. We are interested in the extent to which stability properties of a complex system can be reflected by a simpler system. Our main result is that changing nonlinear terms in simple models of consumer resource interactions into linear ones, while maintaining the equilibrium densities and the transfer of mass, has a strong impact on the stability properties of the model system. Although transcritical bifurcations (species extinction/invasion thresholds) are maintained after changing the shape of the interaction terms, the so called hopf and saddle-node bifurcations were lost. Especially the latter is important for ecosystem managers that wish to anticipate and prevent abrupt regime shifts. These results give new insight into when empirical data can be linked to mathematical models to estimate the stability properties of real ecosystems.In chapter 6, a new application of PCLake is presented. Although PCLake is predominantly applied in the context of ecosystem restoration of turbid phytoplanktondominated lakes, this study focusses on the clear water state after the reestablishment of aquatic plant dominance. Dense stands of aquatic plants easily cause nuisance, and hence the removal of aquatic plants is an emerging management issue. Yet, because aquatic plants play an important role in stabilizing the clear water state, the removal of plant biomass can potentially trigger a critical transition back to the turbid water state. Currently there is only limited empirical and theoretical understanding of how harvesting of aquatic plants affects ecosystem functioning, which frustrates effective and efficient ecosystem management.

2E8CWGCT,thesis,2016,"Li, Vivian; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",The Local Reference Electrification Model: comprehensive decision-making tool for the design of rural microgrids,,,,,,"Current estimates indicate that an alarming 1 billion existing people still lack access to electricity around the world. Technological advancements have pushed off-grid solutions into the limelight as possible alternatives to the traditional method of electrification via extension of the centralized grid. When grid reliability is poor, the community is remote, or when the arrival of the grid is undetermined, off-grid systems may be suitable substitutes for traditional grid extension efforts. Nonetheless, severe resource constraints, the scale of planning, and the choice between electrification modes create a complicated environment under which planners in the developing world must devise electrification plans and relevant policies. This thesis demonstrates how computational tools can provide value to rural electrification planning. The Reference Electrification Model (REM) assists planners by identifying optimal regions for grid extension projects and off-grid solutions, along with technical design and associated financial metrics. In particular, this thesis focuses on the discussion of the Local Reference Electrification Model (LREM), an adaption of REM to localized electrification design. LREM is a comprehensive, decision-making tool that produces detailed generation and network designs for a singular microgrid system. It contributes to the electrification effort by providing the quantitative basis with which to explore financial, technical, and performance implications of various factors in microgrid design. In doing so, LREM improves the microgrid designs relied upon by REM in its regional planning decisions. This research emphasizes the ability for computational tools such as REM and LREM to assist in developing viable policies and regulations, as well as feasible designs and plans to accelerate electricity access globally.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,The Local Reference Electrification Model,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: The Local Reference Electrification Model : comprehensive decision-making tool for the design of rural microgrids,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2IKBDN22,thesis,2009,"Anderson, Eric P.","Reformers revealed: American Indian progressives at Haskell Institute, Lawrence, Kansas, 1884-1909",,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/304905951?pq-origsite=primo,"Haskell Institute opened in 1884, an early example of federal off-reservation boarding schools for American Indian youth. The goal was assimilation: strip away traditional languages, spiritual beliefs, tribal customs, even family ties, and replace them with inculcation into the values of Western civilization upheld by white society. In reality, students, whose ages covered a wide range, often clung tenaciously to older, more familiar ideals. This study looks broadly at the effects of this conflict in the mindsets and behaviors of both students and administrators at the school (and similar institutions). Because Haskell’s first quarter-century overlaps with much of the period scholars call “The Progressive Era” in U.S. history, the time frame investigated yields rich data regarding new thinking about educational and social reform. While recent literature on the boarding school system has blossomed, the link between its activities and the larger picture of American Progressivism has not been firmly established within the context of a specific school. By the dawn of the nineteenth century, Haskell Institute was becoming the largest of these federal education outlets, making its success of especial consequence, both because it affected great numbers of students (and their support networks) and served as a model for promoting policy goals. Understanding how Haskell grew and became an increasingly accepted part of the American Indian experience requires the realization that native peoples played an active role in shaping the contours of their own education. While their “partnership” with government functionaries was often limited, the input they provided, through a variety of means, had measurable consequences for the direction and overall influence of the school. In this way, Haskell students (as well as their families, tribal leadership, and a growing vanguard of American Indian elites, themselves often the product of similar educational experiences) may be viewed through the lens of Progressive reform. Precisely defining Progressivism is difficult, but Indians’ active participation at Haskell did affect visible change in their education, and comprised another, overlooked example of Progressives in action. Through attendance records, administrative and curricular changes, personal letters and reminiscences, development of a more native-centered school newspaper, elimination (or tempering) of the most egregious aspects of boarding-school life, or other means, a tangible American Indian Progressivism emerges, with its ultimate aim retention of core elements of native cultures and traditions. Thus they were not simply victims of government or outside social engineering, but active participants in the education process. The intertwining of both federal directives and native hopes in the development of Haskell makes a fascinating case study of Progressive activism and reform, the ability to affect quiet change within an oppressive institutional atmosphere, the recognition of a strong native voice in this period, and the interdependence of the boarding-school system and American Indian peoples in establishing (often quite different) measures of “success” in this education. The survival of Native American peoples, customs, and Haskell itself, as a place today celebrating that persistence, is strong testimony to this Indian Progressivism and the works and lives of those who came before.",2009,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,Reformers revealed,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Reformers revealed: American Indian progressives at Haskell Institute, Lawrence, Kansas, 1884-1909 ISBN: 9781109640472 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 3 Pages: 1059 Volume: 71",,,,,Family; Indians of North America; Indians of South America; Reform; School boards; Schools; Students; Values,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis considers the economic feasibility and environmental effects of integrating demand-side resources into the electric grid with consideration given to the diversity of market and environmental conditions that can affect their behavior. Chapter 2 explores the private economics and system-level carbon dioxide reduction when using demand response for spinning reserve. Steady end uses like lighting are more than twice as profitable as seasonal end uses because spinning reserve is needed year-round. Avoided carbon emission damages from using demand response instead of fossil fuel generation for spinning reserve are sufficient to justify incentives for demand response resources. Chapter 3 quantifies the system-level net emissions rate and private economics of behind-the-meter energy storage. Net emission rates are lower than marginal emission rates for power plants and in-line with estimates of net emission rates from grid-level storage. The economics are favorable for many buildings in regions with high demand charges like California and New York, even without subsidies. Future penetration into regions with average charges like Pennsylvania will depend greatly on installation cost reductions and wholesale prices for ancillary services. Chapter 4 outlines a novel econometric model to quantify potential revenues from energy storage that reduces demand charges. The model is based on a novel predictive metric that is derived from the building’s load profile. Normalized revenue estimates are independent of the power capacity of the battery holding other performance characteristics equal, which can be used to calculate the profit-maximizing storage size. Chapter 5 analyzes the economic feasibility of flow batteries in the commercial and industrial market. Flow batteries at a 4-hour duration must be less expensive on a dollar per installed kWh basis, often by 20-30%, to break even with shorter duration li-ion or lead-acid despite allowing for deeper depth of discharge and superior cycle life. These results are robust to assumptions of tariff rates, battery round-trip efficiencies, amount of solar generation and whether the battery can participate in the wholesale energy and ancillary services markets.",12/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Integrating Demand-Side Resources into the Electric Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720245.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With anticipated increases in population and associated waste generation, timely and effective waste management highlights one of the most critical challenges of sustainable development, which calls for meeting ""the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"" (WCED, 1987). Waste management in urban areas plays a particularly important role, given that waste generated from urban areas are often exported out of the region for processing and treatment, and the impacts of waste disposal activities may pass on to the other jurisdictions, and even to the next generations. An urban system cannot be sustainable if it requires more resources than it can produce on its own and generates more wastes than the environment can assimilate. The current waste management practice, which focuses on short-term impacts and end-of-pipe solutions, is reactive in nature and inadequate to promote sustainability within urban systems, across jurisdictions, and across generations. Through material flows in and out of urban systems, many potential opportunities exist to reduce waste generation and to minimize the negative impacts on the environment, the economy, and the society. City planners' involvement in waste management, however, has been largely limited to siting waste management facilities. Linking waste management with three important lenses in planning - economic development, land use, and environmental planning, this study investigates the impacts of urban growth on waste management activities, the need of transforming the reactive nature of current waste management, and the challenges and opportunities for planners to promote urban systems' self-reliance of material and waste management needs. This study includes three empirical analyses to complement theoretical discussions. First, it connects waste statistics with demographic data, geographic characteristics, and policy instruments at the county level to examine whether waste volume can be decoupled from urban population growth. Second, it examines the life cycle costs of different waste management options and develops a simulation study to seek cost-effective strategies for long-term waste management. Third, it compiles evidence of geographic-specific characteristics related to waste management and demonstrates why waste management policies cannot be one-size-fit-all. This study finds that, with successful implementation of strategic policy design, waste generation and its associated impacts can be decoupled from population and urban growth. Good lessons about waste reduction programs can be learned from different communities. Meanwhile, this study also reveals various challenges facing communities with heterogeneous characteristics, such as housing density, building age, and income. Accordingly, this study discusses the potential opportunities for planners to contribute to community-specific waste management programs, the prospect of transforming waste management practice from a cost burden to a long-term economic development strategy, and the need to incorporate waste management into the sustainable urban planning agenda.",2011,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,Challenges of sustainable urban planning,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,Ann Arbor,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Challenges of sustainable urban planning: The case of municipal solid waste management ISBN: 9781267738783 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 3 Volume: 74,,,,,Cities and towns; City planning; Economic development; Management; Metropolitan areas; Political planning; Public policy; Sustainable development; Urban renewal; Urbanization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substantial electrification of road transport is critical to deep decarbonization. Self-driving technology continues to inch towards wider commercial deployment, despite well-publicized setbacks. Policymaking must grapple with a deeply uncertain technology landscape and trade-offs between multiple societal objectives. I attempt to help inform public policy by carefully navigating the uncertainty present in the deployment of these technologies and highlighting how trade-offs between multiple objectives might materialize. First, I look at the potential energy impact of automation on electric vehicle range. Will electrification and automation of light vehicles develop in sync? I find that automation will incur expected penalties of 10-15% on electric vehicle range, due to the energy consumption of computing and sensors. This suggests that deliberate technology choices towards efficient computing and aerodynamics will be needed to drive electrification of automated vehicles. In long haul trucking, I investigate the potential job impacts from automation of highway driving. I draw on detailed shipment data to show that replacing all highway driving with automated trucking will lead to more than 90% of operator-hours lost to automation. I find limited evidence to support industry claims that increased short haul jobs will compensate for the operator-hours lost on highways. Third, I present a novel agent based model that can answer a series of research questions related to electric vehicle deployment in ridesourcing. Companies such as Uber and Lyft have committed to fully-electrify their fleets by 2030 in the United States. Should policy incentivize larger battery pack sizes or greater investments in dedicated fast-charging infrastructure for ridesourcing? I instantiate the agent based model to study the lifecycle externalities of fully-electric ridesourcing in the city of Chicago, across different levels of battery size and fast-charging infrastructure. I estimate that greenhouse gas externalities are in the range of 10-13¢ per trip, with lower externalities associated with smaller battery packs. Compared to today, fully electrifying ridesourcing can cut greenhouse gas externalities in Chicago by 50-60%. Solely targeting reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, however, comes at the cost of increases in traffic externalities such as congestion",2023,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,8318821 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 8318821 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science; 99999 Engineering not elsewhere classified; FOS: Other engineering and technologies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through a social constructivist worldview (Creswell, 2007) this case study uses a grounded multilevel mixed methods (Borner, et al., 2010) approach to determine social mechanisms of cross-disciplinary teams (CDTs) observing a National Institutes of Health-funded research network. Observations, interviews, focus groups and through the use of the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI) (Cameron and Quinn, 2006) data were collected and analyzed using qualitative coding to inform a micro/meso level of analysis between February 2010 and December 2011. Aim 1 sets out to determine social structuring mechanisms in CDTs. It searched for the dynamics that are at the core of team collaboration by focusing on descriptive elements found in team interactions on the individual, group, and network levels (Hedström & Swedberg, 1998). Aim 2 determines how social mechanisms emerge in a transdisciplinary team. As transdisciplinarity (TD) is an unlikely constant state in social systems, it may at times be a novel outcome of team science collaborations. At other times it may be dormant to lesser multi- and interdisciplinary functions embedded within group interactions (Klein, 2008). Through theoretical and emergent coding and graphical mapping of present and preferred change perceptions of those charged with crossing disciplinary and social boundaries the answer to how these mechanism emerge has been achieved. Findings show strong evidence of role and discipline perceptual differences that when analyzed separately provide differing insights into team functioning. When role and discipline were considered simultaneously, certain value-latent characteristics emerged as part of individual's self-perception of one's contribution to team functioning. Four main social mechanisms were identified: change, kinship, tension, and heritage. These contain identifiable team dynamics that serve as core evidence for specific team dynamics that support CDTs. This micro/meso analysis suggests that individual participation in team interactions can inform the structuration of individual role and disciplinary perceptions of macro level problems.",2012,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,Social Mechanisms of Team Science,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Social Mechanisms of Team Science: A Descriptive Case Study Using a Multilevel Systems Perspective Employing Reciprocating Structuration Theory ISBN: 9781267258205 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 7 Volume: 73,,,,,Boundaries; Cooperation; Kinship; Medical sciences; Participation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The monetization of QoS of data can be managed by traffic management and performance optimization policies. This traffic prioritization can be application specific as well as application agnostic, but essentially based on user choice and in compliance with Net Neutrality principles. The mobile operators' quest to evolve from their ""dumb bit pipe"" role to become more involved in shaping the user experience through collaborative innovation with application developers and content providers is the main driver behind this concept. Three case studies, have been evaluated in this thesis, namely 1) zero.facebook.com, where Facebook collaborates with mobile operators across the world to bundle a stripped down Facebook application version with a mobile connection, 2) collaboration between Google Voice and Sprint where Sprint is adding Over The Top Google Voice minutes to its mobile plans, and 3) NTT DoCoMo's i-mode, which served as a revolutionary concept in the mobile services, as a traditional mobile operator reshaped the consumer experience through customized service offerings and by getting involved in almost all sectors of the telecommunication value chain. The common parameters identified in these case studies, combined with the findings of interviews with over fifty stakeholders across the telecommunications value chain, have been brought together in the aggregated model presented in this thesis; ""collaborative innovation"" and ""user experience control"" are identified as two significant factors driving the rationale behind monetization of QoS of mobile data.

To that end, there are over thirty countries around the world pursuing their first commercial nuclear power plants, and almost all will import their first reactors. The U.S. nuclear industry simply cannot compete with countries like Russia and China when it comes to exporting large light-water reactor (LWR) projects. Yet there is a boom of companies working on advanced nuclear technologies in the U.S., many aiming to be cost-competitive with fossil fuels. Someof these designs, particularly microreactors less than 10MW, could be demonstrated on much shorter timelines and at much lower costs than previously assumed, proving the technology domestically while also validating a potential export product. This thesis will investigate the nexus between these two emergent trends in the global nuclear industry: a shift away from the US as the dominant exporter and the implications for international security, andthe move toward smaller, factory-produced commercial nuclear reactors. In Chapter 2, I explore the role that nuclear exports have played historically in strengthening international nuclear material control regimes, and the implications of a decline in U.S. exports. I present results from a participatory expert workshop that evaluated policies that might be adopted to regain U.S. influence, including expanded U.S. exports of new nuclear technologies. However, the results from the workshop indicated that diplomatic strategies would be more feasible to implement over strategies that relied on a revitalized U.S. nuclearexport market. The experts concluded that advanced reactor technologies would not be commercially viable on relevant timescale. Yet recent policy and commercial developmentsuggest that microreactors could be commercialized on much shorter timelines. To understand the potential of these microreactors, in Chapter 3, I perform a technoeconomicevaluation of small-scale nuclear off-grid and community microgrid applications. I develop case studies for potential niche markets for the technology: two off-grid dieselivpowered Canadian communities, a large hospital in Alaska, and a college campus in Wisconsin. The results indicate that microreactors can be cheaper and more reliable comparedto 100% renewables systems, and they can also be cost-competitive with diesel where fuel costs are greater than $1/liter and the microreactor capital cost is less than $15,000/kW. However, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for microreactors is most sensitive to theinitial capital cost, and whether this technology will ever move beyond niche markets will depend on the learning effects accrued through factory fabrication. Thus, in Chapter 4 I will examine the hypothetical trade-offs between economies of scale and economies of volume for potential factory-fabricated microreactors. I calculate the break-even volumes necessary for microreactors to become cost-competitive with large reactors and with fossil fuels, using parameters from historic nuclear builds and analogousenergy technologies. Drawing from the literature on learning rates across energy technologies, I predict potential learning rates for various sized microreactors based on historical relations. Finally, I will outline some of the policy challenges of this new nuclear paradigm, along with areas for future study regarding the near-term deployment of microreactors.",12/17/20,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/13407836.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/V89WULM2/Lovering - 2020 - Evaluating Changing Paradigms Across the Nuclear Industry.pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2UDBH7GC,thesis,2009,"Castillo, Andrea R.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Assessing computational methods and science policy in systems biology,,,,,,"In this thesis, I discuss the development of systems biology and issues in the progression of this science discipline. Traditional molecular biology has been driven by reductionism with the belief that breaking down a biological system into the fundamental biomolecular components will elucidate such phenomena. We have reached limitations with this approach due to the complex and dynamical nature of life and our inability to intuit biological behavior from a modular perspective [37]. Mathematical modeling has been integral to current system biology endeavors since detailed analysis would be invasive if performed on humans experimentally or in clinical trials [17]. The interspecies commonalities in systemic properties and molecular mechanisms suggests that certain behaviors transcend specie differentiation and therefore easily lend to generalizing from simpler organisms to more complex organisms such as humans [7, 17]. Current methodologies in mathematical modeling and analysis have been diverse and numerous, with no standardization to progress the discipline in a collaborative manner. Without collaboration during this formative period, successful development and application of systems biology for societal welfare may be at risk. Furthermore, such collaboration has to be standardized in a fundamental approach to discover generic principles, in the manner of preceding long-standing science disciplines. This study effectively implements and analyzes a mathematical model of a three-protein biochemical network, the Synechococcus elongatus circadian clock., (cont.) I use mass action theory expressed in kronecker products to exploit the ability to apply numerical methods-including sensitivity analysis via boundary value formulation (BVP) and trapiezoidal integration rule-and experimental techniques-including partial reaction fitting and enzyme-driven activations-when mathematically modeling large-scale biochemical networks. Amidst other applicable methodologies, my approach is grounded in the law of mass action because it is based in experimental data and biomolecular mechanistic properties, yet provides predictive power in the complete delineation of the biological system dynamics for all future time points. The results of my research demonstrate the holistic approach that mass action method-ologies have in determining emergent properties of biological systems. I further stress the necessity to enforce collaboration and standardization in future policymaking, with reconsiderations on current stakeholder incentive to redirect academia and industry focus from new molecular entities to interests in holistic understanding of the complexities and dynamics of life entities.

In addition to analyzing historic epidemic data, computational simulation of epidemic propagation processes and disease control strategies can help us understand in the laboratory the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics. Consequently, the public can be better prepared and the government can control future epidemic outbreaks more effectively. Epidemic propagation simulation systems which use high performance computing technology have been proposed and developed to understand disease propagation processes. The proposed systems, however, do not strongly support two important steps in modeling disease propagation: run-time infection situation assessment and intervention adjustment. In addition, while these simulation systems are computationally efficient in their simulations, most of them have limited capabilities in terms of modeling interventions in realistic scenarios. In this dissertation, we focus on building a modeling and simulation environment for epidemic propagation and propagation control strategy. The objective of this work is to design such a modeling environment supporting the previously missing functions while still performing well in terms of the expected features such as modeling fidelity, computational efficiency, modeling capability, etc. Our proposed methodologies to build such a modeling environment are: 1) a loosely coupled and co-evolving model for disease propagation, situation assessment, and propagation control strategy, and 2) using relational databases to assess situations and simulate control strategies. Our motivations are: 1) a loosely coupled and co-evolving model allows us to design modules for each function separately and reduces design complexity for the modeling system, and 2) simulating propagation control strategies using relational databases improves the modeling capability and the human productivity of using this environment. To evaluate our proposed methodologies, we have designed and built a loosely coupled and database supported epidemic modeling and simulation environment. With detailed experimental results and realistic case studies, we demonstrate that our modeling environment provides the missing functions and greatly enhances many expected features, such as modeling capability, without significantly sacrificing computational efficiency and scalability.",2013,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: A Database Supported Modeling Environment for Pandemic Planning and Course of Action Analysis ISBN: 9781303788000,,,,,Computer science; Operations research; Public health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2YEF8GJ9,thesis,2021,"Qiu, Minghao; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems","Impacts of energy and environmental policies on air quality: bridging observational data, statistical, and atmospheric models",,,,,,"As more countries have adopted regulations on ambient air pollution and announced commitments moving away from fossil fuel energy, assessing the impacts of adopted energy and environmental policies on air quality is essential to evaluating policy progress and informing future actions. The increasing amount of measurement data on pollutant concentrations and precursor emissions provides an opportunity for tracking the progress of policies in mitigating air pollution, but key challenges remain. Levels of measured air pollutants and its precursor emissions are subject to variability in both the natural environment and human activities. This thesis incorporates four studies that integrate research tools across disciplines - from statistical causal inference to atmospheric chemistry models - to assess the impacts of adopted energy and environmental policy on air quality, in support of decision making in energy, climate, and environmental governance., The first study estimates the impacts of energy policies on air quality in major energy-intensive industrial sectors in China with both prospective and retrospective methods. It finds that the realized effects of policy on energy and pollution outcomes are generally much smaller than the projected benefits. The differences between projected and realized benefits stem from how policy baselines are selected and reflect heterogeneity in firms' policy responses., The second study evaluates the impacts of wind power development on air quality and related environmental justice issues in the US. We find substantial air quality benefits from existing wind power, but benefits would increase four-fold if policies could prioritize displacing the most damaging units. The fraction of air quality benefits accruing to low income and minority populations fall below a new 40% goal for future US policies, suggesting targeted efforts are needed to address air pollution disparities., The third study designs a statistical method to estimate the average emission factors of vehicles (the relevant outcome for decision making) based on snapshot measurements (the quantity being measured in the field). We find that a much lower fraction of the measured fleet in Europe is in compliance with emission standards compared to previous estimates. We further quantify the uncertainty and effectiveness of detecting high-emitting vehicles with snapshot measurements., The fourth study evaluates the ability of statistical methods to attribute observed pollutant trends to emissions changes under meteorological variability. We show that widely-used regression methods do not perform well, and we propose a machine learning model that offers better performance. We further provide a lower bound of the estimation error due to interactions between meteorology and emissions.",2021,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,Impacts of energy and environmental policies on air quality,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Impacts of energy and environmental policies on air quality : bridging observational data, statistical, and atmospheric models",,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the worldwide prevalence of these policies, little research has been conducted on ex-ante RET policy analysis. In an effort to move toward evidence-based policymaking, this thesis develops computational models to assess the tradeoffs associated with alternatives for both RET achievement and RET policy formulation, including the option of creating renewable energy credit (REC) markets to facilitate meeting an RET goal. A mixed integer linear program (MILP), a probabilistic cost prediction model and a mixed complementarity problem (MCP) serve as the theoretical bases for the RET alternative and policy formulation analyses. From these models it was found, inter alia, that RET goals set too low run the risk of creating technological lock-in and could inhibit achievement of higher goals; probabilistic cost predictions give decision-makers essential risk information, when cost estimation is an integral part of alternatives assessment; and though REC markets may facilitate RET achievement, including REC markets in an RET policy formulation may not result in the lowest possible greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).",5/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715268.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of the ecological changes that threaten the long-term survival of humans and of other species have anthropogenic origins. Industry’s impact and its role in mitigating these impacts is the focus of much discussion and debate. Two industries that are working to deal with these issues are the printing and paper industries. The environmental impacts associated with the entire life-cycle of paper are significant, yet the socially redeeming value of the content printed can be equally as significant. A curious paradox is that advances in information and communication technology (ICT) have long been predicted to lead to a reduction in media use, resulting in the so-called paperless office, but this has not been the case. Until recently, the observed trends worldwide demonstrate that in most countries paper consumption has been on the rise, however in some developed countries there is some suggestion that this trend may be reversing. The work of Sellen and Harper (2002) provides a qualitative explanation of why paper consumption is on the rise. Nonetheless, there is little research that develops quantitative models to explain paper consumption patterns. This thesis leverages Sellen and Harper’s qualitative models to develop a system dynamics model to explain the effects and interactions between ICT, the affordances of paper and paper-like technologies, and knowledge work flows. Specifically, the Bass Diffusion technology adoption model and the path dependence patterns of behavior are modified in an attempt to reproduce the paper consumption patterns observed in the United States (US). Sensitivity analysis through the use of a fractional factorial experiment has been performed to identify the most influential model parameters to set the model parameters at values that best represent US data. An assessment of the system dynamic model’s utility based on a publically available quantitative study of the amount of original information that is produced and stored each year is also presented in this study. The thesis will close with recommendations to improve the model and for future research work.",2010,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Print media paper consumption patterns through a system dynamics approach ISBN: 9781124177472,,,,,Industrial engineering; Mass media; Telecommunication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wind and solar energy are non-dispatchable: their energy output is uncertain and variable from hour-to- hour. New challenges arise in electricity markets with a large share of uncertain and variable renewable energy. We investigate some of these challenges and identify economic opportunities and policy changes to mitigate them. We study electricity markets by focusing on the preferences and strategic behavior of three different groups: producers, consumers, and load-serving entities. First, we develop a game-theoretic model to investigate energy producer strategy in electricity markets with high levels of uncertain renewable energy. We show that increased geographic dispersion of renewable generators can reduce market power and increase social welfare. We also demonstrate that high-quality public forecasting of energy production can increase welfare. Second, we model and explain the effects of retail electricity competition on producer market power and forward contracting. We show that increased retail competition could decrease forward contracting and increase electricity prices; this is a downside to the general trend of increased access to retail electricity competition. Finally, we propose new methods for improving demand response programs. A demand response program operator commonly sets customer baseline thresholds to determine compensation for individual customers. The optimal way to do this remains an open question. We create a new model that casts the demand response program as a sequential decision problem; this formulation highlights the importance of learning about individual customers over time.

The planned changes will include deployment of new commercial-off-the-shelf financial management software, and simultaneous changes to USCG organizational structures and FM processes. Proposed changes to the USCG FM system are intended to bring the Service into compliance with Federal standards for financial operations, while simultaneously improving delivery of financial business support to end users. This thesis applies Dr. Nancy Leveson's System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) safety methodology to perform a hazard analysis on aspects of the re-engineered (future state) business processes to help ensure the system can deliver its intended performance. Application of STPA on the USCG FM system was conducted with the aid of the Safety Hazard Analysis Tool (SafetyHAT) software released in March 2014 by the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center. SafetyHAT is intended to aid users in performing hazard analysis using STPA. The use of SafetyHAT for this thesis research is its first application outside of the Volpe Center and transportation domain. Recommendations for tailoring the tool to the financial management and other domains are proposed. The application of STPA on targeted aspects of the USCG FM system identified 205 causal factors for potential system hazards. Recommendations to appropriately remediate the causal factors are proposed based on systems theory principles and tools. Recommended improvements include robust feedback and communication channels illustrated using the system control diagram used to perform STPA. System dynamics modeling is also used to quantitatively illustrate the non-linear interactions that exist in the USCG FM system, and how the system design will affect its performance over time. The simulations show that if the causal factors identified using STPA are not addressed, the FM system may fail to achieve its intended performance. Other recommendations include the expanded use of system dynamic modeling to inform future design decisions for the USCG FM system, including trade-offs driven by resource limitations, as the re-engineering effort progresses.",2014,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,U.S. Coast Guard financial management,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, System Design and Management Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis SD&M 2014 S.M.,Book Title: U.S. Coast Guard financial management : a systems approach to business process reengineering,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; System Design and Management Program; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Boundary organizations and boundary chains have been promoted as ways to help mitigate the problematic effects these divisions have on the successful communication of climate adaptation information in the water management sector. In this dissertation, I present three studies that were conducted in two regions to further explore stakeholder groups and the boundary chains that connect them. Both areas (Guanacaste, Costa Rica and Montana, USA) are historically agricultural regions experiencing ongoing environmental and socio-economic shifts. A mental models approach involving the use of interviews and surveys was used in each study area. The first two studies were conducted in Guanacaste and focused on comparing stakeholder group perceptions of their water system and hydro-climate information and on the differences in trust in forecast sources and its impact on forecast use. The results of these studies suggest that there is a distinction between the perceptions of larger stakeholder groups (e.g. government agencies or large farmers) and smaller groups (e.g. local water committees), and that this division suggests a need for boundary-type translation work. The third study was conducted in Montana with a focus on what communication strategies are used by, and what prompts engagement with, a boundary chain connecting rural agriculturalists to urban scientists. The results show that members of the network generally agree that for successful communication it is important both to not engage in ways viewed as attacks on agriculture and to make attempts to understand and respect local agricultural contexts. While there is some tension in the network, overall “buy-in” to the goal of bridging divides appears to be a common reason for engagement. In addition, organizations engage with the boundary chain for both the opportunity to connect to others and because of the need for translation between the concerns and logistics of different groups.",5/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716576.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have hope. I have told Malawians that we need to look into the future with hope and I know that we shall be fine. What I am implying here is that ultimately what is going to save democracy in Malawi is the willingness by Malawians to protect themselves and preserve the freedoms and rights which they have…, (President, Joyce Banda, 2011). The thesis of this study is that the Malawi Parliament ought to be the hub of vertical and horizontal accountability in legislation, representation and oversight roles. Salih, (2005, p.3) states that parliaments are caught between fulfilling the governance role and acting as part of government. Therefore, in order to effectively fulfil this objective, parliament must be supported, (Ma Ngok, in Siu-Kai, 2002). However, the study notes that the Malawi Parliament has a high executive influence; no policy making power with minimal legislative viscosity, (Norton, 2005, 1990; Polsby, 1975; Mezey, 1979 and Blondel, 1973). Consequently, it is argued with empirical data that since the 1994 multiparty election, parliament has not been effective in its vertical and horizontal accountability roles, (Lindberg, 2009). In the horizontal accountability, parliament plays an inter-governmental role of the executive oversight as well as that of checks and balance, (Stapenhurst and O’Brien, 2011, p. 3). In the vertical, parliament is held accountable through its elected members by its voters, stakeholders and the civil society, (Chirwa and Nijzink, 2012, p.6). It is argued that when voters (principals) delegate their decision-making power to parliament (agent), the principal must have mechanisms in place of holding the agent(s) accountable for their actions or lack of it and if necessary, impose sanctions or remove the agent from power, (Strom, 1999, pp. 7, 8). In every developed democracy, government policies and services are demand driven; sanctioned, monitored and evaluated by the legislature (Lupia and McCubbins, 1999, p. 4). Using empirical data, the study observed that although the Malawi Parliament has made significant reforms towards regaining its independence and autonomy from the executive, it still continues to be seen as a legitimatisation and sometimes rubberstamping institution, (Nyamongo, 2010; Chinsinga, 2007; Patel, 2007). The contributory factors were both intrinsic and extrinsic such as lack of institutional capacity as well as political will by the executive to support a greater parliamentary autonomy. Thus, the study recommends that the Malawi Parliament institutes a human resource development programme in order to improve the technical capacity of legislative support staff as well as MPs; increase funding and strengthen parliamentary committee system for higher scrutiny as well as a wider stakeholder consultation at every stage of the legislative process; The study also recommends that appointments of directors in auxiliary governance agencies such as the Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Electoral Commission of Malawi, and the Human Rights Commission shift from the presidency to parliament. It is the assumption of this study that increasing parliamentary oversight potential promotes democracy and good governance, (Pelizzo and Stapenhurst, 2007, p.13).",2015,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: The vertical and horizontal accountability in the malawi parliamentary democracy,,,,,Democracy; Liability (Law),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My research examined three potential environmental and health risks. (1) For the last half-century the Northeast natural gas market was supplied from major producing areas in Texas, the Gulf Coast, and Canada. Because radon has a short half-life of 3.8 days, the time required to transport the natural gas from these areas to the Northeast resulted in a low-radon product being delivered to homes. As the Northeast gas market transitions to locally-produced natural gas the potential for radioactive decay will diminish and the natural gas being delivered to homes will contain radon at higher levels. I assess the lung cancer risk for people living in homes with unvented gas cooking (approximately half of the homes in the Northeast) and heating appliances, which are in fewer homes. Data on the locally-produced natural gas radon concentration are limited, but for the modeling assumptions considered the radon exposure is predicted to be small compared to typical residential exposures, and additional annual population-level risk will likely be much less than the error in the estimate of annual radon-induced lung cancers. An excess lifetime lung cancer risk >10-4 is possible for high gas usage in poorly ventilated settings. (2) High volume and locally-concentrated surface water withdrawals for Marcellus Shale development may pose a risk to water quality, aquatic and riparian ecosystems, and other uses of water resources. State environmental and interstate water authorities take different approaches to managing these water withdrawals. In the Upper Ohio River Basin, which covers the western third of Pennsylvania, the Department of Environmental Protection requires that all water used for shale gas development be covered by a water management plan. These plans stipulate the amount and timing of surface water withdrawals from each source as a function of annual stream flow statistics. Neighboring regulatory authorities and some environmental groups favor the use of monthly flow statistics instead, but implementation of these statistics in western Pennsylvania would require more data than are currently available. Because hydrologic data in the Upper Ohio River Basin are sparse, the use of the annual flow statistics is more likely than use of monthly flow statistics to prevent water withdrawals when aquatic ecosystems are under the greatest stress. The annual flow statistic might also result in fewer and smaller occurrences of computed ecodeficits under scenarios of development-related water demands in the future. (3) Improperly abandoned and orphan gas wells threaten human health and safety as well as pollute the air and water. Pennsylvania currently requires production companies to post a bond to ensure environmental reclamation of non-productive well sites, but the cost of plugging horizontally drilled wells and reclaiming well pads is estimated to be at least a factor of 10 greater than the current well bonds. The economics of shale gas development favor transfer of assets from large entities to smaller ones. With the assets go the liabilities, and without a mechanism to prevent the new owners from assuming reclamation liabilities beyond their means, the economics favor default on well-plugging and site restoration obligations. In addition to increasing the bond amounts, individual well trust accounts are proposed based on a model from the coal industry. Pre- and delayed-funding options (a fee and severance tax, respectively) to pay for future reclamation are examined from the perspective of the taxpayer. The exposure of the taxpayer to these financial liabilities and to a future orphan well problem can be minimized with minimal impacts to the profitability of gas production regardless of which funding option is used.",12/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:23,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714752.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/WKQUFB6J/Mitchell - 2013 - Analysis of health and environmental risks associated with Marcellus Shale development.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37HU5D3H,thesis,2016,"Braganza, Soumya; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Point-of-use soil diagnostics: an actionable information system for resource constrained farmers,,,,,,"During the mid-1960s, India came to the brink of an acute food crisis in the midst of heavy dependence on food imports. A period of rapid agricultural modernization that followed, known as Green Revolution, transformed India from a net importer of food into an exporter. Although an appropriate response for abating the impending starvation, the Green Revolution inflicted several unintended consequences. For example, regulatory structure and fertilizer subsidies for urea that were designed to stimulate growth instead resulted in a lock-in, which in turn incentivized vast over-fertilization across the country. Today, this is a well-recognized problem, and the Government of India has announced policies and schemes such as the National Soil Health Card Scheme to increase knowledge of soil condition and curb fertilizer use. In reality, however, the current need for information on soil health far exceeds the capacity for soil testing, highlighting the need for a radical approach to meeting this policy objective. This project, undertaken in collaboration with MIT Mechanical Engineering, takes a two-part approach to addressing this problem, with the design of a point-of-use soil testing sensor and an accompanying recommendation generation engine. This thesis presents the design of the latter based upon the answer to the following question: what constitutes an actionable information for resource constrained farmers? To answer it, we use a mixed methodology approach comprising (i) a combination of stakeholder interviews and design workshops to elicit user needs, and (ii) controlled experimentation with over 200 farmers covering an entire village to measure the actionability of information in soil health recommendations. The results of the analysis of experimental data reveal that the actionability of recommendations varies significantly within the population of farmers tested, and can be attributed to the level of information provided, the environment in which a farmer receives a recommendation, gender, and education level. Consequently, an effective point-of-use diagnostic system must adjust for these factors in order to maintain high actionability. To that end, we then use the experimental results to design a recommendation generation engine, the core of which is a soil health database that maximizes the actionability of information for a resource constrained farmer.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,Point-of-use soil diagnostics,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Point-of-use soil diagnostics : an actionable information system for resource constrained farmers,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the interconnectedness of these systems there is a lack of empirical research documenting how these organizations work collectively - or integrate - and how this integration impacts enterprise performance measured through quality, efficiency, and access. In the case of psychological healthcare, patients often require a number of services that span multiple departments and programs within an enterprise, increasing the complexity of maintaining a continuum of care for these patients. This paper, which is part of a larger effort to examine psychological healthcare in the U.S. Military Health System, presents a series of qualitative observations and analyses of the integration of psychological health-related organizations at two large health enterprises within the military. These qualitative inquiries take a multilevel approach for examining integration within these enterprises and address the following areas of interest: 1) the mechanisms for integration; 2) the objects of integration; 3) the dimensions of integration; 4) the contextual factors that influence integration; and 5) the impacts of integration on enterprise performance. Using semi-structured interviews, qualitative data was collected and then examined using content analysis to identify the most frequent themes for each area of interest. This data was used to validate and refine a comprehensive framework for integration that was developed to pull together multiple, distinct strands of the integration literature. This data was also used to demonstrate the relationship between different dimensions of enterprise performance and to identify areas where, in the process of optimizing enterprise performance, there is a trade-off between these dimensions. The preliminary, qualitative results of this research are intended to provide a conceptual foundation and framework for future analytic studies.",2012,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,Integration and the performance of large-scale health enterprises,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2012 S.M.,Book Title: Integration and the performance of large-scale health enterprises : field studies of psychological health delivery systems in the U.S. Military,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior work typically restricts preference heterogeneity analysis to differences in preference content.

We present a general framework for analyzing and discoveringpreference content and structure from choice data. Our framework extends welfare measurementto fully account for preference heterogeneity and can help to better understand the welfare impacts of new policies for sub-populations. As heterogeneity in preference canbe related to judgment structure, we first study how heterogeneity in preference content is related to heuristic judgment. We establish the relationship between judgment and choice for cumulative flood risks. Second, we propose a model that can directly determine differencesin both preference content and structure for individual decision makers empirically using graph matching methods. Finally, we measure heterogeneity in preference content across sub-populations. We develop and test a method to uncover relevant sub-populations in a choice model automatically using machine learning tools. We illustrate the approach discovering relevant socioeconomic covariates in a recent and real decision facing the Chilean government about the environmental impacts of electricity generation.

3BQ7GBJH,thesis,2015,"Stein, Beth R.",Applications of Imaging Spectroscopy in Forest Ecosystems at Multiple Scales,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1991483318?pq-origsite=primo,"Forests provide a number of ecosystem services which sustain and enrich the wildlife, human societies, and the environment. However, many disturbances threaten forest ecosystems, making it necessary to monitor their health for optimal management and conservation. Although there are many indicators of forest health, changes in biogeochemical cycling, loss of species diversity, and invasive plants are particularly useful due to their vulnerability to the effects of climate change and intensive agricultural land use. Thus, this work evaluates the use of imaging spectroscopy to monitor forest nutrient status, species diversity, and plant invasions in the Mid- Atlantic region. The research is divided into four separate studies, each of which evaluated a unique application for imaging spectroscopy data at a different scale within the forest. The first two studies examined loblolly pine nutrient status at the leaf and canopy scales, respectively. The first study determined that loblolly pine foliar macronutrient concentrations can be successfully modeled across the Southeastern US (R2=0.39-0.74). Following on these results, the second study focused on the relationship between physical characteristics, reflectance, and nutrients. Reflectance values and W scattering coefficients produced successful nitrogen models across loblolly pine plots at the canopy scale. Regression models showed similar explanatory power for nitrogen, although W scattering coefficients were significantly correlated with nitrogen at multiple wavelengths and reflectance variables were not. However, the direction of some of the correlations with W and the unusually high directional area scattering factor values indicate a need for further experimentation. The third study found that several imaging spectroscopy algorithms were moderately successful in identifying wavyleaf basketgrass invasions in mixed deciduous forests (overall accuracy=0.35-0.78; kappa=0.41-0.53). Lastly, the fourth study used a novel imaging spectroscopy/lidar fusion to identify canopy gaps and measure species diversity of understory vegetation. The lidar algorithm identified 29 of 34 canopy gaps, and regression models explained 49 percent of the variance in gap species diversity. In conclusion, imaging spectroscopy can be used to evaluate ecosystem health through forest nutrient status, nitrogen models, species diversity estimates, and identification of invasive plant species.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Applications of Imaging Spectroscopy in Forest Ecosystems at Multiple Scales ISBN: 9780355348187,,,,,Remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation examines how DER benefit different stakeholders in the electric power sector: DER owners, ratepayers, utilities, and society. In Chapter 2, we investigate how increasing commercial CHP system peak penetrations may affect net emissions, the distribution network, and total system energy costs. We find that small commercial CHP, due to low and inconsistent heat loads, can increase emissions relative to the bulk grid. We suggest policy options to encourage CHP operation during times of high heat loads. In Chapter 3, we develop metrics based on existing best utility practices that characterize how much solar can reduce peak demand on distribution network feeders. We conclude that solar can act as a capacity resource, but the size of the resource depends on the geographic region. Energy storage or an allowance for occasional overloading within a transformer’s tolerance can increase the capacity resource of solar. Chapter 4 is a value of solar and rate impact study for the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC). The Pennsylvania PUC can use it to decide whether the environmental benefits of solar are worth the relatively small rate impact caused by rooftop solar. In Chapter 5, we assess the ability of rooftop solar and storage to reduce peak loads and defer distribution capacity projects in the PECO service territory. We find that targeted placement of solar can increase the total deferral value up to fourfold, but capacity deferral opportunities are rare and large administrative efforts to manage deferral projects, such as markets, are probably not warranted.",3/6/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7808372.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/86ARTD5U/Keen - 2019 - Stakeholder Costs and Benefits of Distributed Energy Resources on Distribution Networks.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it can be challenging to ensure safety without the support of appropriate techniques and tools for hazard analysis and requirement engineering. Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a hazard analysis technique that has been developed at MIT. It is based on systems and control theory and aims at capturing more causal factors leading to accidents, including component interactions. So far, STPA has been successfully applied to various industries. While there are tools that allow engineers to document the results of hazard analysis based on STPA, there are no tools that provide guidance during the analysis. Also, although a method is proposed to generate requirements from an STPA analysis, no tools have been developed to support that process. This thesis illustrates how tools can provide support for hazard analysis and requirement generation based on STPA, based on the proof of concept of a software tool that was developed at MIT. This STPA tool assists STPA Step I analysis by applying logical simplification to the original Step I results and automatically generating the simplified requirement in formal and executable forms. The simplified requirements are easily understandable and address all of the unsafe control actions identified in the original STPA analysis. The use of the STPA tool is illustrated through a case study of automotive systems that include multiple features. The STPA tool generates simplified and formal requirements for each individual feature based on STPA Step I results. In addition, it is also used to check whether conflicts between features have been resolved and to identify exactly what decisions should be made jointly between multiple design teams.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Tool-assisted hazard analysis and requirement generation based on STPA,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3RVLLIIT,thesis,2014,"Liu, Tingyu; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Multi-stakeholder collaborations & biomarker development and implementation,,,,,,"The rise of genomic technologies and increasing interest in personalized medicine have triggered a renewed focus on the role of biomarkers in drug development and clinical care. While many stakeholders, including industry, regulatory agencies, patients, academia, and payers, are involved in biomarker development and use, these stakeholders reside in functional siloes that lead to fragmented outputs and efforts. Thus, although biomarker discovery is extensive, biomarker adoption in the R&D process and clinical care is slow, complex, and opaque. The gap between discovery and practice needs to be bridged by clear and consistent evidentiary standards, regulations and policies. Biomarker adoption requires a systems effort that includes active dialogue and understanding among all stakeholders. The level of discussions and resources (data, samples, expertise, financial, etc.) needed also makes this field particularly fertile for collaboration. This thesis suggests that multi-stakeholder collaborations (MSCs) can address the challenges of biomarker adoption. It describes what has been achieved in existing prominent MSCs, extracts general lessons on their contributions, and provides recommendations on the use of MSCs in drug development. Specifically, MSCs have demonstrated impact across 4 key areas: 1) data generation and establishment of standards; 2) development of scientific processes for biomarker evaluation and use; 3) the structuring of innovative operational and organizational scaffolds for collaboration; and 4) delivery of vetted regulatory recommendations and robust biomarkers for use by drug developers and clinicians. Understanding the roles, evolution, and challenges of MSCs will be important in enhancing the capacity to collaborate to address the complex challenges for biomedical innovation and healthcare outcomes.",2014,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Multi-stakeholder collaborations & biomarker development and implementation,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Venting and flaring of associated natural gas represents significant environmental and financial losses yet it continues in the North Dakota Bakken oil play. The valuable gas resource is wasted due to unfavorable economics and limited pipeline capacity. Similarly in India, underdeveloped gas transport infrastructure and restrictive regulatory frameworks prevent distribution and marketing of natural gas from the northeast regions, leaving it stranded in marginal fields. This thesis establishes a techno-economic model, utilizing Aspen Plus chemical processing software, and a discounted cash flow model to estimate economic feasibility of implementing MIT engine reformer-based gas-to-liquids (GTL) systems in the US or India. The system reforms natural gas via partial oxidation into synthesis gas (syngas) in the cylinders of an internal combustion engine, and can significantly reduce capital costs over conventional GTL reforming processes. The engine is operated in fuel rich conditions to generate the syngas, which is synthesized into methanol and dimethyl ether (DME). Once produced on-site, these liquids are more easily transported than gases. This study assesses the regulatory structures surrounding the upstream methane resource and downstream end product marketability for three scenarios: use of DME to replace existing local (1) diesel and (2) liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or (3) sale of methanol as a commodity chemical on domestic or global markets. The analysis shows the system is economical in both locations. In the US, the minimum economically efficient production capacity with a 1-2 year payback period is 400,000- 860,000 standard cubic feet per day (scfpd) of natural gas for the range of end use scenarios considered. Differences in costs and product market characteristics in India result in a minimum efficient capacity of 330,000-810,000 scfpd of natural gas for the three scenarios.",2015,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: System model of small-scale gas-to-methanol conversion by engine reformers,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3SPYEPX5,thesis,2010,"Morisset, Thomas; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Comparing capacities and delays at major European and American airports,,,,,,"Successful air transport systems must satisfy the demand for flights while maintaining a high level of service and safety. For airports, which have limited capacities, policy-makers must compromise between maximizing the number of flights served and avoiding excessive delays. Differences between policies adopted in the US and in Europe result in distinct airport performances, the analysis of which reveals best practices. The first point of comparison is over the capacities of a set of the busiest airports in the US and Europe. Under radar-based air traffic control procedures, Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), American airports achieve equal or higher capacities than European airports with similar runway layouts. These discrepancies cannot be explained by the differences in separation requirements alone. Besides, through their extensive use of Visual Flight Rules (VFR), weather permitting, American airports gain an important premium on their capacities. US air traffic control practices and policies clearly result in a more efficient use of airport infrastructure. Second, arrival delays relative to schedule increase over the course of the day at the US airports, while they remain mostly constant in Europe. Similarly the distributions of these delays show that schedule reliability at airports is significantly better in Europe than in the US. These comparisons underscore the benefits of Europe's policy of airport slot-controls, which cap the number of aircraft movements at a declared capacity. Moreover, arrival delays in the US are much higher under IFR (23 minutes average) than VFR (9 minutes). This shows that the high variability of the capacity of US airports depending on weather conditions, coupled with the tendency toward over-scheduling of flights, is damaging to the national airport system's stability and reliability. From these comparisons stem a few policy recommendations. Airline schedule reliability might benefit from additional controls or economic incentives to rationalize the scheduling of aircraft movements at some US airports. At the same time, some European airports could benefit from increasing their declared capacities. More generally, European aviation authorities should consider relaxing air traffic control separation procedures along the lines of US practices.",2010,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: Comparing capacities and delays at major European and American airports,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation conducts four categories of analysis on how electricity market design can be modernized to increase efficiency and avert roadblocks to economy-wide deep decarbonization. First, electric utilities can capture most of the system benefit of customer-sited energy storage resource (ESR) adoption with critical peak pricing (CPP). CPP is proposed as a simple and Pareto-improving rate design for commercial and industrial customers with ESRs, similar to time-of-use rates for electric vehicle owners. Second, previous research quantifying correlated generator failures in the PJM Interconnection canbe incorporated in both resource adequacy and scarcity pricing using an operating reserve demand curve (ORDC). Because correlated failures occur at very high and low temperatures when electricity demand is highest, there are substantial effects on target winter and summer planning reserve margins and increased social welfare from better accounting for generator failure probability when designing ORDCs. Third, as electricity markets evolve toward higher shares of variable, low marginal cost resources with ESRs new rules are needed to ensure resources’ full, competitive participation. A bi-level model implemented on a realistic, high renewables nodal test system highlights strategiesESRs and hybrids can use to raise prices, particularly cross-product and decongestion strategies, and suggests offer uniformity over co-optimized temporal intervals as a remedy. Fourth, metrics like effective load carrying capability (ELCC) are increasingly common for quantifying the system dependent contribution of variable generation and ESRs to resource adequacy. Extending these methods to a zonal evaluation of resource adequacy using data from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) shows transmission and ESRs have a complementarity benefit in zonal resource adequacy that is not realized by variable nor conventional generators, suggesting the importance of increased zonal representation in planning with ESRs.",2/18/22,5/20/25 15:38,5/20/25 15:38,5/20/25 15:38,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/19147811.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/YQCRSRBM/Lavin - 2022 - Data and technology-driven improvements to electricity market design.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Campbell; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Resource use in the Chinese building sector: foundations for analyzing urban transition,,,,,,"Around the world, people are moving to cities in order to become wealthy, especially in developing countries undergoing socio-economic transition. This will dramatically change the way that society consumes resources, in terms of both materials and energy. We will need to better understand how resource use changes as development happens in order to focus efforts to reduce that resource use. China is undergoing this transition as it enters the global stage, and with global implications for resource use. The building sector in China is especially resource-intensive, fundamentally driven by the country's urbanization, and plays a prominent role in the Chinese economy, making it a good candidate for the study of how systems adopt sustainable practices. I approach this problem in two ways. The first is quantitative, using k-means statistical clustering on longitudinal resource use data from Chinese statistical yearbooks, in order to identify and compare transitions across provinces in China. In comparing the evolution of the building sector across provinces, my analysis suggests that development pathways are more distinct than discrete development stages. I identify two development pathway 'types' in China. The first is an urban path taken by Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin -- the three most heavily urbanized provinces. All other provinces follow a general business-as-usual path, though I also identify sub-pathways to further differentiate between the other 27 provinces. These development typologies are one means of quantitatively operationalizing the abstract notion of transition. Identifying such pathways may highlight opportunities for learning between provinces within the same path, and one could apply similar methods to other scales of analysis (e.g. urban or national). My second approach is qualitative, driven by interviews conducted primarily in Beijing with various stakeholders in the Chinese building sector. In this analysis, I discuss the particularities of the actors and processes involved in Chinese real estate development, identify opportunities for and barriers to reduced life-cycle energy use in buildings, and describe three distinctive and ongoing sustainability experiments with the potential for significant resource use reductions. This research emphasizes the need for integrated approaches to both research and practice in approaching sustainability transitions, and provides a set of complementary frameworks for their analysis.",2014,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,Resource use in the Chinese building sector,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Resource use in the Chinese building sector : foundations for analyzing urban transition,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4893UMSN,thesis,2015,"Czaika, Ellen Gail; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Model use in sustainability negotiations and decisions,,,,,,"Sustainability negotiations and decisions require the integration of scientific information with stakeholder interests. Mathematical models help elucidate the physical world and therefore may orient the negotiators in a shared understanding of the physical world. Many researchers suggest collaborative modeling to facilitate integrating scientific information and stakeholder interests. In this thesis, I use methods that enable repeated instances of the same decision; the exploration of alternatives to model use (e.g. learning of a model's logic, relevant information, or irrelevant information); and the exploration of alternatives to collaborative modeling (e.g. using an expert model or not using a model). This thesis comprises two studies that use serious game role-play simulations. The first study is a computer-driven role-play simulation of governmental policy creation and the second is a five-party role-play simulation to negotiate a more sustainable end-of-life for used paper coffee cups. In the first study, model users reached the Pareto Frontier-the set of non-dominated points-more readily (13%) than non-model-users (2.5%) and model users discovered the win-win nature of electricity access with higher frequency (63%) than non-model users (9%). Participants who learned of the model's logic through presentation performed nearly as well as model users. In the second study, model use shortened the (mean) duration of the negotiation from 55 minutes to 45 minutes. Negotiating tables that co-created a model had a higher likelihood of reaching favorable agreements (44% compared to 25%). Model use did not significantly alter the value distribution among parties. Tables of negotiators used the model in two predominant manners: to test alternatives as they generated potential agreements and to verify a tentative agreement. The former resulted in higher mean table values than the latter. Together, these studies demonstrate: that mathematical models can be used in sustainability negotiations and decisions with good effect; that learning about the insights of a model is beneficial in decision making-but using a model is more beneficial; and that collaborative model building can provide better negotiation outcomes than using an expert model and can be faster than not using a model.",2015,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: Model use in sustainability negotiations and decisions,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49HASA9Q,thesis,2014,"Dwyer, Morgan Maeve; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",The cost of Jointness: insights from environmental monitoring systems in low Earth orbit,,,,,,"The term jointness refers to activities or operations that are executed collaboratively by more than one government agency or military department. While joint operations have become increasingly common and successful, the government continues to struggle with joint system acquisition: in fact, although a common motivation for joint acquisition is cost savings, recent studies suggest that joint programs experience larger cost growth than non-joint programs and that it may be more cost effective for agencies to acquire systems independently rather than jointly. This thesis explains why joint programs often experience large cost growth and how jointness itself may induce it. To understand the cost of jointness, this thesis proposes and demonstrates a new approach for studying large, complex acquisition programs whereby the evolution of a program's organizational and technical architectures is quantified and observed using a design structure matrix (DSM)-based tool. Using this approach, one is able to gain an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive a program's costs, as well as global perspective on cost growth throughout a program's lifecycle. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to study the cost impacts of jointness on three programs that developed environmental monitoring systems for low Earth orbit. The acquisition community's current understanding of joint programs suggests that jointness induces cost growth by increasing a program's organizational and technical complexity. However, using the DSM-based tool, this thesis demonstrates that complexity is a dynamic property of an acquisition program that is driven by government agencies' institutional interests and the actions that they motivate. Specifically, the thesis presents a more nuanced understanding of jointness, complexity, and cost growth by arguing that government agencies' institutional interest in retaining or regaining autonomy motivates actions that alter the agencies' relationships with one another, with the joint organization, and with the system under development. When agencies take action to retain or to regain autonomy, they increase the complexity of the joint organization or the joint system and the program's costs grow as result. Finally, the thesis discusses the implications of the proposed Agency Action Model both generally and specifically in the context of environmental monitoring programs. Aided by a trade space analysis tool that was developed to explore a broad set of concepts for future environmental monitoring systems, the thesis demonstrates how government leaders should approach the problem of joint program formulation and in doing so, generates a set a policy recommendations for future partnerships between the agencies that have historically collected environmental data from low Earth orbit.",2014,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,The cost of Jointness,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology, Management, and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: The cost of Jointness : insights from environmental monitoring systems in low Earth orbit,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This spending is highly sensitive to uncontrollable and poorly understood market forces. Additionally, while some stakeholders may not prioritize its monetary cost and risk, energy is fundamentally coupled to other critical factors. Energy, operational capability, and logistics are heavily intertwined and dependent on uncertain security environment and technology futures. These components and their relationships are less understood. Without better characterization, future capabilities may be significantly limited by present-day acquisition decisions. One attempt to demonstrate these costs and risks to decision makers has been through a metric known as the Fully Burdened Cost of Energy (FBCE). FBCE is defined as the commodity price for fuel plus many of these hidden costs. The metric encouraged a valuable conversation and is still required by law. However, most FBCE development stopped before the lessons from that conversation were incorporated. Current implementation is easy to employ but creates little value. Properly characterizing the costs and risks of energy and putting them in a useful tradespace requires a new framework. This research aims to highlight energy’s complex role in many aspects of military operations, the critical need to incorporate it in decisions, and a novel framework to do so. It is broken into five parts. The first describes the motivation behind FBCE, the limits of current implementation, and outlines a new framework that aids decisions. Respectively, the second, third, and fourth present a historic analysis of the connections between military capabilities and energy, analyze the recent evolution of this conversation within the DoD, and pull the historic analysis into a revised framework. The final part quantifies the potential impacts of deeply uncertain futures and technological development and introduces an expanded framework that brings capability, energy, and their uncertainty into the same tradespace. The work presented is intended to inform better policies and investment decisions for military acquisitions. The discussion highlights areas within the DoD’s understanding of energy that could improve or whose development has faltered.

However, there is significant uncertainty about how the technology will be accepted by the public, which is difficult to predict for relatively unknown technologies such as CCS. As such, this thesis explores the use of a similar but better known technology-hydraulic fracturing-as an analogue for learning lessons about public acceptance of the geologic storage component of CCS. The thesis asks two questions: (1) What factors are associated with public acceptance of geologic storage? And (2) What actions should communities, regulators, and stakeholders take to ensure the safe and efficient deployment of CCS technology? The thesis investigates these questions using three separate but related analyses. A series of regressions explores links between states' history of fossil fuel extraction and current regulatory attitudes toward hydraulic fracturing. A comparative case study characterizes trends in the development of laws and regulations related to hydraulic fracturing in three states: Pennsylvania, New York State, and Colorado. Finally, a survey identifies factors associated with positive and negative public perceptions of both hydraulic fracturing and CCS. The survey includes an experimental question that measures the extent to which compensation can be used to improve public acceptance for facility siting. Through these analyses, the thesis reaches several conclusions. States with an extensive history of fossil fuel extraction are more likely to regulate hydraulic fracturing with a moderate level of regulatory stringency, and similar tendencies toward CCS are likely. Municipalities are playing an increasingly significant role in the regulation of hydraulic fracturing, and are likely to be important stakeholders for CCS projects as well. A number of demographic and worldview factors are associated with public acceptance, but none were found to have substantial predictive power. However, the amount of compensation offered to nearby residents was found to have a moderate effect on public acceptance. Developers should therefore consider compensation a tool for increasing the likelihood of acceptance among residents nearby a potential project site. Policymakers should in turn institute market incentives such as robust carbon prices to foster a financial environment that encourages developers to engage with municipalities and residents.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Acceptance by proxy,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Acceptance by proxy : analyzing perceptions of hydraulic fracturing to better understand public acceptance for geologic storage of carbon dioxide,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

U.S. corn ethanol production keeps increasing under federal mandates, and NG production soars due to successful tapping of unconventional resources in North America, particularly shale gas. Numerous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies document technology specific corn ethanol and NG GHG estimates. The estimates often include all life cycle stages from fuel supply to combustion, and point out potential for emissions reductions. Several studies suggest that using GHG emissions as an evaluation metric underestimates corn ethanol’s radiative forcing (RF) impact – a precursor and indicator for global temperature change – by 10-90% over the next few decades. This emissions timing effect may overestimate (i) ethanol’s climate benefits over gasoline and (ii) the effectiveness of U.S. policies mandating and subsidizing ethanol. This work revisits the above studies, and builds upon existing models to quantify RF impacts across the corn ethanol life cycle. The emissions timing factor (ETF) is significantly smaller than previous estimates (2-13% depending on the chosen impact time frame), and the effect is dwarfed by uncertainty in the GHG emissions estimates. Nevertheless, ETF reduces ethanol’s probability of meeting the federal target of 20% GHG reduction relative to gasoline from 53% (according to EPA GHG estimates) to 7-29%. However, the small potential climate impacts from U.S. ethanol use may not actually be observable based on estimated initial increases in global average surface temperature of < 0.001 °C. About 25% of global primary energy production comes from NG, whose life cycle GHG emissions and potential future climate impacts from substituting coal are highly uncertain due to fugitive methane (CH4) emissions from the NG industry. Accurately quantifying the NG fugitive emissions (FE) rate – the percentage of produced NG, mainly CH4 and ethane (C2H6) – released to the atmosphere is challenging due to the size and complexity of the NG industry. Recent LCA estimates suggest that the current NG FE rate could be as high as 8% and 6%, from shale and conventional NG, respectively, and other bottom-up studies indicate even higher rates several decades ago. This work analyzes possible ranges of the global average NG FE rate based on atmospheric CH4, C2H6, and carbon isotope (δ13C-CH4) measurements recorded since 1984, and top-down modeling of their sources and sinks. Box-model, δ13C-CH4mass balance, and 3D-modeling results agree on best estimate NG FE rates of 3-5% (of dry NG production and dry NG composition) globally over the past decade, and 5-8% around 1990. Upper bound FE rates are 5% and 7% in 2010 and 2000, respectively. Best estimate and upper bound values may be overestimated because both assume lower bound emissions from oil and coal production as well as complete absence of natural hydrocarbon seepage. While LCA studies are useful for identifying processes with the greatest NG FE reduction potential, the recent high bottom-up estimates do not appear representative of the U.S. national average based on top-down modeling results. Given the steadily declining NG FE rates one may expect that further emissions abatement is possible if industry practices are further improved.",12/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714875.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The papers address a number of issues related to the operation and design of CCS-equipped plants with solvent storage and bypass, the effect of Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) on cycling of coal-fired power plants, and the EPA’s proposed CO2 emissions rule for existing power plants. In Chapter 2, I present results from a study of the design and operation of power plants equipped with CCS with flue gas bypass and solvent storage. I considered whether flue gas bypass and solvent storage could be used to increase the profitability of plants with CCS. Using a pricetaker profit maximization model, I evaluated the increase in NPV at a pulverized coal (PC) plant with an amine-based capture system, a PC plant with an ammonia-based capture system, and a natural gas combined-cycle plant with an amine-based capture system when these plants were equipped with an optimally sized solvent storage vessel and regenerator. I found that while flue gas bypass and solvent storage increased profitability at low CO2 prices, they ceased to do so at CO2 prices high enough for the overall plant to become NPV-positive. In Chapter 3, I present results from a Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch model of the PJM West power system. I quantify the increase in cycling of coal-fired power plants that results when complying with a 20% RPS using wind power, accounting for cycling costs not usually included in power plant bids. I find that while additional cycling does increase cycling-related production costs and emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOX, these increases are small compared to the overall reductions in production costs and air emissions that occur with high levels of wind. In proposing its existing power plant CO2 emissions standard, the Environmental Protection Agency determined that significant energy efficiency would be available to aid in compliance. In Chapter 4, I use an expanded version of the model of Chapter 3 to evaluate compliance with the standard with and without this energy efficiency, as well as under several other scenarios. I find that emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOX are relatively insensitive to the amount of energy efficiency available, but that production costs increase significantly when complying without efficiency. In complying with the EPA’s proposed existing power plant CO2 emissions standard, states will have the choice of whether to comply individually or in cooperation with other states, as well as the choice of whether to comply with a rate-based standard or a mass-based standard. In Chapter 5, I present results from a linear dispatch model of the power system in the continental U.S. I find that cooperative compliance reduces total costs, but that certain states will prefer not to cooperate. I also find that compliance with a mass-based standard increases electricity prices by a larger margin than does compliance with a rate-based standard, with implications for the distribution of surplus changes between producers and consumers.",2/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Low Carbon Policy and Technology in the Power Sector,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720458.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small appliances and computer devices (SACD), including mobile phones, contain significant amounts of precious metals including gold and platinum, the present value of which should serve as a key economic driver for many recycling decisions. However, a detailed analysis is required to estimate the economic value that is unrealized by incomplete recovery of these and other materials, and to ascertain how such value could be reinvested to improve recovery processes. I present a dynamic product flow analysis (dPFA) for SACD throughout Portugal, a European Union member, including annual data detailing product sales and industrial-scale preprocessing data for recovery of specific materials from devices. I employ preprocessing facility and metals pricing data to identify losses, and develop an economic framework around the value of recycling including uncertainty. I show that significant economic losses occur during preprocessing (over $70M USD unrecovered in computers and mobile phones, 2006-2014) due to operations that fail to target high value materials, and characterize preprocessing operations according to material recovery and total costs.

While reliable building codes are widely used in design, builders in developing countries often fail to meet acceptable standards. Structural defects are frequently identified too late, often after catastrophic collapse. In Kenya, more than eighty people have been killed, an over 290 injured, by collapsed buildings, since 2006. However, Kenya is not an exception. Throughout the world, in particular in countries with developing economies and growing populations, thousands of dangerously weak buildings will be built, and millions of people will be exposed to unnecessarily higher risks for generations. This research aims at contributing towards finding solutions to this problem by: 1) demonstrating that, in Kenya, many buildings are approved for occupation based on false material strength data produced by ineffective quality-control methods; 2) engaging the help of experts in Kenyan construction to list and ranked probable causes and plausible solutions to the problem of unsafe construction practices in Kenya; 3) presenting a method and a simulation model to estimate the damages in Nairobi (or other cities in Africa) in case of and earthquake, which can be used by policy makers when evaluating alternative policy interventions; and 4) proposing a strategy that combines the enforcement of quality reporting for construction, the open publication of the reports, the diffusion of non-destructive testing in construction, a risk communication program, and internet forums to help educate and provide guidance to the public in good construction practices.",12/9/24,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:57,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723218.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4WAJYGIB,thesis,2016,"Romano, Vincenzo",Ionospheric scintillation effects on gnss: monitoring and data treatment development,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1857837334?pq-origsite=primo,"The increasing importance of satellite navigation technologies in modern society implies that a deeper knowledge and a reliable monitoring of the scintillation phenomena are essential to warn and forecast information to the end users and system designers. In fact, warnings, alerts and forecasting of ionospheric conditions may wisely tune the development of GNSS-based services to obtain the necessary levels of accuracy, integrity, and immediacy for reliable life-critical applications. The PhD research project is within the framework of the longstanding NGI-INGV collaboration, increasingly consolidated in the framework of many international projects. NGI pioneered GPS ionospheric scintillation monitoring in Northern Europe with GISTM (GPS ionospheric scintillation and TEC monitor, Van Dierendonck et al., 1993; Van Dierendonck, 2001) receivers. Between June 2001 and December 2003, four units were installed in the UK and Norway mainland, covering the geographic latitudes from 53° N to 70° N. Data was stored and analysed, focusing on statistical analyses and impact for GNSS users (Rodrigues et al., 2004, Aquino et al., 2005a, Aquino et al., 2005b). These units were decommissioned in 2004 and, then, re-deployed together with additional new receivers, in UK, Norway, Italy and Cyprus. An additional station was deployed by the NGI in Dourbes, Belgium (in collaboration with the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium) between 2006 and 2011. INGV leads the ISACCO (Ionospheric Scintillation Arctic Campaign Coordinated Observations) project in the Arctic, started in 2003, in which frame the management of three GISTM receivers in Svalbard (De Franceschi et al., 2006) and another two at European mid-latitudes, Chania (Greece) and Lampedusa (Italy), is currently undertaken. The PhD research project contributed to the reinforcement of the NGI-INGV GISTM network developing monitoring, data management and quality tools. Such activities have supported the continuity and the control of the receiving stations, as well as the access and the preservation of the both real-time and historical data acquired. In fact, a robust, continuous data acquisition and a wise management of the GISTM network are of paramount importance for Space Weather applications, as they are the basis on which reliable forecasting and now-casting of possible effects on technological systems lean. Moreover, the possibility to use the data for scientific and applicative purposes depends upon well-established data quality procedures and upon a detailed knowledge of the sites in which each receiver comprising the network are deployed. Starting from these considerations, and in the framework of the aforementioned collaborative context, the PhD work aimed at improving the monitoring techniques and developing novel data processing to improve the data quality. Scintillation measurements are contaminated by multiple scattering encountered by the GNSS signal due to buildings, trees, etc. Such multipath sources need to be identified to keep the quality of the scintillation and TEC data as higher as possible. This can be achieved by removing these sources of errors or mitigating their effects by filtering the data. A novel station characterization technique has been introduced, developed and discussed in this thesis. The results demonstrated that this is a promising method to improve the quality of data (Romano et. al 2013). The results obtained so far motivated the development of the data filtering procedures. The filtering was aimed at filtering-out spurious, noisy data based on general assumptions about statistical data analysis (outlier analysis), thus efficiently removing multipath affected measurements and reducing the data loss with respect to applying a fixed elevation angle cut-off threshold. This is particularly important in case of not well covered regions (e.g. forests, deserts, oceans, etc.), as the field of view spanned by each antenna is optimized. During the PhD activities, the filtering technique has been also tested and validated against real and simulated data. To show how the development of the filtering method is able to efficiently clean multipath and signal degradation from GNSS data, it was applied in two different cases: - First, it was applied to the data published in a climatological study (Alfonsi et al. 2011), carried out with the NGI-INGV GISTM network at high-latitudes. Each station was characterized using the station characterization method, and then the data were filtered using the filtering method. Then, the new climatological maps were generated and compared to the original ones. The percentage of the filtered-out data obtained by applying the standard threshold of 20° on the elevation angle and the filtering technique for each station demonstrated how the latter is able to meaningfully reduce the data loss. The filtering extends the field of view of the network and, then, improves the capability of investigating the dynamics of the ionosphere over larger areas. - Second, the data used in this application were acquired by the CIGALA/CALIBRA network of PolaRxS receivers during the whole year of 2012. The elevation angle cut-off significantly reduced the capability of the network to depict the ionosphere northward of the geomagnetic equator and above the Atlantic Ocean, east of Brazil. This approach limited the data loss to 10-20%, while the traditional cut off of 15°-30° on the elevation angle led to losses of 35-45%. This method not only optimized the capability of GNSS networks, but also helped in planning the installation of additional new receivers aiming to enlarge network coverage in the framework of the CALIBRA project. The enlarged field of view made it possible to identify the increased occurrence of scintillation along the northern crest of the Equatorial Ionospheric Anomaly (EIA). To summarize and to introduce the reader into this thesis, specific issues here addressed are: - Development of software procedures and hardware designs to optimize the station configurations of the existing measurement network of GISTM (GPS Ionospheric Scintillation and TEC Monitor). - Development of techniques for remote, automatic instrument control and setting. - Development of data management tools to achieve quasi real-time data accessibility. - Development of data analysis methods to assess station characterization. - Development of techniques to perform data quality filtering. - Perform acquisition of experimental and simulation data. - Support scientific investigations through the high quality of the NGI-INGV network data.",2016,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,Ionospheric scintillation effects on gnss,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Ionospheric scintillation effects on gnss: monitoring and data treatment development,,,,,Data integrity; Ionosphere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work studies two different approaches to the optimal allocation of energy and reserves in the day-ahead generation scheduling process. Part I presents a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment model to co-optimize energy and the locational reserves required to respond to a set of uncertain generation contingencies, using a novel state-based formulation. The model is applied in an offer-based electricity market to allocate contingency reserves throughout the power grid, in order to comply with the N-1 security criterion under transmission congestion. The objective is to minimize expected dispatch and reserve costs, together with post contingency corrective redispatch costs, modeling the probability of generation failure and associated post contingency states. The characteristics of the scheduling problem are exploited to formulate a computationally efficient method, consistent with established operational practices. We simulated the distribution of locational contingency reserves on the IEEE RTS96 system and compared the results with the conventional deterministic method. We found that assigning locational spinning reserves can guarantee an N-1 secure dispatch accounting for transmission congestion at a reasonable extra cost. The simulations also showed little value of allocating downward reserves but sizable operating savings from co-optimizing locational nonspinning reserves. Overall, the results indicate the computational tractability of the proposed method. Part II presents a distributed generation scheduling model to optimally allocate energy and spinning reserves among competing generators in a day-ahead market. The model is based on the coordination between individual generators and a market entity. The proposed method uses forecasting, augmented pricing and locational signals to induce efficient commitment of generators based on firm posted prices. It is price-based but does not rely on multiple iterations, minimizes information exchange and simplifies the market clearing process. Simulations of the distributed method performed on a six-bus test system showed that, using an appropriate set of prices, it is possible to emulate the results of a conventional centralized solution, without need of providing make-whole payments to generators. Likewise, they showed that the distributed method can accommodate transactions with different products and complex security constraints.",12/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:26,,,,,,,Ensuring the Reliable Operation of the Power Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716279.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55UPF5T3,thesis,2019,"Sun, Xiaodi",Pollution Externalities and Emissions’ Consequences of the U.S. Electricity Sector,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Pollution_Externalities_and_Emissions_Consequences_of_the_U_S_Electricity_Sector/8223944/1,"The electricity sector generates externalities due to pollution that can have damaging impacts on human health, environment, ecology, and climate. This thesis focuses on three problems related to health, environmental and/or climate change externalities associated with the operation of the power sector. In Chapter 1, I estimate the trace elements mass flow rates from U.S. coal-fired power plants, a negative externality that is not well monitored at the plant level, except for gas phase emissions of Hg. I create a generalizable model for stochastically estimating trace element mass flow rates, specifically Hg, Se, As, and Cl, to solid, liquid, and gas phase waste streams of coal-fired power plants and evaluate the accuracy against available data. When compared with measured and reported data on trace element mass flow rates, I find that my model generally overestimates trace element concentrations in coal, leading to overestimation of trace element mass flow rates to the waste streams. The partitioning estimates are consistent for Se, As, and Cl removal from flue gas, but tend to underestimate Hg removal. Model performance would improve with access to more recent measurements of trace element concentrations in the coal blend, where data quality is the weakest. In Chapter 2, I focus on the issue of understanding the emissions of SO2, NOx and CO2 that would result from policies that would lead to an increased usage of coal. I also study the emissions consequences of turning off some of the currently installed air pollution technologies at U.S. coal power plants. While a coal resurgence is unlikely due to other market forces, an increase in coal electricity will cause increases in SO2, NOx and CO2, which have significant human health, environment, and climate consequences. I explore the potential consequences of an increase in coal generation under two bounding scenarios: 1) I assume that environmental regulations are weakened so that coal plants turn off their wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction devices and 2) I assume coal electricity becomes cheaper to operate than natural gas and displaces natural gas electricity. Turning off wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reactor devices leads to SO2 and NOx that would be twice to three times the emissions observed in 2017. These emissions levels were last observed about 7-10 years ago. A resurgence of coal that would displace natural gas would increase SO2, NOx, and CO2 emissions by 41%, 45%, and 21% compared to 2017 levels. In Chapter 3, I study the potential of deep decarbonization of the Pennsylvania electricity sector, which is an energy policy goal which would push coal out of the fuel mix. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Pennsylvania to 20% of 2005 levels by 2050. While deep decarbonization is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change, the infrastructure required to implement deep decarbonization can create significant land and forest impacts that may negatively impact ecology. I model pathways to deep decarbonize Pennsylvania’s electricity sector, quantify the land and forest land use from these pathways, and estimate potential ecological impacts using fragmentation indices. Even if all the coal plants retire, the emissions from current natural gas plants exceed the carbonization goals, suggesting that natural gas cannot be a bridge fuel. If only wind is built, the total land use is 13,300 km2 (Pennsylvania is 119,000 km2), with direct land use and forest land use impacts of 520 km2 and 370 km2, respectively. Solar farms are constructed across Pennsylvania, as there is insufficient land in the southeast where resources are highest, impacting 2400 km2 of forested land. As such, solar contributes to a greater loss of landscape than wind, but wind requires significantly more land allocated to deep decarbonize the Pennsylvania electricity sector. Through these three chapters, I find that energy policy needs to be assessed on a holistic basis by considering all possible cost and benefits of a potential policy. While policy goals, such as decarbonization of the electricity grid, will create obvious net benefits, energy interventions still need to be carefully planned out by decision makers to avoid and minimize other downstream problems. Other policy interventions, such as promoting more coal for the sake of grid reliability, may introduce such significant costs that they should be scrapped entirely.",6/5/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:34,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/8223944.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/3BWXJM23/Sun - 2019 - Pollution Externalities and Emissions’ Consequences of the U.S. Electricity Sector.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The focus, however, has been on bands below 95 GHz, which is the current limit of near-future commercial technologies. As wireless markets continue to grow, demand may arise for spectrum in still higher frequency bands in the sub-millimeter or Terahertz (THz) bands between 275 GHz and 10 THz. THz spectrum offers a promising opportunityto explore an abundance of greenfield spectrum for a variety of future applications. However, the THz spectrum has many challenges associated with deployment, scalability, mobility, efficiency, and viable use-cases. In this thesis, we explore the need for moving to THz band and how multiple technical and policy tools can be used to improve efficient deployment for dense mobile indoor THz systems.Although the implementation of THz communications is nearly a decade away and at the frontiers of technical research, it needs immediate attention from the regulators,operators, manufacturers, and academia. It is worthwhile exploring how THz spectrum might impact wireless network architectures, business/usage cases, and spectrum policy. THz can effectively champion the NextGen communication, for which we propose a framework that can manage the tradeoffs among THz resources and allow us to monitor and allocate these resources more opportunistically. Terahertz Access Points (APs) are susceptible to parameters, such as environmental uncertainties and surface materials, relative location with user equipment(UE), AP and UE density, relative mobility with UEs, antenna gains, infrastructure, and a whole host of regulatory and standards constraints. Properly managing theseparameters will be of critical importance for enabling the use of this higher frequency spectrum. Moreover, in the future, densification, and heterogeneity of APs and UEs will only make the problem more acute. These THz systems will need proper planning and deployment of resources, using technical and public-policy tools, to improve the system performance effectively. Although THz has been envisioned to be deployed for static and nomadic users in an indoor environment, multiple factors, such as small-scale mobility, blockage, and inefficient deployment of resources, can still cause significant outages in the THz. In this thesis, we present a set of technical and policy approaches that can be used for modeling and efficiently deploying indoor THz systems. We address these challenges by presenting four approaches: (a) smart mobility management using machine learning algorithms, (b) analytical model for efficient (power, spectrum and cost) deployment of dense THz-APs, (c) extending user coverage for dense THz- UEs using device-to-device (D2D) communication, and (d) policy analysis for THz spectrum allocation and propose granular resource allocation strategies.",8/25/20,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/12860516.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/TTMAL8ER/Singh - 2020 - Indoor Mobility Management and Efficient Deployment in the THz.pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5B3B7VFF,thesis,2015,"Noriega Campero, Alejandro; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Balancing utility and privacy of high-dimensional datasets: mobile phone metadata,,,,,,"Large-scale datasets of human behavior have the potential to fundamentally transform the way we develop cities, fight disease and crime, and respond to natural disasters. However, understanding the privacy of these data sets is key to their broad use and potential impact, for these consist of sensitive information such as citizens' geo-location. Moreover, recent research has shown adversarial methods that successfully associate sensitive information in the datasets to individuals, even under pseudonymization of all personal identifiers. This thesis conceptualizes, relates, and generalizes salient methodologies for disclosure analysis of pseudonymized data that have been developed in the last two decades, such as: k-anonymity, t-closeness, and unicity. Data at the core of the so-called ""big data"" revolution is fundamentally high-dimensional. We show implications of high-dimensionality as paradigmatic to modern disclosure analysis. Consequently, we propose and analyze a methodological framework that couples information-theoretic concepts from t-closeness and [delta]-disclosure with the partial adversarial knowledge model introduced by unicity [1] [2], as well as its possible extensions. The various methodologies were applied and compared on a large dataset of mobile phone records (CDRs), where results empirically showed ordinal equivalence among unicity measures and information distance measures EM-disclosure and KL-disclosure. Advantages of the proposed framework are highlighted, and future research avenues identified. We also investigate the tradeoff between data privacy and data usefulness related to mobile phone metadata (CDRs) and its real-world applications. On the disclosure side, four spatio-temporal points were enough to identify uniquely +95% of individuals, at a [ZIP code, 1 hour] spatiotemporal granularity - consistent with main results in the literature. As the dataset was coarsened in space and time, the ratio (unicity) decreased to values below 0.2% for data specified at [District, 1 week] granularity or lower. We confirmed the existence of a utility-privacy tradeoff for the 10 experts surveyed for this study, i.e., a positive relationship between reidentification risk and data utility. However, Pareto analysis revealed that several granularity levels (generalization profiles) are Pareto-suboptimal, thus the tradeoff is not strict. Non-strictness implies that not all privacy gains entail utility loss, and conversely, not all utility gains entail privacy loss. Results thus suggest that data policy decisions should rest on an understanding of the underlying privacy-utility tradeoff, as inefficient policies can otherwise be implemented, unnecessarily incurring in privacy or utility losses. Lastly we show that, due to ordinal equivalence tested on the CDR dataset, Pareto properties are preserved and thus these results on the utility-privacy tradeoff are invariant to assessing disclosure by information distance measures such as EM-disclosure and KL-disclosure. This work contributes to shed light on the privacy and utility tradeoff inherent to high-dimensional datasets of large societal systems. Its results and methodology are relevant for actors in both academic and policy domains, and germane as society engages in debate over technological and legal frameworks for potentially ubiquitous data generation and use.",2015,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,Balancing utility and privacy of high-dimensional datasets,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Balancing utility and privacy of high-dimensional datasets : mobile phone metadata,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decarbonization of the electric power system will likely eliminate most emissions from power plants, leaving only capacity costs of roughly 5% of subsidy disbursements. Thus, policy makers considering low income<br>subsidies as a means of ensuring that low-income households do not disproportionately bear the burden of an energy transition can use such estimates of price responsiveness to estimate any adjustments in peak capacity requirements that may result from increased demand. Chapter 4 uses an optimization-based techno-economic model to characterize the decision space<br>for deep decarbonization of liquid-dependent sectors such as aviation and long-distance road transportation. With today’s technology electrofuels, synthetic hydrocarbons produced using CO2 captured from the atmosphere and hydrogen from electrolysis of water, are likely a more<br>expensive mitigation strategy than continuing to use petroleum-based fuels and offsetting the resulting emissions with direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 with sequestration (DACS). However, if DAC and electrolyzer manufacturers are able to meet near-term cost targets, electrofuels may<br>be competitive with DACS if the cost of petroleum fuels rises substantially or if sequestration costs are higher than anticipated. Several decades into the future, electrofuel costs may fall as low as $2.70 per gallon of gasoline equivalent, potentially achieving cost parity with petroleum<br>fuels. Electrofuel cost is most sensitive to the capital cost the DAC, electrolyzer, and renewable electricity systems, confirming their importance as priorities for research, development, and deployment (RD&amp;D). However, without the operational flexibility afforded by storage or supplementary natural gas or grid electricity interconnections, costs could rise by more than 80%. This points to some less intuitive RD&amp;D priorities, such as metallic phase change materials<br>capable of storing heat above 900°C and low-cost, seasonal CO2 storage. As a whole, this work aims to characterize the depth the uncertainties posed by the task of energy<br>transition while synthesizing insights from analysis of historical data and modeling based on engineering knowledge and expert judgment to gain policy-relevant insights into pathways toward deep decarbonization of the energy system. I hope this represents a small step toward a<br>decision-making paradigm capable of addressing the deep uncertainties we face while using the wealth of data and insight at our disposal to chart a thoughtful course ahead. <br>",2019,5/20/25 17:13,5/20/25 17:13,5/20/25 17:13,5699134 Bytes,,,,,,Decisions and Uncertainties in the US Energy System,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 5699134 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to the current standard, ATSC 1.0, the 3.0 version will provide local broadcasters, among other things, 1) the ability toreplace a broadcaster’s single transmitter with a multi-transmitter Single Frequency Network (SFN) transmission architecture, 2) a flexible physical layer that allows broadcasters control over the trade-offs between bitrate, coverage and capacity, 3) additional program carrying capacity due to better source and channel coding, and 4) a full-IP platform able to perform interactive TV andtargeted advertising. This new standard will not only bring significant value to broadcast television services but also may reshape the broadcast television industry while both raising challenges for the existing U.S. regulatory frameworkand creating new opportunities to realize regulatory goals. Given this context, the thesis addresses some of the economic and public policy implications of a next-generation ATSC 3.0 television standard. This thesis is composed of three techno-economic studies that examinetelevision spectrum management and policy options related to three distinctive issues. In a first study, we analyze the potential of SFNs to improve broadcast spectrum efficiency by reducing spectrum reuse distances betweenbroadcasters’ coverage areas, thus potentially freeing spectrum for other uses such as cellular service. In a second study we analyze the flexibility given byATSC 3.0 to increase (or reduce) broadcasters coverage areas while still adhering to the power and interference constraints of their existing spectrum licenses,and the effect of reducing broadcasters authorized transmit power on freeing additional spectrum for additional TV licensees. Additional spectrum licenses could also facilitate simulcasting during the (likely lengthy) transitionfrom ATSC 1.0 to ATSC 3.0. Finally, in a third study we consider how using ATSC 3.0 to increase a station’s reach may result in increasing coverage overlapbetween same-network affiliates with implications for inter-market competition and retransmission consent. Together, these studies will provide insight to policymakers to facilitate understanding of some of the new economic andpolicy issues that could arise from the emergence of ATSC 3.0.",8/10/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7207619.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5JH5IBWN,thesis,2014,"Li, Yuanjian Carla; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",Value of more sophistication: capital investment decision-making with competitive dynamics in the mining industry,,,,,,"In many mining markets, one of the central business planning decisions faced by firms is where, when, and by how much to expand their production capacity. Appropriate investment planning methodology is important to both the mining industry and the wider economy. Currently, new mine investment decisions are most often based on the classic project evaluation methodology of discounted cash flow analysis (DCF) applied to the individual potential projects, which is flawed in its inadequate consideration of risk and flexibility, of impact on the profit of the firm, and of competitive dynamics in oligopoly markets. More sophisticated methods that account for these complexities have been proposed in academic literature; however, their value in realistic market settings has been little demonstrated in past literature and they are rarely adopted in practice. This thesis compares four investment decision paradigms of increasing scope and complexity in a three-firm mineral commodity market, based primarily on the firm-level cash flow NPV outcome in Monte Carlo simulations of the market. The analysis is conducted for various market scenarios of different demand growth patterns, volatility, demand elasticity, and supply structure. Simulation results show that in almost all scenarios, the game theoretic and option-based best-firm-NPV policies outperform the positive-mine-NPV policy substantially for all firms, regardless their market and cost position. However, the difference between the best-firm-NPV policy and the positive-firm-NPV policy is often small, depending on the scenario. Overall, the evaluation conducted in this thesis contributes to our understanding of how useful having more sophisticated investment decision methods might be to the firms and under what market conditions.",2014,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,Value of more sophistication,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Value of more sophistication : capital investment decision-making with competitive dynamics in the mining industry,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These technologies have enabled us to recognize many forms of community—from close knit social groups to individuals who merely co-habit public spaces—and to support interaction with each other in novel ways. The notion that modern digital technology holds promises of democratization by expanding access to information and broadening modes of knowledge production often fails to acknowledge that these benefits rely upon devices and infrastructure whose availability reflect socioeconomic contours; that the technologies that enable information access can also reinforce rather than obviate marginality due to barriers to access and suitability. This assessment points to opportunities for better understanding and better designing technologies for the marginalized or dispossessed. The research presented in this dissertation discusses the findings from empirical, theoretical, and design based investigations of technology use with the urban homeless. The empirical work provides a foundation for understanding current technology practices among the homeless and their care providers. The theoretical investigation develops Deweyan publics as a novel frame for participatory design. The design-based investigation presents findings from the design and deployment of the Community Resource Messenger at a shelter for homeless mothers. The results of this research shed light on impact of social computing platforms on social service provision and on the ways the staff and residents used the Community Resource Messenger as a resource for identifying common issues and taking action to contend with those issues.",2011,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,Community resource messenger,,,,,Georgia Institute of Technology,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Community resource messenger: A mobile system and design exploration in support of the urban homeless ISBN: 9781124997148,,,,,Computer science; Information technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5M2NGCZ2,thesis,2018,"Fletcher, Sarah Marie; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Learning and flexibility for water supply infrastructure planning under diverse uncertainties,,,,,,"Water supply infrastructure planning faces many uncertainties. Uncertainty in short-term in rainfall and runoff, groundwater storage, and long-term climate change impacts water supply forecasts. Population and economic growth drive urban water demand growth at rapid but uncertain rates. Overbuilding infrastructure can lead to expensive stranded assets and unnecessary environmental impacts, while under building can cause reliability outages with impacts on the economy, ecosystems, and human health. This dissertation assesses the potential for Bayesian learning about uncertainty to enable flexible, adaptive approaches in which infrastructure can be changed over time to reduce cost risk while achieving reliability targets. It develops a novel planning framework that: 1) classifies uncertainties and applies appropriate, differentiated uncertainty analysis tools, 2) applies Bayesian inference to physical models of hydrology and climate to develop dynamic uncertainty estimates, and 3) uses stochastic dynamic programming and engineering options analysis to assess the value of flexibility in mitigating cost and reliability risk. This framework is applied to three applications. Chapter 3 evaluates the potential for modular desalination design to manage multiple, diverse uncertainties -- streamflow, demand growth, and the cost of water shortages -- in Melbourne, Australia. Chapter 4 addresses uncertainty in groundwater resources in desalination planning in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Chapter 5 addresses model uncertainty in climate change projections in a dam design problem in Mombasa, Kenya. Across all three applications, we find value in flexible infrastructure planning with a 9-28% reduction in expected cost. However, the performance of flexible approaches compared to traditional robust approaches varies considerably and is influenced by technology choice, economies of scale, discounting, the presence of irreducible stochastic variability, and the value society places on water reliability.",2018,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2018 Ph.D.,Book Title: Learning and flexibility for water supply infrastructure planning under diverse uncertainties,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stroke ranks the third as the leading cause of death in the United States behind heart disease and cancer. The survivors of stroke suffer from various degrees of long-term disability which create a severe financial burden on society. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) provides some of the best stroke treatment in the United States, but containing costs of conventional care without compromising access and quality of care remains a challenge. A telemedicine network between UPMC Stroke Institute (hub) and selected regional hospitals (spokes) was established to address the challenge. This cost-benefits study presents comparing telestroke treatment plan with that of conventional stroke to determine the viability of the telestroke approach. The economic evaluation was designed to inform the decision on whether or not to continue with the telestroke treatment of patients with blocked arteries from acute ischemic stroke. The group of patients selected for telestroke was treated via teleconsultation, whereas the conventional care group was treated at the stroke center. Both groups were evaluated by the same team of neurologists and received similar treatment, during the same period. Functional outcomes were obtained prospectively and were measured using the modified Rankin Scale. A Markov decision analytic model employing the Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine the cost-benefits (incremental net monetary benefits) of the two healthcare strategies. The model was constructed by using data obtained from UPMC, Pennsylvania Cost Containment Council, The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program, and the medical literature. The data was entered into the TreeAge Pro software package version 2011(TreeAge Pro Inc. of Williamstown, MA, USA), for modeling. The data was synthesized, processed, and output presented in text, numeric, and graphical form. The results showed that the telestroke treatment cost $14,336 less than that of conventional stroke. Although telestroke was found to be more effective than conventional care, the difference was not significant. Telestroke showed an incremental net monetary benefit over conventional care by $20,387 when the willingness to pay (WTP) value was set at $86,461. The WTP was based on the statistical value of life established by the EPA as $6.9 million, and an average life expectancy of 78 years. Telestroke is a viable alternative to conventional care for treating acute ischemic stroke with IVtPA, if the treatment is accomplished within three hours of the initial onset of stroke, and when a vascular neurologist is not readily available at the spoke site.

5VQSPE92,thesis,2023,"Jin, Yan; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems","Networks, polarization, and voting: models for information aggregation in social settings",,,,,,"Social networks, voting, and polarization all fall into the realm of the instrument, process, and consequence of information aggregation in social settings. These are both classical topics that have motivated studies from various disciplines, and active areas in need of new models as novel phenomenon, demand, and proposals continue to emerge in recent years. In this thesis, we study three models for social information aggregation inspired by these three topics respectively. In the first chapter, we consider how to detect corruption when each network nodes' true identities are only locally known. In this model, each vertex reports about the types - truthful or corrupt -- of its neighbors, where truthful nodes report the true types and corrupt nodes report adversarially. We show that detecting corruption in this model yields linear-time algorithm while the minimal number of nodes the corrupt party needs to control in order to hide all corruption is hard to approximate to any multiplicative factor, assuming the Small Set Expansion Hypothesis. In the second chapter, we propose a geometric opinion dynamic model where a strong form of polarization in high-dimension emerges: public opinions not only radicalize on each issue, but also correlate across issues. We demonstrate that this type of polarization could arise as an unintended byproduct of influencers' natural effort to promote a product or an idea. We analyze this mechanism with one or more influencers, sending messages strategically, heuristically, or randomly, and examine the computational aspects of optimal influencing strategy and its effect on polarization. The third chapter considers whether distributed election procedure can aggregate to good social choice outcomes when voters delegate strategically. We model liquid democracy as a game where voters with continuous-valued preference peaks choose between delegation and learning about policies at a cost and voting directly. We derive the pure-strategy coalition-proof Nash equilibrium and show that equilibrium delegation network varies with learning cost. When cost is low, all voters delegate to the median is a cpNE. As learning cost increases, new forms of cpNE emerge, where extreme voters delegate inward and moderate voters delegate outward to the nearest incentized voters.",2023,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,"Networks, polarization, and voting",,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Networks, polarization, and voting : models for information aggregation in social settings",,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To reach these goals requires the development of new technologies that only innovation-driven enterprises (IDEs), not small businesses, have the ability to create. IDEs tend to form around one another in clusters known as innovation ecosystems. According to the MIT IDE framework, four elements are necessary for the prosperous growth of an innovation ecosystem: capacity of innovation and entrepreneurship, social structure, economic structure, and underlying institutions. If a region has a desire to create an innovation ecosystem capable of producing IDEs that have a carbon neutral focus, they must adequately develop each of these four elements in a strategic manner. Copenhagen, Denmark and Oslo, Norway are two cities which have made a commitment to become 100% carbon neutral. To achieve their goals, they are growing innovation ecosystems with a focus towards carbon neutrality. Applying the MIT IDE framework to the current progress of these two regions reveals recommendations for future areas of development which will quicken their success. These recommendations include 1) generating significant demand and providing early stage investment for companies with carbon neutral goals, 2) collecting better data about green innovation and economic growth against which the regions can benchmark their progress, and 3) crafting supportive policies which allow current infrastructure to become available for new technology testing.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Building innovation ecosystems to drive carbon neutral sustainability goals,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, chemical transport models (CTMs) can help evaluate scientific understanding of UFPs and quantify human exposure.In this work, we deploy a state-of-the-science CTM, PM-CAMx-UF at high resolution (1 km) over Pittsburgh in winter and summer to simulate UFP concentrations and explore the model’s ability to resolve intraurban spatial and temporal variability in UFP concentrations. We evaluate model predictions against an extensive intraurban network of ~30 long-term UFP and ~50 other pollutant observations sites. Simulations quantify the sources of UFPs within an urban area, and we assess the value-added from increasing model resolution to 1 km. Model inputs include particle number emissions derived from source-specific particle size distributions. Moreover, for traffic sources, we derive spatially resolved emissions from a traffic model for Pittsburgh.Baseline simulations for February and July 2017 indicate predicted particle number concentrations (PNC) in Pittsburgh vary by more than a factor of two at 1-km resolution, with similar levels of intraurban and urban-rural variability in both winter and summer.

Temporally, the model matches winter diurnal variability in PNC at 12 sites with r2 values of monthly average observations and predictions exceeding 0.28 spread across all site types.

Further warming is expected to have a profound effect on the functioning of ecological and human systems worldwide. While it is a top priority to limit carbon emissions and mitigate future climate change, it is also essential to prepare for damages from climate change in the remainder of this century. Research is needed to understand these impacts, and whether it is possible to adapt to these changes. In this thesis, I measure damages and adaptation to recent climate change in three essays. First, in joint work with Sylvia Klosin, I develop a novel debiased machine learning approach to measure continuous treatment effects in panel settings. We demonstrate benefits of this estimator over standard machine learning or classical statistics approaches. We apply this estimator to measure the degree of damages from climate change in U.S. agriculture, and find that extreme heat is significantly more damaging than linear models suggest. In the second essay, I measure the degree of adaptation to extreme heat in U.S. agriculture using flexible modeling of weather variables and a debiased machine learning estimator. I demonstrate that my double machine learning approach works well in high-dimensional settings. Applying this estimator to the past thirty years of crop yields, I find evidence of considerable adaptation to extreme heat. Finally, I examine the equity of adaptation to increasing wildfire risk in California.

66APNGH5,thesis,2010,"Funahashi, Yoshifuru; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Comparative analysis of aviation safety information feedback systems,,,,,,"In the aviation system, there are several feedback systems to prevent an accident. First of all, the accident and serious incident reporting and investigation system is established by the Chicago Convention. In general, once an accident or a serious incident occurs, it must be reported to the Investigation Authority in the state where the event occurred. The Investigation Authority which receives the report conducts the investigation of the event. Then, based on the probable causes identified, the Investigation Authority issues the recommendations to the Civil Aviation Authority. Next, the Civil Aviation Authority which receives the recommendations takes corrective actions, including rule-making, to prevent the recurrence of the event. This feedback system ensures that an accident with the same causes will not occur again. The feedback system described above can be considered a reactive approach. There are also proactive feedback systems to prevent an accident. In order to identify hazards that could potentially lead to an accident, the contracting states of the Convention have mandatory reporting systems for incidents. In addition, some contracting states even have voluntary reporting systems for safety-related occurrences not limited to formally defined incidents. If these feedback systems are utilized to the full extent. they could help in reducing the accident rate. This thesis, aiming at offering insights for responsible authorities in contracting states of the Chicago Convention to improve their aviation safety information feedback systems, conducted a comparative analysis of the feedback systems in four contracting states of the Chicago Convention: the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Japan. This thesis examined both mandatory reporting systems and voluntary reporting systems in each state. Furthermore, this thesis examined the rule-making process in each Civil Aviation Authority as part of the feedback systems. This thesis identified several differences in the feedback systems in the four states. In particular, this thesis identified a relatively larger number of differences in voluntary reporting systems than in mandatory reporting systems. On the other hand, as regards the rulemaking process, this thesis showed that there are no substantial differences.",2010,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: Comparative analysis of aviation safety information feedback systems,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meeting this increased demand will require both technology innovations, but also new ways of thinking about the costs of implementing these technologies. This dissertation examines electrochemical energy storage technologies at multiple phases of the product cycle to assess how to meet some of the challenges associated with widespread adoption of electrochemical energy storage. Using a process-based cost model to identify the factors that contribute most to battery manufacturing cost, I find that economies of scale cost reductions have largely already been achieved. However, changes in cell design parameters can help to lower the per kWh cost of lithium-ion cells. Looking at a use case for energy storage in a hybrid microgrid, I find that both battery chemistry characteristics and technology costs impact the overall performance of hybrid microgrids and the cost of delivering electricity. As more batteries are produced to meet growing demand, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with battery manufacturing and waste disposal will become increasingly important. Using an attributional life cycle analysis, I compare the emissions associated with two different recycling processes: pyrometallurgical recycling and direct cathode recycling. While pyrometallurgical recycling does not offer emissions reductions, direct cathode recycling does have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, even if the cathode recovery process has relatively low yield rates. Using these recovered cathode materials is contingent on a market that will accept these recycled materials. A survey of current electric vehicle owners shows that consumer preferences about battery materials differ depending on whether consumers purchased a plug-in hybrid or an all electric vehicle. Overall, plug-in hybrid vehicle owners seem to have a slightly negative perception of recycled battery materials. For electric vehicle owners that have an all-electric vehicle, there are more diverse preferences, with groups that have positive, negative, and indifferent preferences about the type of battery material used in their vehicle. The heterogeneous preferences of different electric vehicle owners could enable different trends in material recovery and reuse as the number of electric vehicles on the road, and the battery energy storage used for transportation, increase.",3/1/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Battery Energy Storage for Maturing Markets,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714944.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6EUD34ZV,thesis,2018,"Majumder, Maimuna S.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Modeling transmission heterogeneity for infectious disease outbreaks,,,,,,"The transmissibility of a given infectious disease is often described by its basic reproduction number (Ro) - namely, the average number of secondary infections caused by an index case in a fully susceptible population. Typical approaches to modeling transmission dynamics associated with infectious disease outbreaks frequently use Ro to produce deterministic case count projections, in effect treating the affected population as homogeneous (i.e. as if every individual in the population interest has an equal likelihood of passing on the infection of interest). As a result, such approaches often fail to effectively capture transmission dynamics during real-world outbreaks in heterogeneous populations. Here, we use analytical and simulation methods to show that the treatment of Ro as the mean of a random variable (thus permitting the estimation of non-deterministic case count projections) allows us to better assess outbreak trajectory and likelihood of disease propagation in non-homogeneous populations (Chapter 2). We then empirically investigate predictors of in-population transmission heterogeneity (i.e. the fact that some individuals in a given population are more likely than others to pass on the infection of interest) within the context of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in South Korea using a combination of statistical- and review-driven approaches (Chapter 3). Then, in Chapter 4, we explore how in-population transmission heterogeneity can be used to our advantage through the deployment of risk-informed interventions (i.e. in which individuals who are more likely to pass on the infection of interest are exclusively targeted to receive the intervention) during infectious disease outbreaks. More specifically, we use the analytical and simulation methods first introduced in Chapter 2 - paired with inpopulation transmission heterogeneity data from Chapter 3 - to compare the utility of a variance-informed deployment scheme against a traditional, uniform deployment scheme (i.e. in which every individual has an equal likelihood of receiving the intervention). Finally, building off of our findings in Chapters 2, 3, and 4, we recommend four interrelated policies in Chapter 5 that aim to (1) normalize the treatment and reporting of Ro as the mean of a random variable and (2) improve access to the data required to sufficiently capture population heterogeneity when modeling disease propagation.",2018,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2018 Ph.D.,Book Title: Modeling transmission heterogeneity for infectious disease outbreaks,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6FTCC8FS,thesis,2019,"Zhang, Peter Yun; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Dynamic and robust network resource allocation,,,,,,"Networks are essential modeling tools in engineering, business, and public policy research. They can represent physical connections, such as manufacturing processes. They can be relationships among people, such as patient treatment in healthcare. They can also represent abstract interactions, such as the biological reaction between a certain vaccine and a certain virus. In this work, we bring several seemingly disparate problems under the same modeling framework, and show their thematic coherence via the angle of dynamic optimization on networks. Our research problems are drawn from business risk management, public health security, and public policy on vaccine selection. A common theme is the integrative design of (1) strategic resource placement on a network, and (2) operational deployment of such resources. We outline the research questions, challenges, and contributions as follows. Modern automotive manufacturing networks are complex and global, comprising tens of thousands of parts and thousands of plants and suppliers. Such interconnection leaves the network vulnerable to disruptive events. A good risk mitigation decision support system should be data-driven, interpretable, and computational efficient. We devise such a tool via a linear optimization model, and integrate the model into the native information technology system at Ford Motor Company. In public security, policymakers face decisions regarding the placement of medical resources and training of healthcare personnel, to minimize the social and economic impact of potential large scale bio-terrorism attacks. Such decisions have to integrate the strategic positioning of medical inventories, understanding of adversary's behavior, and operational decisions that involve the deployment and dispensing of medicines. We formulate a dynamic robust optimization model that addresses this decision question, apply a tractable solution heuristic, and prove theoretical guarantees of the heuristic's performance. Our model is calibrated with publicly available data to generate insights on how the policymakers should balance investment between medical inventory and personnel training. The World Health Organization and regional public health authorities decide on the influenza (flu) vaccine type ahead of flu season every year. Vaccine effectiveness has been limited by the long lead time of vaccine production - during the production period, flu viruses may evolve and vaccines may become less effective. New vaccine technologies, with much shorter production lead times, have gone through clinical trials in recent years. We analyze the question of optimal vaccine selection under both fast and slow production technologies. We formulate the problem as a dynamic distributionally robust optimization model. Exploiting the network structure and using tools from discrete convex analysis, we prove some structural properties, which leads to informative comparative statics and tractable solution methods. With publicly available data, we quantify the societal benefit of current and future vaccine production technologies. We also explore the reduction in disease burden if WHO expand vaccine portfolio to include more than one vaccine strain per virus subtype. In each of the applications, our main contributions are four-fold. First, we develop mathematical models that capture the decision process. Second, we provide computational technology that can efficiently process these models and generate solutions. Third, we develop theoretical tools that guarantee the performance of these computational technology. Last, we calibrate our models with real data to generate quantitative and implementable insights.",2019,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2019 Ph.D.,Book Title: Dynamic and robust network resource allocation,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The costs and benefits of low carbon technology options are unique and affect different market participants in different ways. In this thesis, we examine the cost effectiveness of carbon mitigation technologies and policies from the social perspective and from the perspective of consumers. In Chapter 2, we perform an engineering-economic analysis of hybridizing concentrating solar thermal power with fossil fuel. We examine the cost effectiveness of substituting the solar power for new coal or gas and find the cost of mitigation to be approximately ~$130/tCO2 to ~$300/tCO2. In Chapter 3, we quantify some externalized social costs and benefits of wind energy. We estimate the costs due to variability and transmission unique to wind to have an expected value of ~$20/MWh. In Chapter 4, we quantify the cost effectiveness of a renewable portfolio standard and a carbon price from the perspective of consumers in restructured markets. We find that both that the RPS can be more cost effective than a carbon price for consumers under certain circumstances: continued excess supply of capacity, retention of nuclear generators, and high natural gas prices. In Chapter 5, we examine the implications of lowering electricity sector CO2 emissions in PJM through a Low Carbon Capacity Standard (LCCS). We estimate that an LCCS would supply the same amount of energy (105,000 GWh) as the RPS’s in PJM and an additional ~10 GW of capacity. We find that the LCCS could be more cost effective for consumers than an RPS if it lowered capacity prices.",9/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715433.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6J6JYXL9,thesis,2015,"Ellman, Douglas; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",The reference electrification model: a computer model for planning rural electricity access,,,,,,"Despite efforts from governments and other organizations, hundreds of millions of people-primarily in Africa and South Asia-still have no electricity service. Electrification efforts have historically been focused on extension of the main electric grid, but technology developments have made off-grid power systems, such as microgrids and home systems, viable alternatives for some areas. Especially since rural electrification typically depends on limited subsidies, if universal electrification is to be achieved in a timely manner, smart planning is essential to ensure that resources are directed towards cost-efficient technical solutions. Since the areas requiring electrification are expansive, the technology choices are many, and experience with off-grid systems is limited, planners struggle to evaluate tradeoffs between technology choices and estimate project costs. This thesis demonstrates that computer models that can automatically produce cost-efficient designs to the individual customer level can provide significant value to the planning process. The development of such a model by the author and collaborators at MIT and Comillas University, called the Reference Electrification Model (REM), is described. REM uses a series of heuristics to process input data, identify areas better suited for on-grid or off-grid electrification, and produce technical designs for recommended grid-extension and off-grid projects. In addition to the current state of REM, the rationale for model design choices and recommendations for future developments are described. The process and results of a pilot application of REM to Vaishali District, in Bihar, India are also described. REM will only be useful if it is actually incorporated into planning processes. In this spirit, concepts for how models like REM can benefit the regulation of rural electrification are presented, with a focus on India.",2015,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,The reference electrification model,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: The reference electrification model : a computer model for planning rural electricity access,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Najeeb; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; System Design and Management Program; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",Improving trade visibility and fidelity in defense requirements portfolio management,,,,,,"In 2003, the Department of Defense (DoD) requirements process migrated from a bottom-up, threat-based force-planning method to a capability-based, top-down approach with the introduction of the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS). The primary objective of the JCIDS process is to ensure the capabilities required by the joint warfighter are identified, assessed, validated, and prioritized in a transparent process that allows for a balanced and informed decision. Although JCIDS continues to evolve, criticisms remain: solution development and delivery are not timely; the process is complex; and it lacks mechanisms to focus the review across portfolios; to name a few. It is imperative to address these fundamental issues as the DoD is now forced to operate within a severely constrained fiscal environment - the DoD must gain better insight and visibility across its defense requirements portfolio. This thesis seeks to address these issues through the application of Systems Engineering techniques, specifically an Enterprise Strategic Analysis and Semantic Architecture review, to the JCIDS process. The Enterprise Strategic Analysis reveals the critical stakeholder interactions as well as nuances of the landscape in which JCIDS functions. This is followed by a detailed Semantic Architecture review of sample documents within the JCIDS process to inform a knowledge base.

Employing panel data, I analyze three issues related to the diffusion of ICTs in the scientific communities of less developed areas: 1) access; 2) interaction; 3) and involvement. More specifically, I examine the way in which human capital, family structure, travel experiences, contextual factors, and technological antecedents interact with gender to influence access to and use of personal computers, email, and the Web. From there, I incorporate technological behavioral changes to predict interaction within professional networks. In the last step, I incorporate professional network measures to examine the gendered nature of research outcomes in the form of scientific productivity.The results suggest that over time ICTs have rapidly diffused within the three locations. At the same time, women continue to report less long-term access to email and the web. Furthermore, men and women are distinctly different in terms of intensity and extent of email and web use with women emerging as less technologically oriented. In spite of the differences on these measures, men are not earlier adopters of the technologies than women. It does not appear, however, that there is a consistent relationship between greater email use and integration within professional networks. Gender, on the other hand, emerges as one of the most consistent predictors of network outcomes, particularly in terms of absolute network size, geographic and gender diversity, and the proportion of male contacts reported.Finally, men and women are equally productive in domestic venues, but women are less productive in foreign venues. Furthermore, network structure is not as strongly related to productivity as are changes in technological use behavior. Respondents using email for a wider variety of reasons over time produce more in foreign and domestic venues, but intensity of email use is actually negatively related to productivity, suggesting that it is not technology use in general that matters when predicting outcomes, but the type of technology use. Network structure on the other hand, is only a significant predictor of domestic productivity.",2009,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,Women and Science in Development,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Women and Science in Development: A Longitudinal Analysis of Gender, Networks, and Information Technology in Ghana, Kenya, and India ISBN: 9798802775530",,,,,Behavior; Communication; Developing countries; Digital divide; Economic development; Economics; Equality; Freedom of information; Globalization; Information technology; Internet access; Mass media; Occupations; Sex differences; Social change; Social networks; Sociology; System theory; Telecommunication; Women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6Q75FBR6,thesis,2015,"Yiu, Lisa","Integration in China's public schools: Citizenship, schooling, and rural migrant youth in urban China",,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1720329926?pq-origsite=primo,"Worldwide, there is increasing concern towards the societal integration of youth with irregular citizenship status, whose migration as long-term residents is unwanted even though their parents' economic labor is valued. New forms of fragmented citizenship emerge as globalization processes rupture the relationship between residence and citizenship rights. The loosening of borders permit migrants to enter as workers, but deny political and legal status to their children. With limited citizenship rights to access education and socio-economic mobility opportunities, these immigrant youth face formidable structural barriers for societal assimilation. How does citizenship status shape educational access and societal outcomes for children in the societies where they call ""home,"" but lack full citizenship rights? The four papers of my study investigate citizenship as a global axis of educational inequality through a case study on China. With China's surge of rural-to-urban migration, the social integration of 20 million rural migrant children has emerged as an urgent policy issue since the 1990s. Rural migrant children, who are born in the cities or move to the cities with their migrant worker parents, are unable to access urban public schools. Migrant youth's exclusion from accessing urban schooling originates from the hukou system, a domestic system of rural and urban citizenship that excludes rural hukou holders from urban school access since the 1950s. The hukou system—which has been compared to national citizenship regimes in other nation states — remains a significant factor in shaping the educational and, thus, life opportunities of migrants in Shanghai, Beijing, and other large migrant-receiving metropolises. Since citizenship regimes are a powerful state instrument that exclude foreigners, the challenges that migrant youth face in obtaining social services in Chinese cities are comparable to those of transnational immigration in other societies, particularly undocumented immigration. Moreover, as local citizenship constitutes an important axis of educational stratification in China, China's political and institutional responses to migrant children thus provides a critical lens into the controversies and challenges confronting governments worldwide with the provision of schooling opportunities to those at the margins of society. The four papers of my dissertation apply different methodologies—critical discourse analysis, multivariate analysis, and grounded theory techniques—to investigate the integration of rural migrant children into urban schools and, more broadly, urban society. Collectively, the chapters offer distinct, but complementary perspectives on how rural migrant youth's negative experiences in public schools may actually undermine their integration within Chinese urban society. I draw upon rare interview access with municipal policymakers in Beijing and Shanghai during 2011-13; a collection of central and local government documents; 2009 survey data of Beijing schools from Peking's China Institute for Educational Finance Research; and 2011-13 ethnographic data in two Shanghai middle schools. As one of the first projects on Chinese rural migrant adolescents' experiences of school integration by a U.S.-based scholar, my research contributes new insights on the hukou citizenship debates and a unique perspective on China's future. My findings illustrate the influence of global paradigms on municipal citizenship reforms, which expand educational access to migrant children; the relative importance of family background above school context in shaping migrant children's educational expectations; the disadvantage of citizenship status in receiving fewer opportunities to learn in the classroom; and migrant youth's development of a citizenship-based, reactive identity in response to school marginalization. Importantly, my dissertation reveals how school exposure may undermine migrant youth's socio-cultural assimilation and offers important policy lessons to governments faced with the challenge of integrating immigrant youth. Further, it makes distinctive contributions to the understanding of processes of educational policy borrowing across nations; the interdisciplinary study of education, migration and nation-building; constructivist analysis of social identity; and the ethnographic study of society-school relationship.",2015,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,Integration in China's public schools,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Integration in China's public schools: Citizenship, schooling, and rural migrant youth in urban China ISBN: 9781339155364",,,,,"Comparative education; Education and state; Education, Compulsory; Educational attainment; Educational change; Educational equalization; Educational sociology; Public schools; Teenagers; Urban schools",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This increases the complexity of the decision-making process, requiring interventions that can help groups tradeoff multiple objectives and avoid suboptimal decisions. I focus on two critical problems faced by groups of system designers that have been incompletely explored in behavioral and decision science domain: generating efficient designs and reaching group consensus. I develop and test two classes of behavioral interventions to address these problems: real-time feedback and consensus-driven group recommender systems. Although these have the potential to help groups generate better designs and reach consensus, they lack quantitative evidence of their effectiveness and feasibility to improve group decision-making processes in techno-economic analyses. The objective of this thesis is to provide quantitative evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of those interventions using behavioral experiments in a laboratory setting. I achieved these objectives by recruiting a wide range of participants (students, laypeople in the general public, experts in an emerging technology), organizing them into groups, and evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of the interventions on helping them to improve their decisionmaking in three different techno-economic areas. I first evaluated the effectiveness of providing real-time feedback to groups of students tasked with designing a complex wastewater management system with multiple objectives. Later, I extend the behavioral experiment framework to build and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using a consensus-driven recommender system to help groups of laypeople to come to a consensus for climate change policy.

Improving technology forecasting is important because these forecasts are used by public and private decision-makers to inform decisions and create policies. Technology forecasts are intended to help decision-makers anticipate future events, avoid surprises, set priorities, and allocate resources effectively. To that end, technology forecasts should be both as accurate as possible and include uncertainty, so that decision-makers know how heavily to rely on them. However, when technology forecasts have been assessed retrospectively, they are often shown to not be very accurate. Generally, only people with expertise in engineering and technology are consulted when making technology forecasts. This dissertation describes the development and demonstration of an improved method of technology forecasting that includes consideration of policy, economic, and social factors that may affect how a technology develops. It is designed to help forecasters better imagine and think more systematically about factors beyond a technology itself that may shape its future. This dissertation provides evidence for the efficacy of this method of including policy, economic, and social factors in improving technology forecasting. The first chapter of this dissertation presents an overview of the few publicly available retrospective assessments of technology forecasts and recommends best practices for making such retrospective assessments. These best practices include making forecasts as specific as possible, including some measure of uncertainty in each forecast, and designing forecasts so they can be assessed retrospectively. I attempted to adhere to these best practices in the following two studies in this dissertation. The second chapter presents a pilot test of the proposed improved technology forecasting method that includes consideration of policy, economic, and social factors. A randomized controlled trial (n=133) was used to test the effectiveness of short briefings on reducing overconfidence in emerging automotive technology forecasts. The briefings warned participants to avoid overconfidence and encouraged them to think about how policy, economic, and social factors (such as government regulations, gasoline prices, and news coverage) may affect their forecasts. A retrospective assessment of the forecasts showed that the briefings reduced overconfidence in the forecasts. The third chapter is an application of the improved forecasting method to the future demand of power electronic applications in 2030 and which policy, economic, and social factors would be the most influential in determining that future demand. Fifteen experts were interviewed about the likely future demand of emerging power electronic applications (such as solar panels, transmission lines, and electric vehicles) with a focus on relevant policy, economic, and social factors (such as legislation, competitiveness, and public perception). The experts forecasted that electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, transmission, distribution, generation, ICT infrastructure, and the residential sector would have the highest future demand, approximately 2x-8x the demand today. The most influential policy, economic, and social factors on future demand were legislative action on climate change, the state of the global economy, sufficient resources, a reliable electric grid, public perception, and affordability",2023,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,14960877 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 14960877 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Public Policy; Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just like safety of food and water, the security of personal information should be pay attention by every person in case of malicious intention. The personal data information can be used to help medical institute and network company to optimize their research result and industrial structure. However, some sensitive personal data cannot be shared due to the human factors of untrusted parities. In this dissertation, I study privacy issues in data mining and provide a reputation system for wireless network with untrusted parities. Data mining with recent technical advances has become more important in Big Data Era. However, as the data continuously growing, people will care their privacy increasing more. So how to protect the privacy is the most important part when the data involving people's sensitive information such as genome sequence. The challenge in privacy-preserving data mining is avoiding the invasion of personal data privacy. Secure computation provides a solution to this problem. In this thesis, first I present a privacy-preserving method for training Restricted Boltzmann Machine. The method guarantees the privacy-protection in semi-honest model. Second, I design and analyze a symmetric-key based privacy-preserving scheme for mining support counts. Third, to protect data privacy in clustering, I study the method of privacy-preserving clustering using representatives over arbitrarily partitioned data. Fourth, I introduce Scorpio, a simple and convenient add-in for privacy preserving logrank test. Finally, I propose a incentive consideration to the study of secure computation by presenting a reputation system in wireless network.

This thesis applies research on vigilance, people’s ability to detect anomalies for a sustained period, to phishing risk. I (1) measure the human component of phishing susceptibility, (2) evaluate the validity of that measurement, and (3) demonstrate an approach for applying those measurements to risk analysis and evaluating behavioral interventions. I quantify human performance using signal detection theory (SDT) for a detection task (deciding whether a message is phishing) and a behavior task (deciding what to do about a message). As applied to phishing, SDT distinguishes between users’ ability to tell the difference between phishing and legitimate emails (called sensitivity, or d’) and bias toward identifying uncertain emails as phishing or legitimate (called response bias, or c). I find that users do not sufficiently compensate for their limited detection ability when choosing behaviors, despite incorporating confidence in their ability and their assessment of the consequences of errors into their decisions. I find similar results in an initial convenience (mTurk) sample and a community sample (enrolled in the Security Behavior Observatory (SBO) study). I find weak evidence for external validity of these tasks, given no relationship between performance in the experiment and negative computer security outcomes in real life (e.g. visits to malicious URLs or presence of malicious files). These results prompt discussion of the challenges of comparing behavior in laboratory and complex real-world settings. Lastly, I create an analytic model for evaluating anti-phishing behavioral interventions in the face of random and spear phishing attacks. Our results suggest the value of focusing on more susceptible users, particularly when defending against random attacks. This recommendation applies even when the ability to identify poor detectors is imperfect. Overall, this thesis bridges the vigilance and computer security literature to improve measurement of phishing susceptibility and show the value of assessing behavioral interventions in terms of signal detection theory.",8/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6724199.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis focuses on waste associated with product expiration since this type of waste involves both manufacturers and retailers as well as different functional areas such as production, warehousing, sales, procurement, and store operations. As a result, the industry has not made much progress in reducing this type of waste. We study three problems related to product expiration. Chapter 2 presents a descriptive study examining the root causes of product expiration and their impact on expiration. Using econometrics and our collaborator's data, we find that the amount of expiration can be reduced considerably via a case size reduction. We identify the next important opportunities in the areas of inventory aging in the manufacturer's supply chain and sales incentives, and thus the remainder of this thesis focuses on these two areas. Chapter 3 examines the manufacturer's sell-or-dispose decision for aged inventory. We develop an optimization model to find the minimum remaining shelf life below which the manufacturer does not sell the product since the cost of expiration is more than the sunk cost of production. We use machine learning to approximate optimum values which can be used as a low cost alternative method. If supply chain managers are held accountable for the cost of disposed items, they will have an incentive to better manage inventory. As a result, expiration will be reduced. Chapter 4 analyses sales-force compensation schemes from the perspective of product expiration caused by overselling. We develop a game theoretic model of the decision process of the manufacturer and the sales representative. We find a compensation scheme that aligns the interests of the manufacturer and the sales representative preventing overselling while achieving full profit potential for the manufacturer.",2015,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: Strategies to reduce product waste in the consumer packaged goods industry,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data at the core of the so-called ""big data"" revolution is fundamentally high-dimensional. We show implications of high-dimensionality as paradigmatic to modern disclosure analysis. Consequently, we propose and analyze a methodological framework that couples information-theoretic concepts from t-closeness and [delta]-disclosure with the partial adversarial knowledge model introduced by unicity [1] [2], as well as its possible extensions. The various methodologies were applied and compared on a large dataset of mobile phone records (CDRs), where results empirically showed ordinal equivalence among unicity measures and information distance measures EM-disclosure and KL-disclosure. Advantages of the proposed framework are highlighted, and future research avenues identified. We also investigate the tradeoff between data privacy and data usefulness related to mobile phone metadata (CDRs) and its real-world applications. On the disclosure side, four spatio-temporal points were enough to identify uniquely +95% of individuals, at a [ZIP code, 1 hour] spatiotemporal granularity - consistent with main results in the literature. As the dataset was coarsened in space and time, the ratio (unicity) decreased to values below 0.2% for data specified at [District, 1 week] granularity or lower. We confirmed the existence of a utility-privacy tradeoff for the 10 experts surveyed for this study, i.e., a positive relationship between reidentification risk and data utility. However, Pareto analysis revealed that several granularity levels (generalization profiles) are Pareto-suboptimal, thus the tradeoff is not strict. Non-strictness implies that not all privacy gains entail utility loss, and conversely, not all utility gains entail privacy loss. Results thus suggest that data policy decisions should rest on an understanding of the underlying privacy-utility tradeoff, as inefficient policies can otherwise be implemented, unnecessarily incurring in privacy or utility losses. Lastly we show that, due to ordinal equivalence tested on the CDR dataset, Pareto properties are preserved and thus these results on the utility-privacy tradeoff are invariant to assessing disclosure by information distance measures such as EM-disclosure and KL-disclosure. This work contributes to shed light on the privacy and utility tradeoff inherent to high-dimensional datasets of large societal systems. Its results and methodology are relevant for actors in both academic and policy domains, and germane as society engages in debate over technological and legal frameworks for potentially ubiquitous data generation and use.",2015,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,Balancing utility and privacy of high-dimensional datasets,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Balancing utility and privacy of high-dimensional datasets : mobile phone metadata,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both sectors also contribute to poor local and regional air quality. This thesis analyzes three interventions aimed at reducing air emissions from airplanes and ships. The first is the use of tugs, or an electric motor embedded in the landing gear, to propel the aircraft on the ground. If airlines were to tow all large narrowbody aircraft on domestic service from the gate to the edge of the runway before take off at 41 of the 50 busiest airports in the U.S., CO2 emissions would fall by 0.5 million tonnes annually. In addition, the switch would produce $150 million in annual air quality benefits from reduced emissions of particulate matter, hydrocarbons and the oxides of nitrogen. Using embedded electric motors to taxi large narrowbody aircraft would cut CO2 emissions by nearly 2 million tonnes per year. The second intervention is the market based mechanism, designed to cap CO2 emissions from international aviation at 2020 levels, currently being designed at ICAO. An analysis of an early draft of this mechanism suggests that it would require airlines to offset an average of 270 million tonnes in CO2 emissions during each of the years between 2021 and 2035 when it will be active. The analysis suggests that the current proposal is complex, and poorly specified. We recommend that the mechanism be made much simpler: for example, by simply determining an airline’s offset obligations on the basis of its carbon footprint in that year. Finally, we study the costs and benefits of a more widespread use of grid electricity to energize berthed vessels. We use mixed-integer linear programming to identify combinations of ports and vessels where using shore power would produce the greatest benefit to society. We conclude that the practice could reduce CO2 emissions by 0.2 million tonnes per year and yield air quality improvements worth $80-200 million per year at no net cost to society.",5/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721283.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73YIR8CA,thesis,2011,"Budhram, Stanley Chandra",An Economic Evaluation Comparing Stroke Telemedicine to Conventional Stroke Medicine,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/909949690?pq-origsite=primo,"Stroke is not only a serious medical problem, but it also poses an enormous economic burden on society. Stroke ranks the third as the leading cause of death in the United States behind heart disease and cancer. The survivors of stroke suffer from various degrees of long-term disability which create a severe financial burden on society. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) provides some of the best stroke treatment in the United States, but containing costs of conventional care without compromising access and quality of care remains a challenge. A telemedicine network between UPMC Stroke Institute (hub) and selected regional hospitals (spokes) was established to address the challenge. This cost-benefits study presents comparing telestroke treatment plan with that of conventional stroke to determine the viability of the telestroke approach. The economic evaluation was designed to inform the decision on whether or not to continue with the telestroke treatment of patients with blocked arteries from acute ischemic stroke. The group of patients selected for telestroke was treated via teleconsultation, whereas the conventional care group was treated at the stroke center. Both groups were evaluated by the same team of neurologists and received similar treatment, during the same period. Functional outcomes were obtained prospectively and were measured using the modified Rankin Scale. A Markov decision analytic model employing the Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine the cost-benefits (incremental net monetary benefits) of the two healthcare strategies. The model was constructed by using data obtained from UPMC, Pennsylvania Cost Containment Council, The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program, and the medical literature. The data was entered into the TreeAge Pro software package version 2011(TreeAge Pro Inc. of Williamstown, MA, USA), for modeling. The data was synthesized, processed, and output presented in text, numeric, and graphical form. The results showed that the telestroke treatment cost $14,336 less than that of conventional stroke. Although telestroke was found to be more effective than conventional care, the difference was not significant. Telestroke showed an incremental net monetary benefit over conventional care by $20,387 when the willingness to pay (WTP) value was set at $86,461. The WTP was based on the statistical value of life established by the EPA as $6.9 million, and an average life expectancy of 78 years. Telestroke is a viable alternative to conventional care for treating acute ischemic stroke with IVtPA, if the treatment is accomplished within three hours of the initial onset of stroke, and when a vascular neurologist is not readily available at the spoke site.

For doing so Styling Level and Technology Readiness were identified as independent variables, whereas Styling Iterations and Styling Iterations Time were designated as the dependent variables. In this case, the tools used to confirm correlation among variables were simple and multiple linear regressions. As it will be further detailed, Styling Iterations Time had the highest response to Technology Readiness while the rest of variables had no significant correlation on time duration for Studio and Engineering design activities. Based on hypothesis results and using OPM hierarchical decomposition, relations between processes and objects were analyzed at a given design state in order to evaluate complete matching relying on bipartite graphs and Hall's Marriage theorem. In addition, it was outlined how to identify delayed processes that fail to coexist due to a low technology readiness at a given design state using the Four-Colour theorem and elaborating about the application of chromatic number and polynomials to the OPM system's architecture. The system of interest was the headlamps system developed under Ford Global Product Development System (GPDS) using the Global Exterior Lighting Plan (PDP).",2014,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,Impact of technology readiness in the development of automotive systems when incorporating new styling,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, System Design and Management Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis SD&M 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Impact of technology readiness in the development of automotive systems when incorporating new styling : a graph theory approach to OPM hierarchical decomposition of the system's architecture,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; System Design and Management Program; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
759ASEZK,thesis,2015,"Perlman, David; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Future vehicle types and characteristics: reducing fuel consumption through shifts in vehicle segments and operating characteristics,,,,,,"Light duty vehicles represent a notable target of regulation in the United States due to their environmental, safety, and economic externalities. Fuel economy regulation represents one of the more prominent attempts to limit the environmental externalities of passenger vehicles entering the U.S. fleet, but focus intently on technology improvements rather than encouraging the sale of more fuel-efficient vehicle segments. More precisely, the current fuel economy standards, which will be phased in between 2012 and 2025, reflect an approach that is explicitly intended to be neutral with regard to the size and types of vehicles sold, with the stringency of the standard scaled to vehicle footprint, or the area between the four wheels. In light of this size-neutral approach to fuel economy regulation, as well as a lack of precedent in the automotive literature, the author examined the extent to which shifts in demand for different light duty vehicle segments can impact fleet-wide LDV fuel demand. Shifts in the demand for LDV segments have occurred in recent decades, with the market share of conventional passenger cars decreasing from more than 80 percent in the early 1980s to just over half today, replaced largely by sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and crossover utility vehicles (CUVs). Though many factors influenced this transition away from conventional passenger cars, available literature suggests that misalignment between fuel economy policy and prevailing market conditions, combined with some protectionist tax policies for the domestic auto industry, were the main culprits. Moreover, a fleet model analysis suggests that the impact in terms of fleet-wide fuel consumption was not trivial, with vehicles sold between 1985 and 2010 consuming, over their entire useful life, over 100 billion gallons of petroleum more than if 1985 LDV market segments have prevailed over that period. This historical analysis provided motivation and justification for exploring the potential for shifts between segments in the LDV market to influence LDV petroleum demand over the next several decades, in order to illustrate the potential missed opportunities of implementing fuel economy regulations that do not encourage the sale of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicle segments. Using a spreadsheet-based accounting model of the vehicle fleet, the author's analysis suggests that plausible shifts in the market shares of different LDV segments could increase or decrease LDV petroleum demand by up to seven percent, relative to a reference case provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (which, in itself, suggests a modest decrease in the demand for SUVs and CUVs through 2040). The author also explored the potential of a more radical -yet still plausible - change to LDVs to impact fleet-wide fuel consumption over the next few decades. Automating passenger vehicle controls has long been imagined by futurists and tested in various forms by automotive manufacturers since the 1950s, but recent developments stemming from a series of competitions sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency between 2007 and 2011 suggest that increasingly automated vehicle features may soon become a production reality. Though intended primarily as a means of improving safety, automated vehicle systems have the potential to also decrease fuel consumption. Also using the fleet model, the author evaluated the potential of a highway-only partial automation system - akin to systems reportedly being introduced to the market by General Motors and Tesla, among others, within the next two years - to reduce fleetwide LDV fuel consumption. Results suggest that, depending on a wide range of variables, reductions in fleet-wide fuel consumption of up to two percent are possible by 2050 relative to the Energy Information Administration reference case. Though the results of the analysis explored in this thesis may seem modest, they are notable nonetheless. Most importantly, they represent reductions in fuel consumption that are possible to achieve in addition to those likely to be driven by current fuel economy regulations. Therefore, the changes to passenger vehicles explored in this thesis represent potential strategies for reducing LDV fuel consumption as manufacturers reach the limits of technological improvements to engines.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Future vehicle types and characteristics,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Future vehicle types and characteristics : reducing fuel consumption through shifts in vehicle segments and operating characteristics,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore this, I start by assessing the potential of using large-scale infrastructure networks as social sensors to detect aspects of inequity to better inform investment policy. I focus my exploration on broadband infrastructure to begin with, exploring the possibility of using U.S. county-level broadband penetration rates as a social sensor to predict rates of unemployment amidst the COVID-19 pandemic (Chapter 2). This work specifically asks, “How can infrastructure serve as a social sensor that allows for sharper detection of those groups which are most vulnerable to disruption?”. I find that broadband can serve as an effective social sensor which is sharpened when applied to employment contexts relevant to broadband, but, as with any sensor, is prone to error (either false positives or false negatives). I then shift my interest from the macro-system to a more micro-focused approach of how to incorporate preferences from end-users into the investment process. To do this, I develop an innovative approach to incorporating qualitative interview responses into a multi-criteria decision-making process (Chapter 3). I find that hauled system water users in Alaska have a strong preference for the aesthetic properties of their water provision which they balance against the need for reliable water system delivery. I end my investigation by understanding the role that skills play as a sensor for detecting effective and equitable use of infrastructure. To do this, I explore broadband connectivity throughout Rwanda and its impact on a critical aspect of development, public health (Chapter 4). To explore this question, I ask to what degree are wireless biomedical devices (specifically EKGs) available and used in the public hospital system in Rwanda? And what impact does broadband access have on the kinds of services which are offered? I find that the first tier of the digital divide influences the ability of offer telehealth services and propose additional future work on the compounded impacts of this access on both second and their tier access.",5/24/24,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:44,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/25800007.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Commonwealth's academic and industrial institutions produce a consistent stream of cutting-edge scientific research and the region has a well-developed professional and financial infrastructure to support the translation of these ideas into useful products. Venture capital (VC) plays a particularly important role in this ecosystem. VC funding is essential to most life sciences companies due to their high research and development costs and long time to market. The economic downturn of 2008 led to a rapid and significant contraction in the ability of venture capital firms to raise the funding that supports their work. We use this setting to test the impact of a funding shock on life sciences focused venture capital resource allocation. Specifically we looked at the rate and direction of funding choices made by venture capitalists before and after the downturn. We analyzed data on yearly venture capital fundraising and 22,345 observations of investment dyads between venture capital firms and the portfolio companies which they invested in from the ten year period beginning in the year 2000. Additionally, seventy-six interviews with stakeholders in the Massachusetts life sciences community were conducted to help us understand the actual impact of data trends. This resulted in four major findings: (1) Although all venture capital fundraising was hindered in 2008 and 2009, life sciences focused venture funds were impacted disproportionately lightly in 2008 and disproportionately severely in 2009. (2) There has been a decline in the mean level of venture capital funding that companies are receiving. (3) The rate of new company formation is slowing as the rate of reinvestment in existing companies increases. (4) Innovation is being negatively impacted as fewer new companies translate technology into useful products and existing companies scale back their research and development pipelines.",2010,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,"Technological innovation, venture formation and resource allocation",,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,"Book Title: Technological innovation, venture formation and resource allocation : the impact of economic downturn on life sciences venture capital and start-ups",,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78EB6NHN,thesis,2014,"Jenkins, Jesse D.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program","Economic regulation of electricity distribution utilities under high penetration of distributed energy resources: applying an incentive compatible menu of contracts, reference network model and uncertainty mechanisms",,,,,,"Ongoing changes in the use and management of electricity distribution systems - including the proliferation of distributed energy resources, smart grid technologies (i.e., advanced power electronics and information and communication technologies) and active system management techniques - present new challenges for the economic regulation of electricity distribution utilities. In particular, regulators are likely to face increased uncertainty regarding the evolution of network uses and the efficient cost of network investments and maintenance, as well as an increased informational disadvantage vis-a-vis the regulated utility. These challenges are especially important for regulatory approaches that establish some share of the utility's allowed revenues ex ante (e.g., incentive regulation, also known as revenue or price cap regulation, RPI-X, performance-based regulation, or output-based regulation). This thesis proposes a novel process for establishing the allowed revenues of an electricity distribution utility and demonstrates its application as a practical solution to the imminent regulatory challenges discussed above. The proposed method is a new combination of three established regulatory tools: an engineering-based reference network model (RNM) for forward-looking benchmarking of efficient network expenditures; an incentive compatible menu of contracts to elicit accurate forecasts from the utility and create incentives for cost saving efficiency efforts; and ex post automatic adjustment mechanisms, or ""delta factors,"" to accommodate uncertainty in the evolution of network use and minimize forecast error. Chapter 1 reviews the theoretical economic foundations of the regulation of network monopolies, identifies emerging challenges in the regulation of electricity distribution companies, and introduces the proposed regulatory method. Chapter 2 describes the simulation of a realistic, large-scale urban distribution network used to demonstrate the novel regulatory process proposed in this thesis. Chapter 3 uses the simulated distribution network to demonstrate, step-by-step, the practical implementation of the novel regulatory process, evaluates its performance, and summarizes the advantages for the economic regulation of electricity distribution utilities under increasing penetration of distributed energy resources.",2014,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Economic regulation of electricity distribution utilities under high penetration of distributed energy resources,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,"Book Title: Economic regulation of electricity distribution utilities under high penetration of distributed energy resources : applying an incentive compatible menu of contracts, reference network model and uncertainty mechanisms",,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Information gleaned from secondary research will be analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Thematic analysis is a research approach that provides a framework for identifying relevant resources and outcome information, comparing and contrasting these sources of information, and reporting on themes discovered within this extant literature.

7DWMG7LK,thesis,2015,"Czaika, Ellen Gail; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Model use in sustainability negotiations and decisions,,,,,,"Sustainability negotiations and decisions require the integration of scientific information with stakeholder interests. Mathematical models help elucidate the physical world and therefore may orient the negotiators in a shared understanding of the physical world. Many researchers suggest collaborative modeling to facilitate integrating scientific information and stakeholder interests. In this thesis, I use methods that enable repeated instances of the same decision; the exploration of alternatives to model use (e.g. learning of a model's logic, relevant information, or irrelevant information); and the exploration of alternatives to collaborative modeling (e.g. using an expert model or not using a model). This thesis comprises two studies that use serious game role-play simulations. The first study is a computer-driven role-play simulation of governmental policy creation and the second is a five-party role-play simulation to negotiate a more sustainable end-of-life for used paper coffee cups. In the first study, model users reached the Pareto Frontier-the set of non-dominated points-more readily (13%) than non-model-users (2.5%) and model users discovered the win-win nature of electricity access with higher frequency (63%) than non-model users (9%). Participants who learned of the model's logic through presentation performed nearly as well as model users. In the second study, model use shortened the (mean) duration of the negotiation from 55 minutes to 45 minutes. Negotiating tables that co-created a model had a higher likelihood of reaching favorable agreements (44% compared to 25%). Model use did not significantly alter the value distribution among parties. Tables of negotiators used the model in two predominant manners: to test alternatives as they generated potential agreements and to verify a tentative agreement. The former resulted in higher mean table values than the latter. Together, these studies demonstrate: that mathematical models can be used in sustainability negotiations and decisions with good effect; that learning about the insights of a model is beneficial in decision making-but using a model is more beneficial; and that collaborative model building can provide better negotiation outcomes than using an expert model and can be faster than not using a model.",2015,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: Model use in sustainability negotiations and decisions,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7FC3ZJSY,thesis,2015,"Zoepf, Stephen M.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management","Plug-in vehicles and carsharing: user preferences, energy consumption and potential for growth",,,,,,"Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) are seen as a key pathway to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in transportation, yet their sales are under 1% of new cars despite large incentives. Carsharing, a market where consumers rent vehicles for short durations, is a low-risk way for consumers to use Plug-In Electric Vehicles for their travel needs without a large financial commitment. However, deployment of PEVs in carsharing depends on three key factors: (1) consumer acceptance of PEVs for rental trips, (2) the ability of carsharing providers to manage technical limitations of PEVs, and (3) that real-world energy consumption of PEVs meets expectations. To explore the feasibility of PEV deployment in carsharing, this dissertation incorporates a Mixed-Integer Programming and simulation of the assignment of trips and vehicles, and a Hybrid Choice Model of carsharing user preferences. This dissertation's primary contributions consist of the combination of Hybrid Choice Models with a Structural Topic Model to incorporate respondent comments, a two-level representation of the assignment problem faced by carsharing providers in allocating trips to vehicles and locating vehicles, a case study of PEV deployment in Boston, and analysis of real-world energy consumption of two fleets of PEVs. Results suggest that a large fraction of round-trip carsharing fleets could be converted to PEVs, simultaneously increasing profitability and reducing gasoline consumption, and some benefits can be captured using simple heuristics. However, current user attitudes towards PEVs in carsharing vary widely, and while carsharing exposes many users to hybrids, few have tried PEVs.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Plug-in vehicles and carsharing,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology, Management, and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 Ph.D.,"Book Title: Plug-in vehicles and carsharing : user preferences, energy consumption and potential for growth",,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7FDWT24K,thesis,2022,"Morris, Jack; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Retrofit solutions to electric power sector decarbonization in the American Midwest,,,,,,"Electric power system decarbonization requires phasing out existing, carbon-emitting power plants and replacing them with new, clean generation and transmission capacity. This transition presents simultaneous challenges in investment and operational costs and system reliability. In hopes of saving costs, ensuring reliability, and preserving the power plant workforce, interest has risen among states and utilities in the potential of power plant retrofits. By reusing existing equipment and infrastructure in aging coal and natural gas power plants, utilities can save costs on new greenfield developments. Several developing technologies well-equipped to reuse all or part of the facilities at these thermal power plants include firm, low-carbon power plants and long-duration storage facilities. These technologies help balance load in a high renewables grid while employing much of the same power plant workforce. A study of retrofit options is particularly important for the American Midwest where coal makes up a large portion of the resource mix and where the potential for intermittent wind deployment is high. This thesis enables retrofit modeling in a multi-stage capacity expansion framework and uses it to evaluate the potential for retrofits to lower system costs and cumulative emissions over three modeled carbon reduction pathways from 2020 to 2040 in the Midwest and surrounding areas. Although resulting reductions in cost and emissions are modest, we observe notable system-level reductions in curtailment of renewable generation, transmission expansion, and new natural gas deployment as well as distributional impacts relating to the costs of transitioning to a low-carbon electric power system.",2022,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Retrofit solutions to electric power sector decarbonization in the American Midwest,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7FGDAAF8,thesis,2015,"Collins, Ross D.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Using inclusive wealth as a measure of sustainability for infrastructure planning and evaluation,,,,,,"Inclusive wealth (IW) measures the productive base of an economy, which is a linear index of its capital asset stocks. Changes to IW per capita over time track changes to intergenerational human well-being, thus non-declining IW per capita indicates sustainable development. National IW has only been measured retrospectively; this dissertation models and projects IW prospectively, measuring the impact of alternative infrastructure plans on IW. The focus of the work is on electricity planning in oil-exporting countries. Domestic oil consumption in these countries, driven by increasing electricity use, threatens long-term development by reducing the export revenue on which the government and economy depends. First, I develop a system dynamics model that connects electric power capacity expansion with macroeconomic development, tabulating both infrastructure costs and impacts to the capital stocks of IW over time. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is the primary case study. Second, I analyze the capital stock projections generated by the model across a range of scenarios and countries. Under the baseline IW formulation, KSA experiences a negative annual growth rate to inclusive wealth per capita to 2050. However, adjusted formulations allow the possibility of periods of positive growth, and a non-oil sector that is less dependent on the oil sector will shift the IW trajectory upwards. Compared to KSA, Kuwait is likely to experience larger per capita declines in IW. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), on the other hand, will potentially experience positive growth rates in per capita IW starting in 2028. Third, I analyze the IW impacts of non-fossil investments in electricity infrastructure, specifically nuclear and solar, between now and 2050. In KSA, the produced capital benefits of non-fossil investment outweigh the oil capital costs (to finance the infrastructure) across a range of uncertainties. Including human capital benefits raises net benefits by an order of magnitude. The optimal allocation of nuclear and solar power ultimately depends on the evaluation metric used. The UAE gains least from non-fossil investment, since it uses comparatively less oil in its electricity system, while Kuwait experiences gains similar to KSA. Importantly, using IW as the basis for electricity policy evaluation yields qualitatively different prescriptions than a least-cost capacity expansion model.",2015,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: Using inclusive wealth as a measure of sustainability for infrastructure planning and evaluation,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As more hospitals adopt EHR, focus has shifted to how these records can be used to improve patient care. One barrier to this improvement is limited information exchange between providers. In this work I examine the role of EHR vendors, hypothesizing that vendors strategically control the exchange of clinicalhospital exchanging clinical summaries with hospitals outside its health system increases as the percentage ofhospitals with the same EHR vendor in the region increases. When reviewing the relationship of vendor market concentration at the state level I find a positive significantrelationship with the percentage of hospitals that share clinical care summaries within a state. However, I find no significant impact from state policies designed to incentivizeinformation exchange through the State Health Information Exchange Cooperative Program. In order to avoid closed networks that foreclose some hospitals, it is importantthat future regulation attempt to be more inclusive of hospitals that do not use large vendors and are therefore unable to use proprietary methods for exchange.Chapter 3 explores the mental models of patients and how it may affect the implementation of tools to enhance adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART). Highlevels of adherence to ART are necessary to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant HIV virus and delay disease progression. For this reason, a number of interventionshave been designed to support adherence for people living with HIV (PLWH). However, widely used adherence interventions, though successful for some populations, still fail certain vulnerable groups. The mental model approach allows us to go beyond current decision-making models to understand context specific aspects of behavior mostrelevant to this group. I interview nine high-risk non-adherents and compare their mental models to non-adherence models as seen by experts. In this study I identified how scarcity conditions and the several ways in which adhering to ARVs induces negative affect can influence the cost-benefit analysis that decision makers engage in when deciding to take their medication. Further work needs to be done to understand theprevalence of this decision-making biases in order to design more inclusive interventions. Chapter 4 explores the use of future self interventions (FSI) and the possibleunintended consequences of their use in health decision making due to negative perceptions of aging. Many leading causes of mortality and morbidity in developedcountries stem from health risk factors that are influenced by individual choices. Improving decision makers’ understanding of how benefits will accrue to themselves inthe future could inform health choices over their lifespan. However, negative attitudes toward aging related to the view of declining health or illness during this period could beuniquely relevant when the decision maker determines the utility of future health. The goal of this study is to examine how the relationships between future self connectiongenerated by FSI along with expectations of aging and aging anxiety influence the anticipated valuation of future health. Participants between the ages of 18 and 45 wererecruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. They were then assigned to participate in one of three groups of letter-writing exercises, a control, one to the self 20 years in the futureand another to the 68-year-old version of the self. Our results suggest that a connection with the future aged self interacts with aging anxiety in ways that decrease the value adecision maker assesses to future quality of life. As we expected, we found that a positive effect of expectations regarding aging, however, this effect is lower for those inthe intervention group who were tasked with writing a letter to a far-off future self. Furthermore, we find that anticipated health utility has a negative effect on the healthdiscount rate. This study provides evidence that there are unique characteristics of aging that may impact future health valuation which should be considered before usingFSI to incentivize future oriented health behavior.",9/24/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7212443.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response, these households rely on fossil fuel-based technologies to meet their household needs. Families without grid access rely on kerosene lamps predominantlyto meet lighting needs, while grid-connected homes use fossil fuel backup generators. Studies of fossil fuel solutions like kerosene lamps and backup generators show that these technologies impose negative socio-economic impacts on both households and society. As a result, researchers and policymakers have been motivated to explore cleaner and more sustainable technologies like residential solar electric with battery storage systems. This thesis through aquantitative investigation of residential solar systems to analyzes the technical, economic, and environmental merits of residential solar systems in their applicability to address key electricity challenges facing sub-Saharan households.For households in rural areas without access in Kenya, solar home systems provide a cost effective alternative to kerosene lamps as a better lighting alternative, and even better for household economics when the additional services are considered like phone charging. I found was price elasticity of demand to be the key determinant of economic attractiveness for lighting services, which attempts to quantify the value households place on improved lightingservice. For grid connected households, findings suggest that residential solar with battery storage electric systems can provide improved household electricity reliability while reducing reliance on backup generators. However, these systems increase grid demand. The main driver of theeconomic attractiveness of these systems are the household’s reliability needs which is reflectedin how many hours the household’s backup generators is available for dispatch in the event of a grid outage as well as discount rate. The study finds that grid availability is also a key determinant of the economic attractiveness of these residential systems, because the quality of grid service in terms of how many hours the grid provides power to the household determines the overall level of backup generator reliance.",10/18/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:35,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/9964253.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/NQWTPWM4/Udeani - 2019 - Improving Electricity Access and Reliability using Residential Solar Systems with Battery Storage Sy.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7JVMSSZH,thesis,2010,"Zhang, Na; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Apply option-thinking in long term infrastructure investment: the case of commercial real estate,,,,,,"Over the last two decades the application of real options theory has dramatically altered the way researches model infrastructure investment decisions. Real options are the right, but not obligation to do something for a certain cost within or at a specific period of time. Compared to the rich literature, its implementation in practice is however limited. This thesis identifies a common but ignored problem of the option valuation methodology. While trends and volatilities of market-based uncertainties are fundamental inputs for options valuation, they are in many cases difficult to get reliable estimates due to the changing patterns of the uncertainty factors. Current research on option valuation typically extracts estimates from data of a certain period (such as 10 years) without verifying the chosen period is superior to others. This thesis demonstrates this problem by analyzing the prices indices of underlying assets in real estate markets of U.S. and Singapore; and then shows how to adjust the flexibility design and valuation in long-term infrastructure development to capture the value of embedded options. Since uncertainty is the key driver of option value, the study of uncertainty itself should always be at the core of flexibility design. An in-depth study of (a) both the feature/nature of each uncertainty (b) and interactions among different uncertainties, inside and outside of the project/investment is essential and extremely important to give rise to attractive real options. This thesis looks at a sub-part of long-term infrastructure development - commercial real estate - which is usually high-rise building existing in a highly volatile market. An option-thinking approach is proposed to guide flexibility design, both inactive and proactive flexibility. Proactive flexibility gives rise to an infrastructure design that makes sense for both now and the future. This happens when the design use uncertainties, not the requirements from the user meeting, as one of the primary drivers of the design. The approach involves three aspects: financial, technical and political. Particularly, the political aspect indicates that developers should carefully form contracts with partners/customers as well as relevant authorities to make it possible to exercise the options in the future when desirable. This thesis uses a true case of mixed use commercial real estate development - Central in Singapore - to show the process of utilizing option-thinking in flexibility design and valuation.",2010,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,Apply option-thinking in long term infrastructure investment,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: Apply option-thinking in long term infrastructure investment : the case of commercial real estate,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this fact, almost no research has been done on their levels of disaster preparedness. In this dissertation, I use mixed quantitative and qualitative methods to explain variation in the levels of disaster preparedness among CBOs. My goal is to understand which organizational characteristics are highly correlated with disaster preparedness and which characteristics seem to have no effect on preparedness. By doing so, I hope to help CBOs—and therefore their clients—become better prepared for disasters. To complete my dissertation, I rely on data I helped gather while working as a Graduate Research Assistant on BayPrep, a joint research project of the University of Colorado Natural Hazards Center and the Fritz Institute. I utilize factor analysis to condense numerous measures of disaster preparedness into a manageable number of artificial dimensions known as factors. Then, I construct multivariate regression models that examine the effects of organizational characteristics on the previously generated disaster preparedness factors. Finally, I enrich and validate my quantitative results with the qualitative data I gathered while conducting in-depth interviews with the executives of the CBOs in this study. I conclude with a discussion of ways that my research can help CBOs become better prepared for natural disasters as well as important questions that my findings raise about the socio-economic structure of society.",2010,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,Surviving the next disaster,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Surviving the next disaster: Assessing the preparedness of community-based organizations ISBN: 9781109779660 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 6 Pages: 2235 Volume: 71,,,,,Colorado; Community organization; Disasters; Emergency management; Executives; Natural disasters; Organizational behavior; Social structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the interconnectedness of these systems there is a lack of empirical research documenting how these organizations work collectively - or integrate - and how this integration impacts enterprise performance measured through quality, efficiency, and access. In the case of psychological healthcare, patients often require a number of services that span multiple departments and programs within an enterprise, increasing the complexity of maintaining a continuum of care for these patients. This paper, which is part of a larger effort to examine psychological healthcare in the U.S. Military Health System, presents a series of qualitative observations and analyses of the integration of psychological health-related organizations at two large health enterprises within the military. These qualitative inquiries take a multilevel approach for examining integration within these enterprises and address the following areas of interest: 1) the mechanisms for integration; 2) the objects of integration; 3) the dimensions of integration; 4) the contextual factors that influence integration; and 5) the impacts of integration on enterprise performance. Using semi-structured interviews, qualitative data was collected and then examined using content analysis to identify the most frequent themes for each area of interest. This data was used to validate and refine a comprehensive framework for integration that was developed to pull together multiple, distinct strands of the integration literature. This data was also used to demonstrate the relationship between different dimensions of enterprise performance and to identify areas where, in the process of optimizing enterprise performance, there is a trade-off between these dimensions. The preliminary, qualitative results of this research are intended to provide a conceptual foundation and framework for future analytic studies.",2012,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,Integration and the performance of large-scale health enterprises,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2012 S.M.,Book Title: Integration and the performance of large-scale health enterprises : field studies of psychological health delivery systems in the U.S. Military,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, provisions of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) have led to smart grid investments in the United States. Smart grid upgrades have included the installation of new technologies at all levels of the electric power delivery system. At the distribution system level modernization has included upgrades to communication systems, distribution automation, local control and protection systems, and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). Chapter 2 of this thesis aims to use elements of the emerging smart grid at the distribution system level to alleviate the effects of a widespread and long-duration power blackout. Despite continuing efforts to make the electric grid robust, some risk remains of widespread and extended power outages caused by extreme weather, human error, or premeditated terrorist attack. Chapter 2 applies the concept of survivability to the case of ensuring the continued provision of a subset of socially critical services during such blackouts. A load cycling based methodology is proposed, and an associated economic analysis indicates that the cost of implementing the proposed scheme constitutes less than 1% of median annual household income for a range of assumed outage probabilities, distributed generation resource availabilities, and financing options. While the technical elements of proposed scheme are largely feasible, a few policy changes are identified as necessary for successful implementation of the scheme. The latter half of this thesis focuses on one potential security risk posed by the large-scale deployment of smart meters. Smart meters constitute one component of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), a key element of the smart grid. Chapter 3 describes a few documented smart meter hacking strategies and motivates the following question: What, if any, are the implications of smart meter hacking for the bulk power grid? To help answer this question Chapter 4 focuses on one specific attack type with the potential for causing widespread disruption to electric service – the cycling of a large number of consumer loads using the remote connect/disconnect switch on several smart meters. Results from simulations performed on two IEEE test networks (the 9 and 39-bus dynamic test cases) indicate that it is improbable that the mere toggling of customer loads could destabilize the bulk power grid because the fraction of system load that needs to be cycled to induce instability is likely to be prohibitively large.",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,The Emerging Smart Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723584.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis focuses on waste associated with product expiration since this type of waste involves both manufacturers and retailers as well as different functional areas such as production, warehousing, sales, procurement, and store operations. As a result, the industry has not made much progress in reducing this type of waste. We study three problems related to product expiration. Chapter 2 presents a descriptive study examining the root causes of product expiration and their impact on expiration. Using econometrics and our collaborator's data, we find that the amount of expiration can be reduced considerably via a case size reduction. We identify the next important opportunities in the areas of inventory aging in the manufacturer's supply chain and sales incentives, and thus the remainder of this thesis focuses on these two areas. Chapter 3 examines the manufacturer's sell-or-dispose decision for aged inventory. We develop an optimization model to find the minimum remaining shelf life below which the manufacturer does not sell the product since the cost of expiration is more than the sunk cost of production. We use machine learning to approximate optimum values which can be used as a low cost alternative method. If supply chain managers are held accountable for the cost of disposed items, they will have an incentive to better manage inventory. As a result, expiration will be reduced. Chapter 4 analyses sales-force compensation schemes from the perspective of product expiration caused by overselling. We develop a game theoretic model of the decision process of the manufacturer and the sales representative. We find a compensation scheme that aligns the interests of the manufacturer and the sales representative preventing overselling while achieving full profit potential for the manufacturer.",2015,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: Strategies to reduce product waste in the consumer packaged goods industry,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7VFAQ9IM,thesis,2015,"Macfarlane, Nicholas Blair Wootton; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Tagging wild cetaceans: investigating the balance between more and less invasive techniques,,,,,,"On-animal tags provide an incredible window into the world of cetaceans, allowing researchers to track movements across ocean basins and investigate fine-scale behavior deep below the surface. The earliest cetacean tags were Discovery marks developed by the British Colonial Office at the turn of the 20th century, and their influence continues to inform some of the implanted cetacean tags being deployed. Today, there are a wide variety of tags in use that can be broadly divided into two principal categories driven by the length of attachment required-disposable transmitting systems that are implanted in the animals and archival tags that must be recovered in order to collect the data. Archival tags typically use a non-invasive attachment with a release to get the data back. These tags provide essential information for conservation and management of these vulnerable species. In the United States, a broad suite of regulations protects cetaceans and other marine mammals. Welfare protection stems from the Animal Welfare Act and Conservation protection stems from the Marine Mammal Protection and Endangered Species Acts. To navigate this policy landscape, both regulators and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees need to weigh the benefits of a tagging study against the potential for serious harm and evaluate whether a proposed method is the least harmful way to answer a scientific question. However, the effects of tagging wild cetaceans are not well-understood and difficult to compare, leading to challenges for objectively assessing proposals. In this environment of uncertainty, specific guidelines from professional societies would be helpful, but varying institutional and individual approaches to the balance between conservation and welfare will make consensus difficult. Given this context, we ought to employ the precautionary principle when evaluating impacts, interpreting guidelines and implementing them.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Tagging wild cetaceans,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Tagging wild cetaceans : investigating the balance between more and less invasive techniques,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7VMZQXM4,thesis,2009,"Castillo, Andrea R.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Assessing computational methods and science policy in systems biology,,,,,,"In this thesis, I discuss the development of systems biology and issues in the progression of this science discipline. Traditional molecular biology has been driven by reductionism with the belief that breaking down a biological system into the fundamental biomolecular components will elucidate such phenomena. We have reached limitations with this approach due to the complex and dynamical nature of life and our inability to intuit biological behavior from a modular perspective [37]. Mathematical modeling has been integral to current system biology endeavors since detailed analysis would be invasive if performed on humans experimentally or in clinical trials [17]. The interspecies commonalities in systemic properties and molecular mechanisms suggests that certain behaviors transcend specie differentiation and therefore easily lend to generalizing from simpler organisms to more complex organisms such as humans [7, 17]. Current methodologies in mathematical modeling and analysis have been diverse and numerous, with no standardization to progress the discipline in a collaborative manner. Without collaboration during this formative period, successful development and application of systems biology for societal welfare may be at risk. Furthermore, such collaboration has to be standardized in a fundamental approach to discover generic principles, in the manner of preceding long-standing science disciplines. This study effectively implements and analyzes a mathematical model of a three-protein biochemical network, the Synechococcus elongatus circadian clock., (cont.) I use mass action theory expressed in kronecker products to exploit the ability to apply numerical methods-including sensitivity analysis via boundary value formulation (BVP) and trapiezoidal integration rule-and experimental techniques-including partial reaction fitting and enzyme-driven activations-when mathematically modeling large-scale biochemical networks. Amidst other applicable methodologies, my approach is grounded in the law of mass action because it is based in experimental data and biomolecular mechanistic properties, yet provides predictive power in the complete delineation of the biological system dynamics for all future time points. The results of my research demonstrate the holistic approach that mass action method-ologies have in determining emergent properties of biological systems. I further stress the necessity to enforce collaboration and standardization in future policymaking, with reconsiderations on current stakeholder incentive to redirect academia and industry focus from new molecular entities to interests in holistic understanding of the complexities and dynamics of life entities. Such redirection away from reductionism could further progress basic and applied scientific research to embetter our circumstances through new treatments and preventive measures for health, and development of new strains and disease control in agriculture and ecology [13].",2009,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2009 S.M.,Book Title: Assessing computational methods and science policy in systems biology,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For doing so Styling Level and Technology Readiness were identified as independent variables, whereas Styling Iterations and Styling Iterations Time were designated as the dependent variables. In this case, the tools used to confirm correlation among variables were simple and multiple linear regressions. As it will be further detailed, Styling Iterations Time had the highest response to Technology Readiness while the rest of variables had no significant correlation on time duration for Studio and Engineering design activities. Based on hypothesis results and using OPM hierarchical decomposition, relations between processes and objects were analyzed at a given design state in order to evaluate complete matching relying on bipartite graphs and Hall's Marriage theorem. In addition, it was outlined how to identify delayed processes that fail to coexist due to a low technology readiness at a given design state using the Four-Colour theorem and elaborating about the application of chromatic number and polynomials to the OPM system's architecture.

It is estimated that this will require investments of $40 trillion or $1.3 trillion per year in new and mature clean technologies. Currently, only about $0.3 trillion of investment goes to clean technology a year and the majority of that funding goes to mature, proven technologies. There is an investment gap in clean technologies, and the gap is especially pronounced for new and unproven technologies that are necessary to bring down costs of the entire system, and produce quicker breakthroughs in CO₂ mitigation. The gap is partly due to the large losses sustained by venture capitalists-one of the greatest source of early-stage capital-who invested heavily in clean technology companies in the years leading up to the 2008 recession. After the market crashed, federal and state governments ended up being among the few remaining supporters of these technology companies because of their public benefits. However, in order to stay below 2 degree Celsius warming, venture capitalists and other private venture investors must be engaged to invest in the clean technology sector again. Public sector funds are not sufficient. In a sector that has produced few winners while receiving substantial government support, the challenge could not be greater. To address this challenge, we ask three questions of three key actors: How can entrepreneurs attract private investment and scale up pass the Valley of Death? How can venture capitalists build the ability and confidence to invest in the cleantech sector again? How can policymakers address the failure modes that may still exist if investors and entrepreneurs follow best practices? To explore this issue, we conducted interviews, reviewed literature, compiled data from online sources, and compiled information from conferences and workshops. Our findings reveal a ""Cleantech Confluence"", or a preliminary set of best practices and partnerships.

835H6CUW,thesis,2014,"Dwyer, Morgan Maeve; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",The cost of Jointness: insights from environmental monitoring systems in low Earth orbit,,,,,,"The term jointness refers to activities or operations that are executed collaboratively by more than one government agency or military department. While joint operations have become increasingly common and successful, the government continues to struggle with joint system acquisition: in fact, although a common motivation for joint acquisition is cost savings, recent studies suggest that joint programs experience larger cost growth than non-joint programs and that it may be more cost effective for agencies to acquire systems independently rather than jointly. This thesis explains why joint programs often experience large cost growth and how jointness itself may induce it. To understand the cost of jointness, this thesis proposes and demonstrates a new approach for studying large, complex acquisition programs whereby the evolution of a program's organizational and technical architectures is quantified and observed using a design structure matrix (DSM)-based tool. Using this approach, one is able to gain an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive a program's costs, as well as global perspective on cost growth throughout a program's lifecycle. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to study the cost impacts of jointness on three programs that developed environmental monitoring systems for low Earth orbit. The acquisition community's current understanding of joint programs suggests that jointness induces cost growth by increasing a program's organizational and technical complexity. However, using the DSM-based tool, this thesis demonstrates that complexity is a dynamic property of an acquisition program that is driven by government agencies' institutional interests and the actions that they motivate. Specifically, the thesis presents a more nuanced understanding of jointness, complexity, and cost growth by arguing that government agencies' institutional interest in retaining or regaining autonomy motivates actions that alter the agencies' relationships with one another, with the joint organization, and with the system under development. When agencies take action to retain or to regain autonomy, they increase the complexity of the joint organization or the joint system and the program's costs grow as result. Finally, the thesis discusses the implications of the proposed Agency Action Model both generally and specifically in the context of environmental monitoring programs. Aided by a trade space analysis tool that was developed to explore a broad set of concepts for future environmental monitoring systems, the thesis demonstrates how government leaders should approach the problem of joint program formulation and in doing so, generates a set a policy recommendations for future partnerships between the agencies that have historically collected environmental data from low Earth orbit.",2014,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,The cost of Jointness,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology, Management, and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: The cost of Jointness : insights from environmental monitoring systems in low Earth orbit,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Federal mandates require increasing ethanol use in the transportation sector. Meeting the mandates could mean increasing the blend in conventional gasoline, or increasing the use of E85 in FFVs. This dissertation explores the economic, environmental and policy effects from producing ethanol from natural gas, and generally expanding access to ethanol as a transportation fuel (feedstock agnostic). Three processes are considered for producing ethanol from natural gas: (1) autothermal reforming (ATR) with catalytic conversion, (2) TCX, a process that produces intermediate products of methanol and acetic acid, developed by Celanese Corp., and (3) a fermentation process developed by Coskata Inc. I first estimate the cost of producing ethanol from natural gas to power light-duty FFVs in Pennsylvania (PA). Relying on production cost estimates provided by developers and assuming recent natural gas and gasoline prices are good proxies for future prices, I conclude that the cost of producing ethanol with either the Coskata or ATR processes would more likely than not be cheaper than gasoline and corn-based ethanol. However, capital costs from these emerging processes and future natural gas and gasoline prices are highly uncertain. The NGLF ethanol must also have acceptable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, for which an estimate is not currently available in the literature. I find the average life cycle GHG emissions for a 100-yr global warming potential (GWP) are 137 g CO2-eqiuv/MJ (ATR Catalytic), 119 g CO2-eqiuv/MJ (Celanese TCX) and 156 g CO2-eqiuv/MJ (Coskata fermentation), given the uncertainty in some parameters the estimate could be slightly higher or lower. All processes have life cycle emissions well above gasoline, and the 20% reduction from gasoline required by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2). Even in the unlikely scenario of zero emissions from the upstream processes, NGLF ethanol process and combustion emissions are still larger than gasoline, although with more overlap in the error bars. More detailed life cycle assessments with process modeling could refine the emissions estimates. Existing policies incentivize ethanol produced from renewable sources, but no current policy provisions specifically incentivize the use or production of ethanol produced from natural gas. I conclude the dissertation with estimates of additional refueling costs for an FFV driver and infrastructure costs for expanding E85 access in Pennsylvania. The state recently received government grants for biofuels infrastructure. I find that even with a subsidy to cover average infrastructure costs of $0.03 to $1.48 per gasoline gallon equivalent (gge) for the retailer, the consumer would still incur additional costs for refueling more often with E85. A refueling cost subsidy of $3.60/gge to cover the additional costs is also higher than historical ethanol subsidies. Additionally, a subsidy to encourage E85 use could reduce emissions at a cost equivalent to $1,320/metric ton CO2, which is approximately two orders of magnitude above the average social cost of carbon. Therefore, reducing emissions through more ethanol fuel use is not a cost-effective mitigation strategy.",2016,5/20/25 17:28,5/20/25 17:28,5/20/25 17:28,14043939 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 14043939 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science; 99999 Engineering not elsewhere classified; FOS: Other engineering and technologies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How can we model the travelers' strategic decisions in response to services provided by these platforms and develop tools to improve the aggregate outcomes in a socially desirable manner? In this thesis, we tackle this question from three aspects: 1) Game-theoretic analysis of the impact of information platforms (navigation apps) on the strategic behavior and learning processes of travelers in uncertain networks; 2) Market mechanism design for efficient carpooling and toll pricing in the presence of autonomous driving technology; 3) Security analysis and resource allocation for robustness under random or adversarial disruptions., Firstly, we present game-theoretic analysis to evaluate the impact of multiple heterogeneous information platforms on travelers' selfish routing decisions, and the resulting network congestion. We compare the value of information provided by multiple platforms to their users, and capture the key trade-off between the gain from information about uncertain network state and the congestion externality resulting from other users. We also design an optimal information structure that induces socially preferred traffic flows. Next, we extend the static model to a dynamic setting that addresses the behavior of users who learn and strategically act in an uncertain environment, while adapting their decisions to the up-to-date information received from platforms. The resulting stochastic learning dynamics requires analyzing strategic and adaptive (hence, endogenous and non i.i.d.) data. We present new results for convergence and stability of such learning dynamics and develop conditions for convergence to complete information equilibrium., Secondly, we design a market mechanism that enables efficient carpooling and optimal toll pricing in an autonomous transportation market. In this market, the transportation authority sets toll prices on edges, and riders organize carpooled trips using driverless cars and split payments. Riders have heterogeneous preferences, with the value of each trip depending on the travel time of chosen route and rider-specific parameters that capture their individual value of time and carpool disutilities. We identify sufficient conditions on the network topology and travelers' preferences under which a market equilibrium exists, and carpooling trips can be organized in a socially optimal manner. We also present an algorithm that computes a set of equilibrium trips, toll prices and payments that maximize rider utilities., Finally, we analyze stylized game-theoretic models of attacker-defender interactions for the purpose of evaluating security risks in transportation networks. Our equilibrium analysis suggests an optimal resource allocation strategy to defend multiple infrastructure facilities against an adversarial attacker. To evaluate robustness against random disturbances, we also develop a class of machine learning models that predict the change of travelers' usage demand in congestion-prone multi-modal networks. These results have the potential to help mitigate the impact of transportation network disruptions and limit security risks.",2021,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Information, learning and incentive design for urban transportation networks",,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Snowden disclosures in 2013 provided a peek into the surveillance landscape and the central role of ICT companies in fostering it. While attempting to salvage their tarnished reputations and encourage public discussion, several companies began to see an incentive in publishing 'transparency reports', providing statistics on user data requested by the government. Since then, publishing these reports has become a norm in the industry but the reports provide little benefit in bridging the transparency gap. The varying formats, definitions and levels of granularity in the reports and the absence of a governance framework in the industry, prevent the reports from becoming useful tools for stakeholders wishing to inform policy decisions. In addition, new technologies, modern surveillance techniques, and evolving business models have created a set of transparency requirements that is markedly different from the initial set of requirements established under the US Wiretap Act. This thesis identifies the missing elements in the current transparency reports while providing a detailed list of necessary features. In addition, it uncovers the incentives that can be leveraged using available tools to encourage better reporting practices and suggests technical, legal and policy solutions so that transparency reporting may become a useful public policy tool rather than a ritualistic practice.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Improving the transparency of government requests for user data from ICT companies,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This question is answered through a thorough study of the literature that investigates the complex relationship between the individual ex-offender and their interfacing ecological system(s). Information gleaned from secondary research will be analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Thematic analysis is a research approach that provides a framework for identifying relevant resources and outcome information, comparing and contrasting these sources of information, and reporting on themes discovered within this extant literature. For the purpose of this study, thematic analysis was used to describe and organize the data collected and provided a framework to interpret the multifarious factors influencing prison reentry outcomes. Against the current trends of deficit-based and fragmented explanations for the growing trends in poor prison-reentry outcomes, this study introduces and promotes alternate explanations that offer a holistic approach which includes both the ex-offender and ecological system factors as relevant influences to be considered when addressing the social problem of prison reentry. Future recommendations emphasizing the vital role that psychologists play in developing policies and practices that improve prison reentry outcomes are offered, including efficacious approaches that are relevant to each level of the espoused ecological system.",2014,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,Prison reentry from a psychological perspective,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Prison reentry from a psychological perspective: A study of the interfacing ecological factors that impact prison reentry outcomes ISBN: 9781321298772 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 1 Volume: 76,,,,,Civil society; Clinical psychology; Criminology; Imprisonment; Information resources; Prisons; Psychologists; Social problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is confirmed by a vast range of research on communications, irrespective of technology and protocol. Historically, the national metrology institutes are the distributors of stable accurate time and frequency through national timescales, but that situation has changed with the arrival of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS (Global Positioning System). The introduction of GNSS-based solutions has resulted in improvement for system users and owners in need of time and frequency. When using a GNSS receiver, sufficient accuracy and precision is often achieved. However, a disadvantage of this development is that GNSS-solutions are based on weak radio signals that can be interfered with. The main objective of the research that forms the groundwork for this thesis is the development of new fiber based methods for time and frequency. The aim is to complement GNSS-based methods for redundancy, with the intention of strengthening the robustness of the Swedish infrastructure. The research has resulted in two unique and innovative transmission technologies, one of which has been patented (two-color, one-way).The first method is based on a non-insertion technology that utilizes passive listening to existing data frames in a fiber optical network and does not require any particular bandwidth. This technology only uses a fraction of the optical signal for time and frequency measurement from an indirect connection to the network. This method has resulted in a precision relative to the GPS carrier phase of less than 1 ns root mean square for distances exceeding 1,100 km. This precision has been achieved for all of the included experiments, conducted within the framework of the thesis, regardless of configuration.The other fiber based technology is a one-way method that uses two wavelengths (colors) for the realization of a correction algorithm and signals thereto. It was developed because the symmetry required for performing two-way time and frequency transfer is rarely precise enough.This optical fiber technique was evaluated with respect to a GPS precise point positioning technique in an urban fiber optical network. The difference in frequency stability between the two systems has been shown to be about 3 × 10-15 over an averaging interval of 10,000 s for a distance of 3 km. The method has also been evaluated in several laboratory experiments with fiber distances up to 160 km. The best performing result is presented as time resolved transit time variations compared with arrival time difference. The standard deviation of the difference between the reference measurement and the one-way, two-color technique result is 3.12 ns and the data showed temperature dependence in transit time of 6 ns / °C.",2013,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Frequency Transfer Techniques and Applications in Fiber Optic Communication Systems ISBN: 9781392460825,,,,,Nanoscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Privacy is oftentimes not tangible, complicating the efforts of technology users to express and act according to their privacy needs. Additionally, people may not be fully aware of the risks they are subjecting themselves to once they use the Internet for financial transactions, or create profiles on online social networks. Companies post privacy policies inform people about their informational practices; but, this information is extremely difficult to use and typically not considered in users’ decision-making processes. Privacy concerns have also had an impact on users’ adoption of new technologies that share personal information. A plethora of mobile location-finding technologies applications have become available over the last two decades, but the products and services offered by the technology developers may not comprehensively address the privacy implications and privacy concerns surrounding their use. The design considerations for these products may not provide the necessarily amount of control or risk mitigation for users to ensure that their location information is not misused. In this thesis, I focus on the impact of salient privacy information on privacy concerns and behavior in two contexts: online shopping and the use of a mobile-location sharing technology. I examine several case studies focusing on the evolution of privacy attitudes after people use specific technologies. Based on the examination of the use of a location-sharing system, I highlight several design considerations for mobile-location application developers to ensure they address their users privacy concerns. I use the results of online surveys and user studies to provide concrete information on the impact of feedback on the comfort with using location-sharing technology. This research shows that users will pay a premium to purchase from websites that offer better privacy policies IF that privacy information is made visible and understandable. This research points to the importance of control in the management of privacy concerns. Whether it be mandated by legislation, or recommended in industry standards or design standards, offering users control in the form of understandable privacy policy information, or control over the disclosure of personal information by technology, is essential.",12/1/09,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723611.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the variables that contribute to lower rates of recidivism and factors that keep people from reoffending. Participants were recruited through college-based programs as well as work-study programs that help formerly incarcerated individuals. This study uses a qualitative phenomenological method with a semi-structured interview to explore each individual's experience of the penal system. Eight participants who have successfully reentered society were interviewed. This study found that during incarceration, the penal system was perceived by participants as problematic in some way, leading to a desire to change. External support was found to be the primary external variable that contributes to successful reentry. This support was evidenced by others showing interest in participants as well as the availability of tangible resources (e.g., higher education, housing, or employment). All participants cited introspection and a deep commitment to change (as compared to desire alone) as helpful internal variables. The common phenomena identified by this researcher are 1) a significant identity shift either during incarceration or after release, 2) a marked change in thought process adopted by the participant, and 3) a drive to be altruistic after release. For this population, clinical implications include the need to focus treatment on the following: risk reduction, setting realistic goals, frustration tolerance, emotional regulation, individual strengths, understanding one's locus of control, and preparing for acculturation during reentry. Treatment for trauma and substance abuse should be available for those that need it, and when possible, incorporating family therapy and altruistic activities for individuals is strongly encouraged. Each participant spoke to the need for systemic change; better communication and collaboration is needed between prison staff, policymakers, healthcare professionals, law enforcement, and current and former inmates. Through access to improved resources for formerly incarcerated individuals after release, the hope is that crime rates and recidivism will reduce, and taxpayers will save money.",2011,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,Closing the Revolving Door,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Closing the Revolving Door: Variables that Contribute to Lower rates of Recidivism in Prisons in the United States ISBN: 9781124902357 ISSN: 0419-4217 Issue: 12 Pages: 7703 Volume: 72,,,,,Acculturation; Clinical psychology; Communication; Criminology; Imprisonment; Prisoners; Recidivism; Risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8H6ABI3J,thesis,2020,"Perlman, Rachel Martha Katims; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems","Characterizing the materials footprint of a university campus: data, methods, recommendations",,,,,,"Universities are major consumers and disposers of many materials, but their specific flows are not well characterized. Both energy and material consumption drive a university's environmental impact. Many universities collect data about their energy consumption (from fuel usage or utility bills) and assess some resulting environmental impacts. However, very little effort has been focused on understanding purchasing, materials handling, and the resulting environmental impacts. To date, there have been few material flow analyses of universities; most analyses concern cities or countries. This paper describes a method for conducting a material flow analysis (MFA) of a university, and it offers the strategies used to obtain first-order characterization and quantification of the flows of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). This case study demonstrates that an MFA of a university requires the use of a portfolio of diverse methods that deliver different outcomes, which then must be pieced together. Inflows and stocks are characterized using financial data, and waste flows are quantified by mass data. Flows are characterized using a combination of product/commodity descriptors and materials. Material purchases are characterized by product category, temporal variation, purchasing unit/entity, and level of decentralization. The top five purchase categories (by spend) in descending order are: (1) laboratory supplies; (2) hardware purchases/maintenance; (3) laboratory equipment; (4) chemicals, reagents & gases; (5) office furniture. The study also reports the largest stocks of durable goods by quantity and dollar value, as well as the average residence time, or lifetime, of different products. The results also catalogue the quantity and disposal/recycling destinations of different waste streams, including municipal solid waste, single-stream recycling, hazardous waste, medical waste, and radioactive waste. To estimate the embodied GHG emissions from purchases, spend data was used with an economic input-output life cycle assessment (EIO-LCA). The product categories with the largest embodied emissions were found to be laboratory supplies, chemicals/gases, office furniture, and electronics. The total embodied greenhouse gas emissions of material goods purchased in FY2016 was found to be roughly 78,800 metric tons of CO2-eq. This is significant compared to Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Emissions from waste management were estimated using waste generation figures and EPA's WARM model; the results indicate that the greenhouse gas impact from waste is much smaller than that from procurement. This study also reports the findings from sixteen in-person interviews conducted with MIT community members that make purchases. Among other findings, the interviews revealed that purchasers currently have a high level of individual agency and freedom. Purchasers also reported that they would like easily accessible information and guidelines for how to purchase sustainably, as well as formalized incentives for buying more sustainably and conserving materials. Currently, the purchasing process is carried out independently of any consideration of the materials' end of life (a linear system, rather than having circularity for sustainability). University entities are autonomous in their purchasing, with some using different systems, which makes complicates the tracking material consumption. This work provides several recommendations for making MFAs easier to perform at the university-level and for reducing the materials and carbon footprint of a research universities. Some key recommendations include: centralizing data collection and storage on procurement and waste; requiring more detailed product-level data from vendors; and creating web-based interdepartmental sharing programs for material goods.",2020,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,Characterizing the materials footprint of a university campus,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2020 Ph.D.,"Book Title: Characterizing the materials footprint of a university campus : data, methods, recommendations",,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose a methodology to create a data-driven decision process for post-disaster resource allocation that enables timely, transparent and consistent decision-making during crisis. Our methodology defines the decisions that must be made, identifies relevant historical, initial, and trending data sources, and develops numerical thresholds, quantitative relationships, and optimization models to support decision making. The general process also offers flexibility to consider non-quantitative factors and spans multiple review periods. We apply this methodology to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) program for establishing and managing Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs) after a disaster. A detailed case study of one disaster response and relevant historical data provide the basis for DRC decision making thresholds, relationships, and optimization models. We then apply the newly developed process to several recent disaster response scenarios and find that FEMA could have reduced cost by 60-80% while providing sufficient capacity for survivors.

The earliest cetacean tags were Discovery marks developed by the British Colonial Office at the turn of the 20th century, and their influence continues to inform some of the implanted cetacean tags being deployed. Today, there are a wide variety of tags in use that can be broadly divided into two principal categories driven by the length of attachment required-disposable transmitting systems that are implanted in the animals and archival tags that must be recovered in order to collect the data. Archival tags typically use a non-invasive attachment with a release to get the data back. These tags provide essential information for conservation and management of these vulnerable species. In the United States, a broad suite of regulations protects cetaceans and other marine mammals. Welfare protection stems from the Animal Welfare Act and Conservation protection stems from the Marine Mammal Protection and Endangered Species Acts. To navigate this policy landscape, both regulators and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees need to weigh the benefits of a tagging study against the potential for serious harm and evaluate whether a proposed method is the least harmful way to answer a scientific question. However, the effects of tagging wild cetaceans are not well-understood and difficult to compare, leading to challenges for objectively assessing proposals. In this environment of uncertainty, specific guidelines from professional societies would be helpful, but varying institutional and individual approaches to the balance between conservation and welfare will make consensus difficult. Given this context, we ought to employ the precautionary principle when evaluating impacts, interpreting guidelines and implementing them.",2015,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,Tagging wild cetaceans,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Tagging wild cetaceans : investigating the balance between more and less invasive techniques,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both discuss new fuel types, but neither provides methodological guidelines for dealing with the inherent uncertainty in evaluating their potential life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions reductions are based on point estimates only. This work develops a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate life-cycle emissions distributions from ethanol and butanol from corn or switchgrass. Life-cycle emissions distributions for each of the modelled feedstock and fuel pairings span an order of magnitude or more. Corn ethanol emissions range from 50 to 200 g CO2e/MJ, and each feedstock-fuel pathway studied shows some probability of greater emissions than a distribution for gasoline. Potential GHG emissions reductions from displacing fossil fuels with biofuels are difficult to forecast given this high degree of uncertainty in life-cycle emissions. Incorporating uncertainty in the decision making process can illuminate the risks of policy failure (e.g., increased emissions), and a calculated risk of failure due to uncertainty can be used to inform more appropriate reduction targets in future biofuel policies. The current practice of modelling cellulosic biomass yields based on point values that have been aggregated over space and over time conceal important energy supply risks related to depending on biomass for transportation energy, particularly those related to local drought conditions. Using switchgrass as a case study, this work quantifies the variability in expected yields over time and space with a switchgrass growth model and historical weather data. Even with stable, productive states, yields vary from 5 to 20 Mg/ha. Yields are likely to be reduced with increased temperatures and weather variability induced by climate change. Thus, variability needs to be a central part of biomass systems modelling so that risks to energy supplies are acknowledged and risk mitigation strategies or contingency plans are considered. Irrigation, a potential risk mitigation strategy, can very often negate the impacts of drought, although system-wide irrigation is an expensive method to stabilize crops (costing $0.10 to $1.90/gallon). Unless many surplus acres of cellulosic crops are planted, there will be insufficient ethanol to meet the EISA targets 10 to 25% of the time under rain-fed conditions. Thinking in terms of yield ranges, not point estimates, is essential in planning a long-term energy system dependent on biomass.",12/1/12,5/20/25 17:37,5/20/25 17:37,5/20/25 17:37,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716471.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/P4UWQ5VK/Mullins - 2012 - Evaluating Biomass Energy Policy in the Face of Emissions Reductions Uncertainty and Feedstock Suppl.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It answers the question: Can corporations tie corporate social responsibility to the profit-making mission, and, if so, how? We define CSR as the actions that exceed the expectations placed upon the corporation. We demonstrate that the level of expectations, separating social irresponsibility from responsibility, is dynamic-changing over time and by region. This level is influenced by the maximum of three forces: social norms, market forces, regulatory standards. Actions that exceed expectations, what we consider CSR, are then categorized here in three broad groups: 1) Philanthropic: projects dealing with social good that have little or no relation to the corporate mission. 2) Strategic: initiatives that align and advance social and business goals simultaneously. 3) Social: actions typically addressed by social entrepreneurship designed and executed predominantly to target a social need. Finally, we validate the CSR framework and introduce areas of value-creation to be considered by corporations when making the decision to perform CSR.

The transaction data for about 10,000 merchants in a specific country, was analyzed in terms of their diversity and propensity of customers for factors like age, distance they travel to shop, time of the day, day of the week, educational status, gender etc. While diversity refers to the variety in the different groups, propensity refers to concentration of customers in specific groups. These factors were used as independent variables to predict the financial well-being of merchants, particularly in two dimensions -total revenue and consistency in revenue, both relative to other merchants in the same industry. The merchants were also divided into the categories of Essential, Nonessential and Luxury goods depending on the industry they belong to and it was interesting to observe the contrast across categories. While the individual correlations were weak but significant, feature selection and classification (using logistic regression) indicate that diversity and propensity for factors of 'Age', 'Time of the day' and 'Day of the week' show reasonable prediction capabilities for total revenue and consistency in revenue for a merchant, as compared to the industry average. These kind of inputs can be very useful from a bank's perspective if an existing business customer of a bank wants to apply for a loan and the bank needs to assess the application. The analysis can be a good augmentation to the current methods or models of determining the financial wellbeing of a merchant. Also, this kind of analysis can bring a fresh perspective to the merchants to look at the customer base and then to target the right customers for achieving the business objectives of above average and consistent revenue streams.",2014,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, System Design and Management Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis SD&M 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Assessing financial well-being of merchants by analyzing behavioral patterns in historical transactions,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; System Design and Management Program; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, battery research focused on reducing the lifetime costs, manufacturing and waste impacts, and mining pressures associated with existing battery technologies are of utmost importance. To contribute to this effort, this dissertation delves into technological innovations at several key steps in the battery supply chain, from end-of-life assessment and reuse to raw material selection prior to manufacturing. Chapter 2 focuses on developing a holistic assessment of the state-of-health (SOH) of batteries after use in a hybrid-electric vehicle with the goal of selecting cells for reuse in a second-life application. Four hundred LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (LFP) cells were sampled from a retired hybrid-vehicle battery pack and tested using constantcurrent cycling, the current gold standard, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), a faster and cheaper alternative to cycling. In contrast to existing battery diagnostic studies, which only report cell capacity and resistance, this chapter analyzes correlations between battery diagnostic parameters, the spatial dependence of SOH within the pack, and correlations between cycling and EIS test results. We found that SOH variation within the pack is high in used EV packs, making it unfavorable to reuse them without refurbishment. We also found strong correlations between EIS and cycling tests under specific EIS test conditions, suggesting that low-cost, fast EIS tests are potentially valuable substitutes for cycling tests. Furthermore, using two distinct acceptance criteria, we estimated that 75% or 94% of modules and 90 or 99% of cells would likely be useful in second-life applications, respectively. Chapter 3 presents an assessment of the economic and technical feasibility of repurposing spent LFP cells based on the state-of-health insights from Chapter 2. We developed a model for investigating whether battery reuse can provide an economically sustainable solution to the problem of spent battery management while also addressing grid storage needs. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we probabilistically compared the pack lifetime, manufacturer revenue, and levelized cost of storage for end-users across two common battery chemistries—LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (LFP) and Li-Ni-Mn-Co (NMC)—within two applications—residential load-following and renewables firming. We found that LFP outperforms NMC in terms of revenue, enduser costs, and lifespan across various pack processing strategies. We also found that residential loadfollowing demonstrated superior revenue potential over renewables firming, despite the lower capital costs associated with the latter. Our results suggest that reusing entire packs might offer longer lifetimes and potentially lower costs for end-users than other strategies, but future research should study the safety implication of this method. However, pack sizing sensitivity analysis suggested that producing smaller packs drastically increased the optimistic estimates of lifetime. Chapter 4 focuses on recycling pathways for commercial batteries. In particular, we assessed the possibility of directly recycling LFP cathodes. We tested three types of cathode relithiation treatments—lithium iodide (LI), lithium hydroxide with citric acid, annealed (LHC), and lithium iodide, annealed (LIA). Cathode materials' crystal structure, morphology, composition, and electrochemical performance were characterized before and after relithiation. Based on insights from the LI and LHC methods, we developed the novel LIA method, which combines a galvanic relithiation process with a solid-state annealing process, yielding the best performance results for all states of health. In contrast, the LI method, which lacked a solid-state annealing process, restored the LiFePO<sub>4</sub> crystal structure of the harvested material but did not fully restore the characteristic electrochemical discharge profile of LiFePO<sub>4</sub>. The LHC method worked well on samples from two healthier cells but severely degraded the sample from the least healthy cell. We implemented a techno-economic analysis, which showed that LI and LIA relithiation are considerably more expensive than LHC relithiation due to the high cost of lithium iodide. However, all three relithiation methods were shown to be cost-competitive with LFP manufacturing for specific ranges in lithium replacement fractions. LHC relithiation was the lowest cost manufacturing process, with estimated breakeven recovery costs ranging from 5 to 30 USD per kg (10-61 USD per kWh) at 100% lithium replacement. Finally, Chapter 5 showcases an innovative alkaline MnO<sub>2</sub> cathode and electrolyte pairing. The system explored in this concluding project offers advantages in terms of lower costs, raw material abundance, enhanced safety, and comparable full-cell capacity to LFP. We found that electrochemical synthesis and cycling of layered MnO<sub>2</sub> (birnessite) can be improved using lower-cost NaOH electrolyte, which has not been studied in relevant existing literature, instead of the higher-cost KOH electrolyte, which has been repeatedly studied in existing literature. Furthermore, the birnessite cathode’s cycling stability was significantly improved in electrolyte-starved environments, demonstrating a stable capacity of approximately 400 mAh/g for over 400 cycles in NaOH. To our knowledge, NaOH and electrolyte-starved environments have not been studied in existing birnessite cathode literature. Thus, this study demonstrates essential directions for future research in improving the commercial viability of this low-cost, environmentally sustainable alternative to Li-ion batteries.",2023,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,11240642 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 11240642 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Materials Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The electricity grid acts as the essential infrastructure of contemporary society. Decarbonizing it will require a shift to cleaner and low-carbon energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydropower, to meet national decarbonization goals. Public acceptance plays a pivotal role in the success of electricity decarbonization goals. The transition to low-carbon energy sources, such as renewables, hinges on gaining support and understanding from the public. This will require decision-makers and other community leaders to recognize and address public concerns. At the same time, they foster public awareness of the benefits of low-carbon technologies and engage communities in decision-making.  This dissertation delves into public preferences and social approval of low-carbon technologies in the context of US decarbonization. Chapter 2 introduces Grid2050, a dynamic web-based tool developed using R Shiny that supports users in exploring alternative portfolios of present and possible future electricity generation technologies. A version of this tool serves as a framework for Chapter 3, which focuses on a public survey assessing preferences for low-carbon 2035 electricity portfolios. The study reveals diverse technology preferences where portfolios include novel technologies like CCS and offshore wind. Also, preferences are influenced by demographic factors, such as age, income, and attitudes, emphasizing the need for adaptive strategies. Chapter 4 explores the prediction of county-level wind receptivity using a machine-learning model and data from withdrawn wind project submissions. The results highlight regional variations in factors impacting receptivity, offering a model with potential application to assess the viability of various technologies in different areas. In conclusion, the dissertation contributes valuable insights into public preferences, technology acceptance, and regional receptivity, offering a comprehensive approach to advancing the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable, and resilient energy future in the United States.",2024,5/20/25 15:59,5/20/25 15:59,5/20/25 15:59,4754539 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 4754539 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Environmental Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current accuracy of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) technique is below centimetre level and this allows very accurate determination of velocity field parameters. This study focused on utilizing GNSS to determine the intercontinental plate velocity field for Africa in support of the African Geodetic Reference Frame (AFREF). Data spanning 12.4 years were processed in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2008) using GAMIT/GLOBK 10.4 (developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Primarily, processing of data focused on International GNSS Service (IGS) stations with a few non-IGS stations (which are of geodetic quality) included, such as Hamburg (HAMB) and Matjiesfontein (MATJ). The same data set was analysed using the Combination and Analyses of Terrestrial Reference Frame (CATREF) software developed at Institut National de l’Information Géographique et Forestière (IGN). Validation of the results was achieved through comparison of the velocity solution from this study with a solution obtained from a core of IGS GNSS stations processed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). No significant differences were evident between the GAMIT/GLOBK 10.4, CATREF and JPL solutions. The results from the Matjiesfontein station indicated that the proposed Matjiesfontein Observatory site shows no significant vertical or horizontal local motion; this information is valuable in that there is no obvious local site instability. The velocity field as derived by GNSS displays no unexpected deviations and supports current understanding of the motion of the Nubian, Somalian and Arabian plates. Furthermore, the comparison of the velocity vectors derived from the IGS station HRAO, Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) MOBLAS-6 station and 26 m Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) telescope, which are collocated at the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO) indicated good agreement and both techniques exhibit no significant vertical motion. This study also contributed to the first computation of the AFREF solution. It is envisaged that as more stations are added to the sparsely distributed current network, more accurate results and better tectonic models can be derived. The availability of station velocities will facilitate adjustments within the AFREF.",2013,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Determination of geodetic velocity field parameters for the African tectonic plate using the technique of Global Navigation Satellite Systems ISBN: 9781321956054,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This data has the potential for enabling new insights that can change the way business, science, and governments deliver services to their consumers and can impact society as a whole. This has led to the emergence of the Big Data Computing paradigm focusing on sensing, collection, storage, management and analysis of data from variety of sources to enable new value and insights. To realize the full potential of Big Data Computing, we need to address several challenges and develop suitable conceptual and technological solutions for dealing them. Today's and tomorrow's extreme-scale computing systems, such as the world’s fastest supercomputers, are generating orders of magnitude more data by a variety of scientific computing applications from all disciplines. This dissertation addresses several big data challenges at extreme scales. First, we quantitatively studied through simulations the predicted performance of existing systems at future scales (for example, exascale 1018 flops). Simulation results suggestedthat current systems would likely fail to deliver the needed performance at exascale. Then, we proposed a new system architecture and implemented a prototype that was evaluated on tens of thousands nodes on par with the scale of today's largest supercomputers. Micro benchmarks and real-world applications demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed architecture: the prototype achieved up to two orders of magnitude higher data movement rate than existing approaches. Moreover, the system prototype was incorporated with features that were not well supported in conventional systems, such as distributed metadata management, distributed caching, lightweight provenance, transparent compression, acceleration through GPU encoding, and parallel serialization. Towards exploring the proposed architecture at millions of node scales, simulations were conducted and evaluated with a variety of workloads, showing near linear scalability and orders of magnitude better performance than today's state-of-the-art storage systems.",2015,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Big data system infrastructure at extreme scales ISBN: 9781339224152,,,,,Computer science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of the PPE supply chain to provide adequate and consistent supply when there is a large spike in demand has not been well-considered. Humanitarian logistics literature rarely considers infectious disease outbreaks as possible humanitarian crises while epidemiology literature assumes perfectly responsive supply chains. This thesis uses a mixed methods approach - an exploratory case study and system dynamics model - to bridge the gap between these two fields. It provides one approach for connecting epidemiology and supply chain research. An explanatory case study of the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak is used to analyze the PPE supply chain and its in-crisis functionality. We gather primary data using semi-structured interviews with supply chain actors and analyze that data using qualitative coding analysis. The system dynamics model is developed based on the results of the case study to offer insight as to how the PPE supply chain could be improved to better respond to future outbreaks. Several scenarios are simulated to test the effects of various supply chain improvement strategies. Relationship-building between supply chain actors, unconstrained shipping channels, flexible funding pools, and pre-positioning are all found to be effective supply chain improvement strategies.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: A mixed methods approach to modeling personal protective equipment supply chains for infectious disease outbreak response,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94QXDTUI,thesis,2012,"Salamanca, Juan",Designing Smart Artifacts for Adaptive Mediation of Social Viscosity: Triadic Actor-Network Enactments as a Basis for Interaction Design,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1372291746?pq-origsite=primo,"With the advent of ubiquitous computing, interaction design has broadened its object of inquiry into how smart computational artifacts inconspicuously act in people's everyday lives. Although user-centered design approaches remains useful for exploring how people cope with interactive systems, they cannot explain how this new breed of artifacts participates in people's sociality. User-centered design approach assumes that humans control interactive systems, disregarding the agency of smart artifacts. Based on Actor-Network Theory, this research recognizes that artifacts and humans share the capacity of influencing society and meshing with each other, constituting hybrid social actors. From that standpoint, the research offers a triadic structure of networked social interaction as a methodological basis to investigate how smart devices perceive their social setting and adaptively mediate people's interactions within activities. These triadic units of analysis account for the interactions within and between human-nonhuman collectives in the actor-network. The ""within interactions"" are those that hold together humans and smart artifacts inside a collective and put forward the collective's assembled meaning for other actors in the network. The ""between interactions"" are those that occur among collectives and characterize the dominant relational model of the actor-network. This triadic approach was modeled and used to analyze the interactions of participants in three empirical studies of social activities with communal goals, each mediated by a smart artifact that enacted--signified--a balanced distribution of obligations and privileges among subjects. Overall, the studies found that actor-networks exhibit a social viscosity that hinders people's interactions. This is because when people try to collectively accomplish goals, they offer resistance to one another. The studies also show that the intervention of smart artifacts can facilitate the achievement of cooperative and collaborative interaction between actors when the artifacts enact the dominant moral principles which prompt the ""preservation of social balance,"" enhance the network's ""information integrity,"" and are located at the ""focus of activity."" The articulation of Actor-Network Theory principles with interaction design methods opens up the traditional user-artifact dyad towards triadic collective enactments by embracing diverse kinds of participants and practices, thus facilitating the design of enhanced sociality.

However, the lack of population-specific method often made it unreliable in some population groups. The influence of socioeconomic conditions as well as interethnic and interracial variation on skeletal epiphyseal union phases has been acknowledged in scientific literature. Therefore, the importance of developing reliable population-specific age estimation methodology for the specific geographic region is outlined. The ossification patterns of the first costal cartilage represent another interesting feature of the same anatomical region which according to its position in human body is accessible for examinations in living individuals who undergo conventional radiographic and computed tomography examinations in the same field of view as clavicle. The broad range of macroscopic, histomorphometric and radiological analyses were conducted in order to establish the reliable age indicator. However, it remained unclear whether introduction of new more precise anatomical and other criteria in analyses of the medial clavicle and the first costal cartilage as well as their mutual analyses would be beneficial for age estimation. Therefore, this study encompassed our local population and was carried out with aim to examine whether morphological, radiological and histological analysis of medial clavicles as well as radiological examination of the first costal cartilage could be applied with success in age assessment of individuals. The study was composed of two sections. The first part of the study encompassed the collection of medial clavicles which was founded in cooperation of Laboratory for Anthropology, Institute of Anatomy with the Institute of Forensic Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade. The sample comprised 67 medial clavicles derived from individuals of different sex with age range from 20 to 90 years.During the assessment of macroscopic morphological features the progress of epiphyseal union was recorded by applying a three-phase scoring system developed by Schaefer and Black. Further macroscopic analyses of the medial clavicles involved studies of the following morphological features: basic morphology, relief, porosity and shape of the articular surface, presence of ossific nodule, morphology of the articular surface margin, and morphology of the notch for the first costal cartilage. Subsequently, the conducted histological analyses of medial clavicles involved following bone histomorphometric parameters: cortical width, cancellous bone area/tissue area, and minimum trabecular width, in accordance with the standards of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.The second part of the study data encompassed multislice computed tomography (CT) examinations of thoracic region of 154 patients in Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, aged between 15 and 35 years in the moment of performed diagnostic procedure. CT scan images allowed the assessment of the ossification status of medial clavicular epiphyseal cartilage following five-phase scoring system developed by Schmeling et al. and modified by Schulz et al., recording of thickness of the anterior and posterior cortex, enlargement of medullar canal, diameter of clavicular shaft and radiodensity of sternal epiphyseal-metaphyseal region. The assessment of the bony changes of anterior and posterior margin of costal face which extend through cartilage medially to sternum was carried out in concordance to published methodology of Moskovitch et al. The analyses of the first costal cartilage also made distinction in the sex, lateralization, number of present linear projections i.e. beaks, and radiodensity of costal cartilage.",2013,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Age Estimation Based on Analyses of Sternal End of Clavicle and the First Costal Cartilage ISBN: 9798383125519,,,,,Bones; Calcification; Forensic anthropology; Physical anthropology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies conducted since the early 1990s have observed several changes in public understanding of the causes and consequences of climate change. The aim of this thesis is to explore public understanding and perceptions of various aspects of climate science, climate change, and its impacts. This work provides an update on the climate change perceptions literature, identifying new and persistent knowledge gaps, as well as characterizing the belief-driven undercurrent that consistently predicts support for immediate climate action across my studies.In Chapter 2, I employ a local mail-out survey and a national online survey to explore the extent to which people understand the important differences between common air pollution and carbon dioxide (CO2). This work focuses especially on the very different atmospheric residence times of both—and what drives public support to abate climate change now. I find that people do not understand this fundamental difference, dramatically underestimate how long CO2 remains in the atmosphere and continues to change the climate, and the policy implications of long-lived CO2 in the atmosphere. However, this misunderstanding does not deter respondents from showing strong support for immediate climate action.While Chapter 2 focuses on drivers of climate change, in Chapter 3, I evaluate public perceptions of one of the most salient impacts of climate change: an increase in the frequency of extreme weather. In a two-part study comprised of a convenience sample of face-to-face interviews followed by a national study, I assess when, and to what extent, laypeople attribute extreme events to climate change and whether and how their beliefs are predictive of their decision thresholds, sensitivities, and support for immediate climate action using signal detection theory. I find that prior climate change beliefs are significant drivers that influence how people make decisions in attributing extreme events to climate change and in their self-reported support for immediate action in response to climate risks. I also find that simple spinner boards are effective tools in communicating non-stationary processes, such as attribution, to laypeople.In Chapter 4, I focus on public perceptions of what can be done on the part of individuals to reduce CO2 emissions and how laypeople view the efficacy of individual versus collective actions in a two-part study, starting with a convenience sample of face-to-face interviews and followed by a national study. I find that respondents believe that individuals have higher response-efficacy than what is likely to be attainable from individual actions alone, i.e. apart from any broader societal or governmental action. However, respondents view individual and governmental actions as having the same response-efficacy.Finally, Chapter 5 discusses this work’s contribution to the literature and the implications for the development of risk communications revealed in Chapters 2 through 4. Findings in all chapters show strong support for immediate action against climate risks. Climate change beliefs are significant predictors for decision thresholds and sensitivities in identifying hurricane frequencies as evidence of climate change (Chapter 2) and for support for immediate climate action across my studies (Chapters 2 and 3). These, and other findings reported in the thesis, can inform—and offer opportunities for—the development of improved risk communications, as well as alternative decision-making strategies when it comes to long-term risks and educational interventions.",6/5/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:32,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/8218931.v1,,"/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/WBEDB7KX/Dryden - 2019 - Public Understanding of Climate Science, Extreme Weather and Climate Attribution.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All had worked as exotic dancers at various venues in multiple cities in the United States. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the way female exotic dancers experience, construct and understand their lives (i.e. identities, desires, conflicts, and behaviors) in relation to dancing. The secondary purpose of this research was to explore the ways that female exotic dancers experience mental health care. This study utilized a relational, qualitative, ""feminist voice-centered"" method of data analysis geared to study subjective lived experience (Brown & Gilligan, 1992). Unlike traditional research, the methodology used in this study called for consultation between coresearchers and the primary researcher to clarify information shared during the interview. Using the voice-centered relational method of analysis, themes emerged that provide special considerations for psychotherapists to take into account when working within this community of women. The primary finding was the pervasiveness of whore stigma within the internal and external worlds of coresearchers. The secondary finding was that stigma plays a fundamental role in the therapeutic process. Specifically, coresearchers described the ways that they construct their lives around the experience of stigma as they debate whether and when to disclose their work, develop a hypersensitivity about trust, and isolate from society and the people they love most; they do this to protect themselves from the sting of the experience of stigma, and find themselves isolated from their core self. Suggestions derived from the data are offered to enhance therapeutic effectiveness for this under-researched population. This project took special care to understand the conscious choice to engage in the exaggeration of gender dynamics at play in strip clubs. Special care was also taken to consider the psychological impact of the discriminatory sanctioning of some expressions of female sexuality over others.

This thesis establishes the strategies for the public RTOs in a developing country of Africa, taking Botswana as the case scenario. The aim of the strategies is to leverage the operations of public RTOs to enhance technological research and innovation that will address Africa's development problems. Developing countries around the world are seeking ways to enhance economic growth by improving key institutes of knowledge, innovation and technological advancement. The importance of technological research institutes in an economy cannot be overemphasized. The public research and technology organisations form a pivotal category of the key actors that accentuate innovation towards economic development. They are key players in the national innovation system (NIS), and therefore important to be embedded in it. The study identified three (3) research questions as: (i) what are the characteristics of public research and technology organisations (RTOs) in Botswana? (ii) what is the role of RTOs in the national innovation system (NIS)? (iii) what are the appropriate strategies for research and technology organisations (RTOs) in Botswana? The compass card model was applied when conducting the empirical study and to address the research questions. The application of the model enabled capturing data which has not been obtained before; therefore, the study contributes information to the body of literature about the characteristics of public laboratories in a Sub-Saharan African country.

There is much interest in improving our understanding of the nature, dynamics and impact of this cooperation in science. This thesis contributes to this area in three dimensions. First, it proposes a novel method by which one can characterize and assess research collaboration, which takes into consideration the self-organizing process of scientific collaboration. Second, building partially on the new method, it studies how research collaboration, in particular research groups and scientific stars, influence the nurturing of new researchers that enter a scientific system. Finally, it explores in detail what the new researchers look for, and find, in their early collaborations. The field of physics and related areas (including applied physics, material sciences and optics) in Mexico is used to look at these issues. The proposed evaluation method uses self-organizing characteristics of science to identify and compare relevant units of analysis. To characterize groups, the thesis exploits the patterns of collaboration and develops a method that identifies and benchmarks research groups. Collaboration patterns of researchers are used to identify the frontiers of the focal research units and the backward citation patterns are employed to establish relevant benchmark units for each focal unit. The results suggest that the definition of the unit of analysis affects our understanding of the position a research institutions has within the Science Technology and Innovation (ST&I) System and provides evidence that the performance of Mexican institutions in Physics is highly heterogeneous within institutions. This is important because research administrators and policy makers need to take into account this heterogeneity when assessing the ST&I system. The second contribution of this thesis is an investigation of how different forms of scientific collaboration early on in the career of a researcher relate to his or her future publication and citation rates, and their likelihood of becoming a leading scientist. In particular it quantifies the effect of collaborative research environments, such as prominent scientists or research groups (identified using the method developed in the thesis), on new scholars. This study shows that eminent scientists have an important role in the development of a scientific system (especially within the context of an emerging economy) in terms of publications and citations. In particular it finds that these stars have a positive and significant effect on the productivity and impact of young researchers, as well as on their likelihood of also becoming leading scientists. In addition, early collaboration with a highly productive research group and the leader of this group also contributes to superior productivity performance by scientists. Third, this thesis explores how budding scientists, some of which became highly accomplished researchers, used their collaborations with other top scientists and research groups early in their career. This works finds that researchers who later became star scientists focus on acquiring new ideas and knowledge through early interactions with other scientists, particularly foreign collaborators and existing stars, whereas those less prominent focus on accessing resources and only learning “basic” research kills, like publishing. Finally, this thesis provides important insights for policy makers by showing the significance research collaboration has in the development of ST&I of an emerging economy. In addition, this work highlights the importance of endogenously defining the unit of analysis and taking into account the heterogeneity within the system when making assessments of the ST&I system. Furthermore, this dissertation shows the relevance scientific stars surrounded by nurturing environments have in the progress of science, as well as the importance cooperation with these scientists and foreign collaboration has in exposing young faculty to new ideas.",5/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721322.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9DAHKYDQ,thesis,2020,"Sun, Rui; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Online learning and optimization in operations management,,,,,,"We study in this thesis online learning and optimization problems in operations management where we need to make decisions in the face of incomplete information and operational constraints in a dynamic environment. We first consider an online matching problem where a central platform needs to match a number of limited resources to different groups of users that arrive sequentially over time. The platform does not know the reward of each matching option and must learn the true rewards from the matching results. We formulate the problem as a Markovian multi-armed bandit with budget constraints, and propose an innovative algorithm that is based on assembling the policies for each single arm. We prove the algorithm's worst-case performance guarantee, and numerically show the algorithm's robust performance compared to alternative heuristics. We next consider a revenue management problem with add-on discounts where a retailer offers discounts on selected supportive products (e.g. video games) to customers who have also purchased the core products (e.g. video game consoles). When the products' demand functions are unknown, we propose a UCB-based learning algorithm that uses the an FPTAS optimization algorithm as a subroutine to determine the prices of different types of products. We show that the algorithm can converge to the optimal full-information pricing policy. We also conduct numerical experiments with real-world data to illustrate the performance of our algorithm and the advantage of using the add-on discount strategy in practice. We last consider a network revenue management problem where a retailer aims to maximize revenue from multiple products with limited inventory. The retailer does not know the demand of different products, and must learn demand from the sales data. To optimize the pricing decisions, we propose an efficient algorithm that combines the Thompson sampling technique and the online gradient descent method with a primal-dual framework. In comparison to traditional algorithms that are based on frequently solving linear programs, our algorithm does not need to solve any linear program, and therefore, has the advantage in computational efficiency. We analyze the performance guarantee of our algorithm, and show the algorithm's fast running time through numerical experiments.",2020,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2020 Ph.D.,Book Title: Online learning and optimization in operations management ISBN: 9781227276683,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9EENL2W6,thesis,2016,"Staples, Mark Douglas; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",Bioenergy and its use to mitigate the climate impact of aviation,,,,,,"The use of modern bioenergy presents an opportunity to mitigate CO2 emissions contributing to anthropogenic climate change by offsetting fossil fuel use, and the work presented in this thesis contributes to the literature on bioenergy and climate change mitigation in three areas. First, this thesis quantifies the maximum potential reduction in global lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the use of bioenergy to offset demand for fossil fuel-derived electricity, heat and liquid fuels in 2050. The findings indicate that bioenergy could reduce annual emissions from these end-uses by a maximum of 4.9-38.7 Gt CO2e, or 9-68%. The range of results reflects different assumptions defining potential bioenergy availability, and fossil fuel demand that could by offset by bioenergy, in 2050. In general, assumptions leading to greater calculated bioenergy availability, and fossil fuel demand, correspond to larger reductions in anthropogenic GHG emissions. In addition, offsetting fossil fuel-fired electricity and heat with bioenergy is found to be 1.6-3.9 times more effective for emissions mitigation than offsetting fossil fuel-derived liquid fuel, on average. At the same time, liquid fuels make up 18-49% of global final bioenergy in the scenarios considered for 2050, demonstrating that a mix of bioenergy end-uses maximizes lifecycle emissions reductions. The analysis also finds that GHG emissions reductions are maximized by limiting deployment of total available primary bioenergy to 29-91%, showing that lifecycle emissions including land use change (LUC) are a constraint on the usefulness of bioenergy for mitigating global climate change. Next, this thesis quantifies the environmental and economic performance of fermentation and advanced fermentation (AF) technologies for the production of renewable middle distillate (MD) fuels, including jet and diesel, in terms of lifecycle GHG emissions and minimum selling price (MSP). The attributional lifecycle GHG emissions of AF MD derived from sugarcane, corn grain and switchgrass are found to range from -27.0 to 19.7, 47.5 to 117.5, and 11.7 to 89.8 gCO2e/MJMD, respectively, compared to 90.0 gCO2e/MJMD for conventional petroleum-derived MD. These results are most sensitive to the co-product allocation method used, the efficiency and utility requirements of feedstock-to-fuel conversion, and the co-generation technology employed. The MSP of MD fuel produced from sugarcane, corn grain and switchgrass AF is also calculated as a range from 0.61 to 2.63, 0.84 to 3.65, and 1.09 to 6.30 USD20l2 /literMD. For comparison, the price of MD fuel was 0.80 USD2O2/literMD when this analysis was initially carried out in 2013, and was $0.38 USD2O2/literMD at the time of writing. This analysis demonstrates that improvements in overall feedstock-to-fuel conversion efficiency, for example from more efficient sugar extraction, enzymatic hydrolysis, or metabolic conversion processes, could lead to reductions in both the lifecycle GHG emissions and MSP of AF MD fuels. The final contribution of this thesis is a dynamic cost-benefit assessment (CBA) of a policy of large-scale alternative jet (AJ) fuel adoption, in terms of the societal climate damages and fuel production costs attributable to aviation. A system dynamics model is developed to capture time- and path-dependence of the environmental and economic performance of AJ technologies, as well as potential non-linearities and feedbacks associated with their adoption. The analysis finds that the large-scale use of AJ could result in a reduction in the net present value (NPV) of the societal costs of aviation, in terms of climate damages and fuel costs. However, even for the most promising feedstock-to-fuel production pathways considered, a net reduction in the societal costs of aviation has a probability of less than 50% if the initial societal opportunity cost of AJ feedstock exceeds 140 USD2015 /tfeedstock, or if land use change (LUC) emissions associated with incremental feedstock demand exceed 4.2 tCO2/inc. feedstock. These results highlight the potential importance of waste- and residue-derived AJ for reducing the societal costs of aviation, as these feedstocks represent a lower risk of LUC emissions and potentially lower societal opportunity costs than commodity crops.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2017 Ph.D.,Book Title: Bioenergy and its use to mitigate the climate impact of aviation,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Road networks ranging from highways to local roads are tuned to the needs of the many personal vehicles that are used for commuting and personal trips. Unfortunately, this well-developed system suffers from an oversaturation of the existing infrastructure. Traffic congestion costs society in the form of lost time as well as environmental damage from automobile emissions. In an effort to reduce congestion, some cities have invested bicycling infrastructure to discourage automobile use in favor of cycling. Cycling presents a number of benefits over vehicular commuting. Bicycles take up considerably less space on roads, do not actively contribute to pollution, and provide exercise to commuters. Despite these benefits, U.S. cities have traditionally had low levels of bicycle mode share compared to their international counterparts. Because of this low level of traditional utilization, bicycle commuting has the potential to have a large impact on traffic congestion in metropolitan areas. This analysis examines traffic congestion and bicycle commuting mode share in 99 cities over 5 years to determine to what extent, if any, bicycle mode share can decrease vehicular congestion. By analyzing data from the Texas A&MTransportation Institute as well as the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey, a sizeable and in some cases significant reduction in congestion can be observed in cities with higher levels of bicycle mode share. Policy makers can use these findings to advocate for increased investment in bicycle infrastructure and pro-bicycle policies. Through these methods, reductions in congestion can be achieved for a fraction of the cost of increased vehicular infrastructure.",2013,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: The effect of bicycle mode-share on congestion delays in U.S. metropolitan areas from 2005-2010 ISBN: 9781303034411 ISSN: 0898-9095 Issue: 5 Volume: 51,,,,,Metropolitan areas; Policy sciences; Political planning; Pollution; Public policy; Texas; Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis responds to these needs by developing a new Tool for Air Pollution Scenarios (TAPS) and applying it to example policy effects on emissions, health impacts, and alternative metrics that are consistent with a stock-based sustainability framework of inclusive wealth. In Chapter 2, we develop and implement TAPS with three components: recent global anthropogenic emissions inventories, emitting activity scenarios from the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis model, and emissions intensity trends based on recent scenario data from the Greenhouse Gas - Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies model. Initial results show the limits of existing policy and the importance of different policy levers for different pollutants - including climate action to reduce fossil fuel related air pollutants (such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides), and other air quality controls to reduce pollutants such as ammonia and organic carbon. Chapter 3 connects the tool's emissions results to health impacts, focusing on the difference between two pollution control scenarios under the common assumption that the Paris Agreement's climate targets are met. We find major differences in ambient fine particulate matter concentrations as well as impacts on premature mortality and morbidity - showing that climate action alone does not guarantee a clean-air future. We also find distributional differences between different measures of national impacts, especially when comparing standard or monetized health endpoints with our alternative that focuses on healthy life years. Finally, Chapter 4 concludes wit h future considerations for scenario development, analytical choices, and stakeholder considerations for integrating the health impacts of air pollution into sustainability decisions.",2022,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Quantifying a range of global air pollution projections and health impacts under the Paris Agreement's Temperature Targets,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation investigates battery degradation, and how the introduction of PHEVs may influence the electricity grid, emissions, and petroleum use in the US. It examines the effects of combined driving and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) usage on the lifetime performance of relevant commercial Li-ion cells. The loss of battery capacity was quantified as a function of driving days as well as a function of integrated capacity and energy processed by the cells. The cells tested showed promising capacity fade performance: more than 95% of the original cell capacity remains after thousands of driving days worth of use. Statistical analyses indicate that rapid vehicle motive cycling degraded the cells more than slower, V2G galvanostatic cycling. These data are used to examine the potential economic implications of using vehicle batteries to store grid electricity generated at off-peak hours for off-vehicle use during peak hours. The maximum annual profit with perfect market information and no battery degradation cost ranged from ∼US$140 to $250 in the three cities. If the measured battery degradation is applied, however, the maximum annual profit decreases to ∼$10–120. The dissertation details the increase in electric grid load and emissions due to vehicle battery charging in PJM and NYISO with the current generation mix, the current mix with a $50/tonne CO2 price, and this case but with existing coal generators retrofitted with 80% CO2 capture. It also models emissions using natural gas or wind+gas. PHEV fleet percentages between 0.4 and 50% are examined. When compared to 2020 CAFE standards, net CO2 emissions in New York are reduced by switching from gasoline to electricity; coal-heavy PJM shows somewhat smaller benefits unless coal units are fitted with CCS or replaced with lower CO2 generation. NOX is reduced in both RTOs, but there is upward pressure on SO2 emissions or allowance prices under a cap. Finally the dissertation compares increasing the all-electric range (AER) of PHEVs to installing charging infrastructure. Fuel use was modeled using the National Household Travel Survey and Greenhouse Gasses, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation model. It was found that increasing AER of plug-in hybrids was a more cost effective solution to reducing gasoline consumption than installing charging infrastructure. Comparison of results to current subsidy structure shows various options to improve future PHEV or other vehicle subsidy programs.",5/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:29,,,,,,,Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721085.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation provides a normative, descriptive, and prescriptive analysis of the design of such measures. Part I analyzes the normative foundations of the preference aggregation procedures that define societal preferences, concluding that conventional procedures represent a small subset of those that would be normatively permissible given conventional assumptions. Each aggregation procedure represents different ethical principles, reflecting differences in the treatment of preference heterogeneity, and Part I presents an analytical-deliberative framework for choosing among them. Part II describes the creation of a new HRQL measure, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Preference (PROPr) Scoring System. The PROPr Scoring System is a free, open-source tool that combines best practices in health profile measurement with those for creating preference-based scores. It is designed for integration with the PROMIS initiative of the National Institutes of Health, which is poised to become the U.S. standard for patient-reported outcomes. Part III characterizes the empirical relationships between exclusion criteria – meant to capture the data from preference surveys that are not true preferences – and the implications for those who choose to implement them. We show that conventions for data cleaning via exclusion criteria represent disparate mechanisms for exclusion, that exclusions impact the preference data available for analyses, and that exclusion likely affects the societal representativeness of the included preferences. We argue that there is sufficient empirical evidence to recommend only a subset of criteria, and describe procedures for implementing them in order to minimize wrongful exclusion. We outline future work to produce criteria with better classification properties and surveys that minimize the need for exclusion.",12/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Measurement of Health-Related Quality of Life,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720527.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9J5ULRGQ,thesis,2019,"Saulnier, Christopher R.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Beyond industry: an expanded definition of authentic engineering design education,,,,,,"Authentic approaches to design education are typically defined as experiences centered on industry involvement. This industry connection is commonly either in the form of projects provided by industry partners or practicing engineers that serve as mentors to students. After exploring the goals and current practices of design education, this dissertation proposes an expanded definition of authentic design education: any design project with impact beyond the classroom environment that encourages the development of a student's self-identity as an engineer. To investigate the potential benefits afforded by an expanded definition of authentic design, a new design class was developed, taught, and evaluated across four years. The class, entitled Design for the Wilderness, was developed with a focus on projects that have impact beyond the classroom environment. Students were required to design and build products that they relied on while traveling in remote wilderness environments. These impactful projects required students to experience the results of their design decisions. Building on our experiences implementing Design for the Wilderness, a curricular approach of Design for Use is introduced that requires students to use products developed by their peers. Design for Use helps increase students' understanding of human-centered design principles by encouraging students to confront the interplay between their intentions when designing a product and their experiences when failing to understand the intentions behind products designed by their peers. This dissertation also considers a mechanical engineering capstone design class (MIT's 2.009). An interesting outcome of this class is that some teams continue to work on commercializing their products after the semester ends. Team characteristics most strongly correlated with persisting on product development beyond the end of the class are related to healthy team dynamics and a positive social environment. Teams that persisted spent more of their time working together, had fewer teammates that worked significantly more or less than the team average, and spent more of their time simply ""hanging out"" in lab. Drawing on our findings from investigating multiple approaches to authentic design education, recommendations are made for the future development of effective engineering design classes.",2019,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,Beyond industry,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2019 Ph.D.,Book Title: Beyond industry : an expanded definition of authentic engineering design education,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior analyses have examined the potential for nuclear energy to play a role in decarbonizing the energy sector, one of the largest contributors to emissions worldwide. However, advanced, non-light water reactors, while often touted as a viable alternative for development, have languished. Large light water development projects have a repeated history of extended construction timelines, re-work delays, and significant capital risk. With few exceptions, large-scale nuclear projects have demonstrated neither affordability nor economic competitiveness, and are not well suited to nations with smaller energy grids, or to replace fossil generation in the industrial process heat sector. If nuclear power is to play a role in decarbonization, new policy and technical solutions will be needed. In this manuscript, we examine key aspects of past performance across the nuclear enterprise and explore the future potential of nuclear energy worldwide, focusing on policy and technical solutions that may be needed to move nuclear power forward as a part of a low-carbon energy future. We do so first at a high level, examining the history of nuclear power research and development in the United States, the nation that historically has led the way in the development of this generating technology. A significant portion of our analysis is focused on new developments in this technology – advanced non-light water reactors and small modular reactors. We find that while there are promising technical solutions available, improved funding and focus in research and new models of deployment may be needed if nuclear is to play a continuing or future role.

Additionally, the power sector is one of the largest contributors to increasing GHG atmospheric concentrations, and there is a pressing need to decarbonize the sector. Unfortunately, emerging economies in the Global South, where most of the electrification needs to happen, are some of the most vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change. Therefore, to achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 7 of universal electricity access, emerging economies will need to expand their electricity infrastructure while cutting emissions and adapting to climate change. Hydropower may be a low-carbon option to increase supply and decarbonize electricity generation. Unfortunately, climate change can affect hydropower operations through changes in the timing and magnitude of precipitation, rising temperatures, and glacier mass. Evaluating climate impacts on hydropower generally requires detailed local input data and hydrological models, which may not be available in many places of the Global South. Nevertheless, there is a pressing need to understand these impacts for future planning decisions. Research that focuses on developing flexible data requirement tools and models able to use climate projections and remotely sensed datasets for data-scarce regions is needed. Furthermore, identifying climate impacts and their potential risks on hydropower plants is just the first step towards the future adaptation of the hydropower sector. Communicating assessment results to relevant decision-makers will be crucial, yet effective communication tools for climate adaptation are still lacking. The objective of this dissertation was to characterize and understand the impacts of climate change on usable hydropower capacity in the Global South. First, I developed a hydrological model paired with a hydropower operations model to assess usable capacity at the power plant level in data-scarce regions of the world. Then, I used the model to analyze the changes in usable capacity in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru under a multi-model ensemble. Later, I used the same model across five African power pools. I expanded the initial assessment to incorporate changes in variability of hydropower resources in Africa; and generate interconnection scenarios based on the complementarities of these resources. The final piece of this dissertation consisted of creating an interactive analysis tool that includes all previous assessments and incorporated 56 more countries across five regions of the Global South.",9/9/22,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,,,,,,,Hydropower Vulnerability in a Changing Climate,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/20750161.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/GF9AHX2E/Caceres - 2022 - Hydropower Vulnerability in a Changing Climate Characterizing Future Risks in the Global South.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation explores the institutional and innovation strategies that firms consider when governments regulate technology features in such nascent markets. This research looks at a global emerging market with multiple combinations of product features — the global commercial drone industry. Through this empirical context, this dissertation addresses three distinct questions: (1) how does government institutional support impact firm establishment? (2) how do institutional carriers impact the experimentation of product features? (3) how do regulatory standard changes impact the framing of new products? In Chapter 2, I study the infrastructure that can help explain the emergence of experimental markets (e.g., markets with both unclear institutional and technological trajectories). The Chinese commercial drone industry is an indicative example of such a market. I find that market-input infrastructure that clarifies the know-how needed for inputs has a greater association with upstream founding (component firms). Market-output infrastructure that clarifies market fit for resulting products has a greater association with downstream founding (end product firms). These effects are substitutive; local governments focus only on one of these forms of market infrastructure to reduce the risks involved in such experimentation and to reduce competition with other cities. Finally, institutional infrastructure that clarifies the rules increase founding, especially in cities with more aforementioned market infrastructure. In Chapter 3, I examine how formal standards (regulative institutional factors), industry consortia (normative institutional factors), and knowledge providers (cognitive institutional factors) interact to differentially impact observed firm product features. The drone industry around precision agriculture is a heavily regulated yet nascent market that serves as a useful context to explore the product innovation process. I test the interaction between these three institutional factors on product innovation using panel data of 464 newly introduced drone platforms targeted at precision agriculture sector that were released between 2000 to 2021. While regulatory standards do lead to convergence in product features, local institutional carriers play a key role in either enhancing or acting against such convergence. Firms located near industry consortia tend to experiment less and align with the emerging standard, whereas firms located near knowledge providers tend to experiment more and diverge from the emerging standard. While accounting for regulations is crucial, managers may find looking at how local institutional carriers respond to standard trends important in how they modulate product design choices. In Chapter 4, I investigate how firms navigate regulatory uncertainties in the U.S. consumer drone industry, where competing conventions co-exist: appropriateness vis-à-vis regulation vs. vis-à-vis market. Using 2,796 repeated observations of 466 small drones listed on the Amazon marketplace from 2013 to 2018, this study explores the impact of product framing strategies (framing to regulation, to market, or both) on product performance. The findings suggest that both framing around regulation and market have a positive effect on product market performance, but these effects are substitutive. Specifically, framing around regulation has a positive effect on market performance after a shift in regulation, while framing around market has a positive effect prior to the shift in regulation. By recognizing the impact of different framing strategies on market performance, entrepreneurs can gain valuable insight into when to pivot their product framing choices and product features in the face of regulatory uncertainty. The concluding chapter summarizes the findings of this dissertation and presents practical recommendations that emanate from these findings for regulators and managers seeking to adopt new technologies in the face of both market and regulatory uncertainty. Policymakers in such markets should consider more carefully the market nuances and tradeoffs when introducing regulatory standards. While introducing such standards can legitimize the market and promote entrepreneurship therein, these standards may also hinder subsequent product innovation in such a market. As such, policymakers need to be attuned to the stage of development in the market when pondering what standards to issue and when. Coordinating with local institutional carriers such as industry associations, national labs, science parks and universities specialized in certain domain knowledge could potentially mitigate these negative innovation impacts. On the other hand, firms need to consider the benefits and weaknesses of proximate institutional carriers in their location as they craft product design and market entry strategies. Additionally, the introduction of standards will influence the performance of different product framings, so firms need to adapt their framing strategies in ways that align with regulatory changes. <pre><code><br></code></pre>",2023,5/20/25 15:35,5/20/25 15:35,5/20/25 15:35,4479949 Bytes,,,,,,The Effects of Government Regulation on Entrepreneurship and Product Innovation in Nascent Markets,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 4479949 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to prepare university students with competencies for the twenty-first century, a holistic and deep understanding of the development of students’ competencies in university education is imperative to enable more appropriate and effective university education. This study aimed to explore university students’ perceptions on core competencies for the twenty-first century, including their perceptions on the importance of the core competencies, the self-assessment of owning the core competencies, and the perceived adequacy of university education in preparing them with core competencies. A mixed methods research design was adopted with both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The quantitative design was the dominant method used, in which a cross-sectional survey using a self-report questionnaire of 40 Likert-type items was used to collect data from 5,042 university students from Macau and Zhejiang Province in China. Since these two locations are under the different education system and Higher Education Act (Macau is a Special Administrative Region in China), this study called them as ‘two Chinese societies’. The questionnaire comprised three subscales, namely, Importance, Possession, and Adequacy. The qualitative approach was purposively set as supplements to the quantitative results, in which four focus-group interviews with university students and eight face-to-face interviews with university teachers were conducted. All the participants are public university students and teachers from Zhejiang Province and Macau. Analysis with the Rasch rating scale model found that in each subscale, the data fit the Rasch model well, the reliability of the scale was good, and substantial differential item functioning was detected by gender and location respectively. The analysis gave a profile of university students’ perceptions on the importance of competencies for the twenty-first century, self-ratings on these competencies, the perceived adequacy of university education in cultivating these competencies, and the relationships between these three aspects of students’ perceptions. The results found that students attached great importance to almost all core competencies listed in the questionnaire, perceived themselves as having acquired many of these competencies to some extent, and considered their universities to be effective in developing most of the competencies explored in this study. The qualitative interviews with university students and teachers supported the quantitative survey. Students’ perceptions on the importance of core competencies have moderate correlations with self-assessments and the perceived adequacy of university education (0.76 and 0.62, respectively), while self-assessments and the perceived adequacy of university education have low associations (0.24). No substantial differences in gender, grade and location were found in the students’ perceptions on these three aspects. Based on these findings, some discussions were conducted in which the importance of the students’ role was emphasised in determining the development of core competencies in the students themselves, and implications of how to select and develop core competencies for twenty-first century university education in Chinese university students were suggested.",2015,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,Core competencies for the twenty-first century university education,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Core competencies for the twenty-first century university education: An investigation into students' perceptions in two Chinese societies ISBN: 9781339184531,,,,,Educational psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9RQYA4WG,thesis,2023,"Sun, Yi; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Algorithmic fairness in sequential decision making,,,,,,"Machine learning algorithms have been used in a wide range of applications, and there are growing concerns about the potential biases of those algorithms. While many solutions have been proposed for addressing biases in predictions from an algorithm, there is still a gap in translating predictions to a justified decision. Moreover, even a justified and fair decision could lead to undesirable consequences when decisions create a feedback effect. While numerous solutions have been proposed for achieving fairness in one-shot decision-making, there is a gap in investigating the long-term effects of sequential algorithmic decisions. In this thesis, we focus on studying algorithmic fairness in a sequential decision-making setting We first study how to translate model predictions to fair decisions. In particular, given predictions from black-box models (machine learning models or human experts), we propose an algorithm based on the classical learning-from-experts scheme to combine predictions and generate a fair and accurate decision. Our theoretical results show that approximate equalized odds can be achieved without sacrificing much regret. We also demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on real data sets commonly used by the fairness community. In the second part of the thesis, we study if enforcing static fair decisions in the sequential setting could lead to long-term equality and improvement of disadvantaged groups under a feedback loop. In particular, we model the interaction between algorithmic decisions and underlying distribution using Markov Decision Model with general transition functions. We propose a new metric that measures the distributional impact of algorithmic decisions as measured by the change in distribution's center, spread and shape. This metric categorizes the impact into within-group impact and between-group impact, where within-group impact measures how policies impact the distribution within a group, and between-group impact how policies impact the distributions of two population groups differently. Our results show that there is generally a trade-off between utility and between-group impact for threshold policies, and common fairness constraints could lead to ""backfire effects"" where the impact on groups could be disparate.",2023,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Algorithmic fairness in sequential decision making,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Chapter 2 I analyze four years of data (2012-2015) from the Generating Availability Data System (GADS) database maintained by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation(NERC) to evaluate key assumptions made by power system planners when determining capacity requirements. Using block subsampling and binomial modeling, I demonstrate that large unavailable capacity events have occurred with much greater frequency than should be expected if current-practice assumptions hold.In Chapter 3 I propose a nonhomogeneous Markov model to explain the observed correlated failures. I use logistic regression to fit a simple model specification that allows generator transition probabilities to depend on ambient temperatures and system load. I fit the model using 23 years of GADS data for the PJM Interconnection (PJM), the largest system operator by generation capacity in North America. Temperature and load are each statistically significant for two-thirds of generators. Temperature dependencies are observed in all generator types, but are most pronounced for diesel and natural gas generators at low temperatures and nuclear generators at high temperatures. The nonhomogeneous Markov model predicts system-level unavailable capacity substantially better thanthe homogeneous Markov model used currently by industry.In Chapter 4, joint work with Luke Lavin, I quantify the reliability risks implied by temperature dependence in PJM’s generator fleet. We modify an open-source resource adequacy modeling tool to allow generator availability to depend on temperature. We then parameterize the tool for PJM’s system using temperature-dependent forced outage rates developed in Chapter 3. We find that temperature dependence substantially increases capacity requirements to achieve the target level of reliability, though PJM procures still more than our model finds is required. Given the seasonality in temperatures and loads, we also demonstrate that average annual capacity requirements could be significantly reduced were PJM to set separate monthly targets, rather than a single annual target. Finally, we explore the resource adequacy implications of various future generator resource and climate change scenarios for PJM.",5/31/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/8204510.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/8T8N6DH8/Murphy - 2019 - Correlated Generator Failures and Power System Reliability.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9VY3WQNI,thesis,2015,"Du, Yichen; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Analysis on the impacts of electricity tariffs on the attractiveness of gas fired distributed combined heat and power systems,,,,,,"In order to achieve a more sustainable energy system, regulators and the industry are trying to balance among many challenging issues such as environmental concerns, economic efficiency and security of supply. In Europe, the environmental concerns are getting a higher weight in current discussions. While it is important to continue exploring the potential of renewables as well as other clean energy sources, finding a more effective way to utilize existing resources is also a viable solution. Combined heat and Power (CHP), also known as cogeneration, denotes a group of technologies that generate electricity and useful heat concurrently. Benefits of distributed CHP technologies arise from their direct connection to distribution and customer facilities, which can potentially alleviate transmission and distribution network constraints, lower network energy losses, improve system reliability, and result in CO2 emissions reductions and overall capital cost. This thesis focuses on understanding the technological, social and economic attractiveness of CHP technologies under different tariff designs, market conditions and incentives. It not only looks at the optimum economic value of CHP to individual customers, but also impacts on the system peak load and the environment. For that purpose, the thesis develops a methodology that focuses on analyzing customers' reactions to various exogenous parameters by looking at their CHP installation and operation decisions. Moreover, it adopts an overarching framework that integrates and streamlines the processes from simulation of customers' energy loads, representation of regulatory and market conditions, to the generation and interpretation of the installation and operations decisions. Results suggest that many distributed CHP technologies could bring positive economic value to the customers even without considering incentives. In the meanwhile, metrics like CO2 emissions, overall efficiency and system peak reduction all improved with the introduction of NGDCHPs. These observations confirm that NGDCHP systems have the potential to reduce costs at both the individual customers' level and at the system level. Moreover, we find that customers' decisions are noticeably influenced by the tariffication and incentive methods. Volumetric-only tariffs suffer from potential cross-subsidization and insufficient remuneration for network companies, but encourage higher utilization rate and installations because of the higher variable electricity price. In comparison, breaking down the electricity prices based on different cost drivers could send the correct economic signals to the customers while still meeting the sustainability principle for tariff designs. Additionally, we find that changing market conditions can have significant effects on the economic value of CHP systems installed on-site, and the annual savings are most sensitive to electricity purchase prices. In conclusion, the goal of this research is to explore the value of gas fired distributed CHP systems under different settings. It informs the private sector as well as the policymakers by how to realize the potential benefits of distributed CHP systems. In the future, the methodology and framework developed in this thesis could be further applied to analyze scenarios where distributed CHP penetration is high and is coupled with other distributed energy resources.",2015,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Analysis on the impacts of electricity tariffs on the attractiveness of gas fired distributed combined heat and power systems,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous literature on behavioral advertising has focused almost exclusively on privacy issues; there has been less study of how it might affect industry structure. This thesis examines which parties in the online advertising value chain would benefit the most from the demand for detailed behavioral data; in particular, it examines whether aggregators (such as advertising networks) that track behavior across a large number of websites would derive the greatest benefit. Qualitative stakeholder analysis is used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of several categories of actors: advertisers, advertising agencies, publishers, advertising networks, advertising exchanges, Internet service providers, and users. Advertising agencies might attempt to bypass networks and work directly with publishers, becoming aggregators in their own right. Publishers might need to become interactive ""information experiences"" in order to collect valuable behavioral data. Users might demand more transparency about what is happening with their data, or even more control over the data collection process. Overall, agencies, networks, and advertising exchanges appear to be in the best position; publishers are faced with a harder task. Furthermore, behavioral targeting may not result in a dramatic increase in overall online advertising spending.",2010,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,The Internet as recommendation engine,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: The Internet as recommendation engine : implications of online behavioral targeting,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy conservation are all commonly suggested solutions. Such interventions may provide health and environmental benefits by displacing emissions from conventional power plants. However, the generation mix varies considerably from region to region and emissions vary by the type and age of a generator. Thus, the benefits of an intervention will depend on the specific generators that are displaced, which vary depending on the timing and location of the intervention. Marginal emissions factors (MEFs) give a consistent measure of the avoided emissions per megawatt-­‐hour of displaced electricity, which can be used to evaluate the change in emissions resulting from a variety of interventions. This thesis presents the first systematic calculation of MEFs for the U.S. electricity system. Using regressions of hourly generation and emissions data from 2006 through 2011, I estimate regional MEFs for CO2, NOx, and SO2, as well as the share of marginal generation from coal-­‐, gas-­‐, and oil-­‐fired generators. This work highlights significant regional differences in the emissions benefits of displacing a unit of electricity: compared to the West, displacing one megawatt-­‐hour of electricity in the Midwest is expected to avoid roughly 70% more CO2, 12 times more SO2, and 3 times more NOx emissions. I go on to explore regional variations in the performance of wind turbines and solar panels, where performance is measured relative to three objectives: energy production, avoided CO2 emissions, and avoided health and environmental damages from criteria pollutants. For 22 regions of the United States, I use regressions of historic emissions and generation data to estimate marginal impact factors, a measure of the avoided health and environmental damages per megawatt-­‐ hour of displaced electricity. Marginal impact factors are used to evaluate the effects of an additional wind turbine or solar panel in the U.S. electricity system. I find that the most attractive sites for renewables depend strongly on one’s objective. A solar panel in Iowa displaces 20% more CO2 emissions than a panel in Arizona, though energy production from the Iowa panel is 25% less. Similarly, despite a modest wind resource, a wind turbine in West Virginia is expected to displace 7 times more health and environmental damages than a wind turbine in Oklahoma. Finally, I shift focus and explore the economics of small-­‐scale cogeneration, which has long been recognized as a more efficient alternative to central-­‐station power. Although the benefits of distributed cogeneration are widely cited, adoption has been slow in the U.S. Adoption could be encouraged by making cogeneration more economically attractive, either by increasing the expected returns or decreasing the risks of such investments. I present a case study of a 300-­‐kilowatt cogeneration unit and evaluate the expected returns from: demand response, capacity markets, regulation markets, accelerated depreciation, a price on CO2 emissions, and net metering. In addition, I explore the effectiveness of feed-­‐in tariffs at mitigating the energy-­‐price risks to cogeneration projects.",8/1/12,5/20/25 17:38,5/20/25 17:38,5/20/25 17:38,,,,,,,Evaluating Interventions in the U.S. Electricity System,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716483.v1,,"/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/SQSN7HPC/Siler-Evans - 2012 - Evaluating Interventions in the U.S. Electricity System Assessments of Energy Efficiency, Renewable.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, the Chilean government, through the Agricultural Development Institute (INDAP), provides financial support for fostering entrepreneurship among small farmers to enable them to become more competitive in global markets. Despite this support, a declining number of farmers and an aging population are observed in rural areas. Most rural development programs focus on increasing competitiveness, whereas the stay-exit decision in agriculture is also affected by the characteristics and preferences of farmers and their families, and rural development policy. The overall objective of this dissertation was to provide technical and socioeconomic information for improving the effectiveness of rural development programs, which are seen as the tool for stopping rural migration. To accomplish this objective, first an analysis of the role of socioeconomic variables in the stay-exit decision in farming was made based on efficiency theory, exit barrier theory, and life-cycle theory. The association of potential factors with the stay-exit decision was identified using a probit model. This dissertation suggests that, besides the technical characteristics of the farming, which have been traditionally addressed in developing countries, rural development policies should focus on (i) farmer characteristics, i.e. age, gender, and expectations; (ii) farming system, i.e. multivariate production; and (iii) social aspect of rural society, i.e. membership of farmer associations. In addition, technical, economic, and social data was used to explore the scope for improving the technical efficiency of the sample farms and to identify the variables influencing technical efficiency. Two-stage models were performed to estimate (i) the technical efficiency and (ii) the input-specific technical inefficiency with which these farmers operate, and to identify the association of potential factors with either farm-level technical efficiency or input-specific technical inefficiency. Results for farm-level technical efficiency showed that farmers could reduce their input use by 30%. When measuring input-specific technical inefficiency results showed that the input use can be reduced by 26% (land use) to 37% (livestock use). This thesis also analyzed the effectiveness of existing rural development programs in Chile by comparing the opinions of experts regarding the effectiveness of these programs in achieving the main INDAP goals and the budget allocation among rural development programs. Results showed (i) a discrepancy between the allocation of the INDAP budget and the effectiveness of the rural development programs in achieving the overall INDAP goal; and (ii) that some INDAP programs are less effective in achieving INDAP goals. This suggested possibilities for reducing the current number of professional and technical advice programs and reallocating budget from less effective programs to programs that are more effective in the achievement of INDAP goals. Hence, designing new programs that focus on improving the quality of social and organizational capital could increase the achievement of INDAP goals.",2016,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Improving the Effectiveness of Rural Development Policy in Chile ISBN: 9798380565400,,,,,Agricultural education; Agriculture; Businesspeople; Cities and towns; Data envelopment analysis; Developing countries; Economic development; Economics; Education; Employment; Entrepreneurship; Farmers; Grain; Industrial relations; International relations; International trade; Livestock; Metropolitan areas; Rural development; Subsidies; Wage-price policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This data has the potential for enabling new insights that can change the way business, science, and governments deliver services to their consumers and can impact society as a whole. This has led to the emergence of the Big Data Computing paradigm focusing on sensing, collection, storage, management and analysis of data from variety of sources to enable new value and insights. To realize the full potential of Big Data Computing, we need to address several challenges and develop suitable conceptual and technological solutions for dealing them. Today's and tomorrow's extreme-scale computing systems, such as the world’s fastest supercomputers, are generating orders of magnitude more data by a variety of scientific computing applications from all disciplines. This dissertation addresses several big data challenges at extreme scales. First, we quantitatively studied through simulations the predicted performance of existing systems at future scales (for example, exascale 1018 flops). Simulation results suggestedthat current systems would likely fail to deliver the needed performance at exascale. Then, we proposed a new system architecture and implemented a prototype that was evaluated on tens of thousands nodes on par with the scale of today's largest supercomputers. Micro benchmarks and real-world applications demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed architecture: the prototype achieved up to two orders of magnitude higher data movement rate than existing approaches. Moreover, the system prototype was incorporated with features that were not well supported in conventional systems, such as distributed metadata management, distributed caching, lightweight provenance, transparent compression, acceleration through GPU encoding, and parallel serialization. Towards exploring the proposed architecture at millions of node scales, simulations were conducted and evaluated with a variety of workloads, showing near linear scalability and orders of magnitude better performance than today's state-of-the-art storage systems.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Big data system infrastructure at extreme scales ISBN: 9781339224152,,,,,Computer science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A56TE62Y,thesis,2015,Putbrese Benjamin L; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,Exploring design and policy options for orbital infrastructure projects,,,,,,"The space industry is currently at a significant inflection point. New economies are forming in low- Earth orbit (LEO), driven by miniaturization of technologies and the promise of lower launch costs, which should then allow many of these LEO systems to capitalize on designs incorporating smaller, shorter-lived spacecraft in highly-disaggregated constellations. Meanwhile, many spacecraft at geosynchronous orbit are continuing along a trend towards increasingly massive and longer-lasting satellites, and while they do represent some of the most exquisite, highest-performing satellites ever launched, some experts now feel that such trends are unsustainable and are beginning to place increasing strain on the underlying industry. To support current and future spacecraft, orbital infrastructures have been proposed as a means of providing on-orbit services to customer spacecraft and guiding space architectures towards more sustainable paradigms. In LEO, an infrastructure of communications and data relay spacecraft is envisioned as a means of aiding new and existing space enterprises in the areas of satellite connectivity and downlink capability. Meanwhile, an on-orbit servicing (OOS) infrastructure, located primarily in geosynchronous orbit, would provide services such as repair, rescue, refueling, and upgrading of customer spacecraft, in order to alleviate the identified space industry trends. Physics and cost modeling, as well as tradespace exploration, are used to identify optimal LEO infrastructure designs, while system dynamics modeling is used to assess the trends likely to occur in the overall space industry as OOS is incorporated into space architectures. The primary conclusion from the analysis of LEO infrastructure designs is that, when designing for global connectivity, there is an optimal design point between a small constellation of larger spacecraft and a very large constellation of small spacecraft, but this will also depend on the intended mission of the infrastructure and the number of customers expecting to be serviced. Then, for an OOS infrastructure, it is determined that relatively low costs and heavy incorporation of servicing capabilities into customer architectures are needed to ensure long-term sustainability of such a project. Finally, the policy implications for both infrastructure concepts are discussed, with a heavy focus on options for the funding and development regimes employed to implement the infrastructures, as well as the major political and legal implications expected to accompany these projects.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Exploring design and policy options for orbital infrastructure projects,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the characteristics of renewable energy resources differ greatly from conventional energy resources. Integrating large quantities of renewable resources therefore warrants enhancements and modifications to current practices as the current Indian power system lacks sufficient operational services that protect the grid against contingencies. This dissertation aims to analyze the operational and flexibility needs of the Indian grid to accommodate diverse and new energy sources. The first part of the dissertation analyzes the operational issues in the current power system. The Indian power system is restricted to a few services to support grid operation, which is primarily balancing demand and supply, in real-time. The different enhancements to the current balancing mechanism have varying impacts on the demand and supply balance, and this is reflected in the grid frequency. Therefore, the grid frequency under different balancing mechanism is modeled to understand the impacts. The results indicate that improving primary frequency response from generators along with a revision of the current prices is the most effective strategy. Next, given the current conditions that exist in the grid, a feasible load balancing mechanism is analyzed to understand the related benefits and costs. While the first part of the dissertation analyzes grid level impacts of different balancing mechanisms, the second part explores a service that should be implemented by the electric system operator to support grid balancing. The results indicate that the proposed mechanism is beneficial in reducing real-time emergency events by 55% at a power purchase cost increase of 3.5%. In addition to services, the system operators and regulators must ensure that there are sufficient flexible resources that can support the variability and uncertainty in the grid. The third part of the dissertation analyzes the impact of different generation scenarios on power system operation and reliability. The section highlights the need for flexible resources to counter the uncertainty and variability of renewable energy resources. In essence, the dissertation aims to encourage a rigorous approach to planning and policy making with regards to renewable energy integration.",5/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Enabling the Future Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716231.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AB96YNX6,thesis,2014,"Srivastava, Kumar Abhinav; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; System Design and Management Program; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",Assessing financial well-being of merchants by analyzing behavioral patterns in historical transactions,,,,,,"This study focuses on new approach to estimate financial wellbeing indicators for merchants, by looking at behavioral patterns of their customers in historical transactions. The transaction data for about 10,000 merchants in a specific country, was analyzed in terms of their diversity and propensity of customers for factors like age, distance they travel to shop, time of the day, day of the week, educational status, gender etc. While diversity refers to the variety in the different groups, propensity refers to concentration of customers in specific groups. These factors were used as independent variables to predict the financial well-being of merchants, particularly in two dimensions -total revenue and consistency in revenue, both relative to other merchants in the same industry. The merchants were also divided into the categories of Essential, Nonessential and Luxury goods depending on the industry they belong to and it was interesting to observe the contrast across categories. While the individual correlations were weak but significant, feature selection and classification (using logistic regression) indicate that diversity and propensity for factors of 'Age', 'Time of the day' and 'Day of the week' show reasonable prediction capabilities for total revenue and consistency in revenue for a merchant, as compared to the industry average. These kind of inputs can be very useful from a bank's perspective if an existing business customer of a bank wants to apply for a loan and the bank needs to assess the application. The analysis can be a good augmentation to the current methods or models of determining the financial wellbeing of a merchant. Also, this kind of analysis can bring a fresh perspective to the merchants to look at the customer base and then to target the right customers for achieving the business objectives of above average and consistent revenue streams.",2014,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, System Design and Management Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis SD&M 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Assessing financial well-being of merchants by analyzing behavioral patterns in historical transactions,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; System Design and Management Program; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABCZEBKP,thesis,2013,"Fertig, Emily",Facilitating the Development and Integration of Low-Carbon Energy Technologies,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Facilitating_the_Development_and_Integration_of_Low-Carbon_Energy_Technologies/6716621/1,"Climate change mitigation will require extensive decarbonization of the electricity sector. This thesis addresses both large-scale wind integration (Papers 1-3) and development of new energy technologies (Paper 4) in service of this goal. Compressed air energy storage (CAES) could be paired with a wind farm to provide firm, dispatchable baseload power, or serve as a peaking plant and capture upswings in electricity prices. Paper 1 presents a firm-level engineering-economic analysis of a wind/CAES system with a wind farm in central Texas, load in either Dallas or Houston, and a CAES plant whose location is profit-optimized. Of a range of market scenarios considered, the CAES plant is found to be profitable only given the existence of large and infrequent price spikes. Social benefits of wind/CAES include avoided construction of new generation capacity, improved air quality during peak demand, and increased economic surplus, but may not outweigh the private cost of the CAES system nor justify a subsidy. Like CAES, pumped hydropower storage (PHS) ramps quickly enough to smooth wind power and could profit from arbitrage on short-term price fluctuations exacerbated by large-scale wind. Germany has aggressive plans for wind power expansion, and Paper 2 analyzes an investment opportunity in a PHS facility in Norway that practices arbitrage in the German spot market. Price forecasts given increased wind capacity are used to calculate profit-maximizing production schedules and annual revenue streams. Real options theory is used to value the investment opportunity, since unlike net present value, it accounts for uncertainty and intertemporal choice. Results show that the optimal investment strategy under the base scenario is to wait approximately eight years then invest in the largest available plant. Paper 3 examines long-distance interconnection as an alternate method of wind power smoothing. Frequency-domain analysis indicates that interconnection of aggregate regional wind plants across much of the western and mid-western U.S. would not result in significantly greater smoothing than interconnection within a single region. Time-domain analysis shows that interconnection across regions reduces the magnitude of low-probability step changes and doubles firm power output (capacity available at least 92 % of the time) compared with a single region. An approximate cost analysis indicates that despite these benefits, balancing wind and providing firm power with local natural gas turbines would be more cost-effective than with transmission interconnection. Papers 1 and 3 demonstrate the need for further RD&D (research, development, and deployment) of low-carbon energy technologies. Energy technology development is highly uncertain but most often modeled as deterministic, which neglects the ability both to adapt RD&D strategy to changing conditions and to invest in initially high-cost technologies with small breakthrough probabilities. Paper 4 develops an analytical stochastic dynamic programming framework in which RD&D spending decreases the expected value of the stochastic cost of a technology. Results for a two-factor cost model (which separates RD&D into R&D and learning-by-doing) applied to carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) indicate that given 15 years until large-scale deployment, investment in the RD&D program is optimal over a very broad range of initial mitigation costs ($10-$380/tCO2). While the NPV of the program is zero if initial mitigation cost is $100/tCO2, under uncertainty the program is worth about $7 billion. If initial mitigation cost is high, the program is worth most if cost reductions exogenous to the program (e.g. due to private sector activity) are also high. Factors that promote R&D spending over learning-by-doing include more imminent deployment, high initial cost, lower exogenous cost reductions, and lower program funds available.",5/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716621.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The uncertainty, complexity, and occasional novelty of complex and compound threats may necessitate adaptive capacity and adaptive decision-making at the individual and organizational levels. Adaptive capacity is defined as processes, actions, or outcomes in a system that facilitate coping, managing, and adjusting to changing conditions, stressors, or hazards. For both individuals and organizations, built and natural environmental conditions can influence vulnerability and adaptive capacity. This thesis explores the intersection of adaptive capacity and enacted adaptive decision-making and behaviors by considering both internal barriers and external stressors that challenge the willingness and ability to adapt to current threat landscapes. Adaptive capacity and adaptive decision-making are contingent on a variety of factors internal and external to individuals and organizations, such as knowledge and concern about threats and vulnerabilities, the willingness and ability to engage in proactive behaviors, and the capacity to change existing behaviors (i.e., emergent technology use). Examples of adaptive capacity assessed in the current thesis include individual-level use of multi-modal, sustainable transportation modes (Chapter 1), compound threat management strategies and constraints (i.e., incident prioritization, availability and use of emergent technology adoption, use of decision support tools) (Chapter 2), and compound threat resource allocation (Chapter 3). Both quantitative and qualitative data are used to assess adaptive capacity, including quantitative surveys, qualitative data from semi-structured interviews, and quantitative historical data records of natural hazards. This thesis emphasized the relationship between adaptive capacity and resource availability, particularly in the context of chronic and/or compound threats. Findings across the three analytical chapters suggest that the availability of and access to resources alone is insufficient in capturing individual and organizational adaptive behavior. In addition to tangible resources, psycho-social factors such as personal experience, competing objectives, and risk perception and communication can constraint adaptive capacity. Chapters 2 and 3 focus on challenges presented by a variety of compounding threats, which are anticipated to increase in frequency, severity, and complexity moving forward. Overall, results focus on U.S. adaptive capacity of communities and federal hazard management agencies, who serve to help communities prepare for, respond to, recover from, and adapt to stressors and disruptions in the natural and built environments. Findings from Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 suggest that it is critical to support the essential hazard management workforce to adapt to compound threat events, particularly given the resource constraints and mental health concerns discussed in Chapter 2 and resource use implications presented in Chapter 3.",2023,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,4483386 Bytes,,,,,,Explorations of Adaptive Resource Use and Technology Choice,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 4483386 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science; 50205 Environmental Management; FOS: Earth and related environmental sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this fact, almost no research has been done on their levels of disaster preparedness. In this dissertation, I use mixed quantitative and qualitative methods to explain variation in the levels of disaster preparedness among CBOs. My goal is to understand which organizational characteristics are highly correlated with disaster preparedness and which characteristics seem to have no effect on preparedness. By doing so, I hope to help CBOs—and therefore their clients—become better prepared for disasters. To complete my dissertation, I rely on data I helped gather while working as a Graduate Research Assistant on BayPrep, a joint research project of the University of Colorado Natural Hazards Center and the Fritz Institute. I utilize factor analysis to condense numerous measures of disaster preparedness into a manageable number of artificial dimensions known as factors. Then, I construct multivariate regression models that examine the effects of organizational characteristics on the previously generated disaster preparedness factors. Finally, I enrich and validate my quantitative results with the qualitative data I gathered while conducting in-depth interviews with the executives of the CBOs in this study. I conclude with a discussion of ways that my research can help CBOs become better prepared for natural disasters as well as important questions that my findings raise about the socio-economic structure of society.",2010,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,Surviving the next disaster,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Surviving the next disaster: Assessing the preparedness of community-based organizations ISBN: 9781109779660 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 6 Pages: 2235 Volume: 71,,,,,Colorado; Community organization; Disasters; Emergency management; Executives; Natural disasters; Organizational behavior; Social structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AEFMVJVA,thesis,2016,"Tong, Fan","The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Economic and Environmental Implications of Using Natural Gas to Power On-Road Vehicles in the United States",,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/The_Good_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly_Economic_and_Environmental_Implications_of_Using_Natural_Gas_to_Power_On-Road_Vehicles_in_the_United_States/6723605/1,"Currently, in the United States, on-road vehicles are primarily powered by petroleum fuels (gasoline and diesel). These vehicles have caused serious climate change effects from emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) and health and environmental impacts from criteria air pollutant (CAP). The recent success of shale gas development has brought industry interest in using natural gas to power on-road vehicles. In addition to low costs and wide availability of this national fuel source, natural gas is a common feedstock to produce alternative fuels. The question arises of whether using natural gas for transportation could help or hinder the environment. In this dissertation, I study the economic and environmental effects of a wide range of natural gas fuel pathways for a selection of light duty (LDV) and medium and heavy duty (MHDV) vehicle types. I choose to focus on two environmental metrics: GHGs and CAPs emitted over the life cycle of each potential pathway for natural gas use. First in Chapters 2 and 3, I use life-cycle analysis to understand the emissions of GHGs from different natural gas pathway for LDVs and MHDVs. Then in Chapter 4 I focus on the CAP emissions from these vehicles. Overall, I find that none of the natural gas pathways eliminate life cycle air emissions. In fact, only a few pathways reduce life cycle GHG emissions and/or life cycle air pollution damages compared to baseline petroleum fuels (gasoline for light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and diesel for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs)). For the cases of light duty vehicles (LDVs) and transit buses, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) powered by natural gas-based electricity provide significant reduction in life cycle GHG emissions and life cycle air pollution damages (for almost all counties) compared to the baseline petroleum fuels. However, the actual electricity that charges BEVs may not be natural gas-based electricity in most parts of the U.S. When powered by U.S. grid electricity (using average emission factors for 2010 and 2014), BEVs reduce life cycle GHG emissions to a lesser extent but increase life cycle air pollution damages significantly. Compressed natural gas (CNG), while reducing GHG emissions and CAP emissions (except CO) at tailpipe, are more likely to increase life cycle GHG emissions and increase life cycle air pollution damages in the majority of U.S. counties. For heavy-duty trucks, CNG sparking-ignition (SI) trucks and liquefied natural gas (LNG) high-pressure direct ignition (HPDI) trucks have mixed environmental impacts. While they are unlikely to reduce life cycle GHG emissions compared to diesel, they reduce life cycle air pollution damages in 76-99% of U.S. counties for local-haul tractor-trailers and in 32-71% of U.S. counties for long-haul tractor-trailers. In Chapters 5 and 6, I examine the economic impacts of natural gas fuel pathways for two vehicle types, tractor-trailers and transit buses. I study the economic feasibility of a national natural gas refueling infrastructure for long-haul trucks in U.S., which is a prerequisite for natural gas tractor-trailers. I find that a transition to natural gas fuels in long-haul trucks is more expensive when the shares of natural gas trucks are below 5% because of low refueling demands and over-capacity of the refueling infrastructure to ensure network coverage. At higher shares of natural gas trucks, both the total refueling capacity and the net economic benefits of the national refueling infrastructure increase almost linearly as adoption increases. Finally, in Chapter 6, I provide an economic-technology assessment for transit buses by considering both life cycle ownership costs and life cycle social costs due to GHG emissions and CAP emissions. Transit buses are early adopters of alternative fuel technologies because of funding supports and operation characteristics (such as high fuel consumption and private refueling infrastructure). I find that the availability of external funding is crucial for transit agencies to adopt any alternative fuel option. Without external funding, only rapid-charging battery electric buses (BEBs) have lower ownership & social costs than conventional diesel buses. When external funding is available to reduce bus purchase costs by 80%, BEBs become much more cost-effective. In this case, life cycle ownership and social costs of BEBs are 37-43% lower than conventional diesel buses. Including life cycle social costs does not change the ranking of alternative fuel options. The findings in this dissertation suggest different strategies of using natural gas for different vehicle markets. Natural gas is best used in electric power generation than to produce gaseous or liquid fuels for powering on-road LDVs. The use of CNG and LNG for heavy-duty trucks may continue as there are less alternative fuel options but issues such as methane leakage should be addressed to avoid important climate change effect. Finally, natural gas-based transportation fuels can at best partially mitigate climate change or air pollution damages, so other mitigation strategies in the transportation sector are ultimately needed to achieve sustainable transportation.",12/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly",,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723605.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AFFHIILR,thesis,2012,"Thomas, Brinda Ann",Energy Efficiency and Rebound Effects in the United States: Implications for Renewables Investment and Emissions Abatement,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Energy_Efficiency_and_Rebound_Effects_in_the_United_States_Implications_for_Renewables_Investment_and_Emissions_Abatement/6716243/1,"By lowering the energy required to provide a service, energy efficiency can help society consume less energy, emit less CO2e and other air pollutants, while maintaining quality of life. In this work, I examine a key benefit of energy efficiency, reducing renewables investment costs, and a side-effect, expanding energy service demand, also known as the rebound effect. First, I assess the economics of an energy efficiency intervention, using dedicated direct current (DC) circuits to operate lighting in commercial buildings. I find that using DC circuits in grid-connected PV-powered LED lighting systems can lower the total unsubsidized capital costs by 4% to 21% and levelized annual costs by 2% to 21% compared to AC grid-connected PV LEDs providing the same level of lighting service. I also explore the barriers and limitations of DC circuits in commercial buildings. Second, I examine the rebound effect from residential energy efficiency investments through a model in which households re-spend energy expenditure savings from an efficiency investment on more of the energy service (direct rebound) or on other goods and services (indirect rebound). Using U.S. household expenditure data and environmentally-extended input-output analysis, I find indirect rebound effects in CO2e emissions of 5-15%, depending on the fuel saved and assuming a 10% direct rebound. Third, I examine the variation in the indirect rebound from electricity efficiency across U.S. states due to differences in electric grid mix, fuel prices, household income, and spending patterns. I find that the CO2e direct and indirect rebound effects vary across states between 6-40%, when including full supply chain emissions, and between 4-30% when including only combustion and electricity emissions. I conclude that energy efficiency can provide significant benefits for reducing energy expenditures, CO2e and other pollutants, and renewables investment costs under policy mandates, even after accounting for the rebound effect. While the CO2e rebound effect is currently modest in the U.S., there are some exceptions that may be relevant for energy efficiency policy assessments. In addition, more data collection and measurements of direct rebound effects are needed, especially in developing countries where the demand for energy services has not fully been met.",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:26,,,,,,,Energy Efficiency and Rebound Effects in the United States,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716243.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since these AI tools rely on stochastic generation rather than traditional scientific reasoning, concerns about misinformation and reliability have emerged, highlighting the need for AI detection tools and policy guidelines. In response, this study proposes a dual approach: (1) the application of adaptive thresholds to improve the use of AI text detectors and (2) an AI policy framework based on user patterns and opinions. To enhance detector performance, we present a threshold optimization algorithm that adapts to diverse subgroups, such as those based on text lengths and stylistic features, thereby reducing discrepancies in error rates. The commonly used method relies on a single universal threshold, which has led to inconsistent results across various text types because of different probability distributions. Our approach addresses these shortcomings by tailoring thresholds to the specific characteristics of each group. In parallel, the study examines the pressing need for comprehensive AI guidelines, given the rise of misinformation and academic integrity issues. While a few institutions have introduced comprehensive policies, many institutes lack approaches grounded in user patterns and opinions. To remedy this problem, we propose a policy framework based on a user study.

ALECP4YN,thesis,2013,"Hernandez Inzunza, Sunner Daniela",The politics of gender and violence: A case study of a Mexican female senator and a law for victims of violence,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1370781827?pq-origsite=primo,"Violence against Mexican women is not a new subject. Disappearances and murdered women in the border town of Cd. Juarez and throughout the country are reported in the news headlines every day. Between 1999 and 2005 more than 6,000 women and girls were murdered, an average of 1,000 murdered women every year. The majority of the deaths result from violence within their household (Mexico, 2009). The rate of violence is not isolated to border towns. The Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas y Geografía (National Institute of Statistics and Geography/INEGI) reports that 67% of Mexican women aged 15 years of age and older have been victims of violence. At the same time, the political representation of Mexican women has increased over the years. The rate of Mexican women who hold national political positions is 35%, higher than most of its neighboring countries (Women, 2013). This thesis will focus on the representation of women at the federal level. Even though political representation numbers are significant compared to other nation states, Mexico ranks high in the Gender Inequality Index measured by the United Nations, signifying that Mexican women hold a poor position in their society. The relationship between the high incidence of violence against women and the number of elected female politicians is contradictory. This thesis will look at the effectiveness of Mexican female politicians in creating policies against violence and aims to answer these questions: 1) To what extent do women politicians follow party lines and to what extent do women politicians have autonomous agendas? 2) To what extent do women politicians get to participate in policy making and what role do quotas play in female participation? 3) Are Mexican female politicians writing and advocating effective legislation against violence? 4) What are some of the challenges and barriers in passing legislation against violence? I approach these questions using quantitative and qualitative methods through two case studies, data analysis, and narrative reports. I frame these questions around representation and critical mass theory. The first case study analyzes whether female PRI Senator Diva Gastelum represents her constituents through descriptive or substantives representation. The second case study analyzes the Ley General de Victimas (General Law for Victims/LGV), a piece of victim's assistance legislation and the role of female politicians. This inquiry will help the reader understand whether a relationship between Mexican female politicians and policies created against violence exists.",2013,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,The politics of gender and violence,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: The politics of gender and violence: A case study of a Mexican female senator and a law for victims of violence ISBN: 9781303103766 ISSN: 0898-9095 Issue: 6 Volume: 51,,,,,Females; Legislation; Mexico; Political science; Politicians; Representative government and representation; Victims; Violence; Women's studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first part of this thesis looks at nuclear energy in the U.S., while the second part examines the pursuit of decarbonization through decentralized micro-grids.The thesis begins by examining the possibility of a U.S. domestic market for factory-manufactured small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) being developed through the use of hybrid water-energy systems. This work found that the use of the proposed hybrid system will not likely lead to the mass market needed to facilitate the mass manufacturing of SMRs. On the electricity side, these hybrid systems powered by SMRs are not cost competitive in the U.S. against similar low carbon technologies like natural gas equipped with carbon capture and sequestration (NGCCS). On the water side, I conclude that the need for water desalination over the next several decades in the U.S. will not be large enough to support the mass SMR market I was searching for. However, there might exist substantial markets in arid countries where natural gas prices exceed 12 $/mscf and where there is a strong desire to adopt nuclear power.Chapter 3 investigates the perceptions of nuclear power as supported by existing theories on differing nuclear perspectives. Our survey participants held significantly less favorable views about nuclear energy if they cited Chernobyl and Fukushima as noteworthy events that shaped their perception. I found that Chernobyl has the most negative impact on participants, even for those who were not alive for the event. There was also a significant increase in negative views of nuclear energy in participants who would have been between the ages of 20 to 30 years old during Chernobyl, but these results do not extend to other events like Fukushima. The survey results also suggested that participants who are both non-white and non-male held significantly less favorable views compared to white males.Chapter 4 examines the trade-offs between decentralization and decarbonization in microgrid planning. A trade-off curve is produced by using a previously developed mixed-integer program (DER-CAM) in a multiobjective programming framework. The results include a range of microgrid designs with different technology mixes or typologies. As the weight on greenhouse gas emissions increases the associated costs rise; at the design that minimizes emissions, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the micro-grid rises to approximately 7x the current cost of electricity in southern California. Changes in natural gas (NG) prices do not change the micro-grid’s typology, but rather forces a quicker transition to low-carbon typologies. Every micro-grid developed in this chapter contained some amount of dispatchable distributed energy resource (DER), leading to an examination as to why a PV + storage only micro-grid would be unlikely. With the apparent need for micro-grids to contain some amount of distributable generation, a relatively small social cost of carbon of $50 per ton of CO2 ensures that every micro-grid would consist of primarily low-no emission DERs.",5/27/21,5/20/25 15:44,5/20/25 15:44,5/20/25 15:44,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/14666193.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/ULISDZQ5/Rath - 2021 - Future Pathways to U.S. Decarbonization Through Nuclear and Other Energy Systems.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
APET7KML,thesis,2015,"Lenhart, Jennifer",Urban Climate Governance: The Role of Local Authorities,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2565113264?pq-origsite=primo,"Cities are growing at unprecedented rates, home to over half of global population for the first time in history. While there are economic, environmental and other benefits to urban living, there are also consequences, among which cities' major contribution to climate change. Cities release greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including from energy consumption in buildings and infrastructure, transportation and industrial processes. Cities are also vulnerable to climate change, including exacerbated urban heat island (UHI) effect and flooding of non-porous surfaces during storm surges. Equally, cities are acting on climate change, adopting strategies to mitigate their GHG emissions, while preparing to adapt to a changing climate.Within this field of urban climate governance this dissertation examines the role of local authorities, and their interactions with stakeholders, to govern climate change mitigation and adaptation in cities. To do so, it develops a conceptual framework based on the governing capacities that local authorities employ, the governing modes they apply to address climate change, and how local authorities influence and are influenced by vertical and horizontal actors within a multilevel governance system. The main research question this study seeks to address is: How do forerunning local authorities govern climate change in a city, and how can their effects be improved? This research question is broken into three sub-research questions:How do forerunning local authorities draw upon capacities, and which governing capacities do they apply, to address climate change in a city?What governing modes do forerunning local authorities apply to address climate change?How can best practices in urban climate change governance be further improved within a particular city and diffused to other cities? These research questions are addressed by conducting a review study of urban climate governance in Dutch local authorities, followed by three case studies in cities deemed forerunners in urban climate governance. The three case study cities are: Malmö, Sweden and Amsterdam and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Each case study examines how local authorities interact with a specific stakeholder group to govern climate mitigation and adaptation related to a specific sector: city planning, energy in the build environment, urban agriculture and food.Methodologically, this dissertation employs a case study research design, using semistructured interviews, participant observation, and document analysis as its primary data collection methods. A specific question or hypothesis guides each study, including their respective methodology, data collection and analysis. This dissertation has six chapters: an introduction, four empirical studies and a conclusion.Chapter 2 conducts an overview of mitigation and adaptation strategies in the 25 largest local authorities in the Netherlands. Specifically it analyses the level of anchoring of climate strategies within policy, in local authorities' organisations and in their practical implementation. It also incorporates a multilevel governance lens to inspect the roles of national and European governing authorities and horizontal networks. This review assisted in the selection of two Dutch forerunners cities, used as case studies in chapters 4 and 5. The analysis reveals several trends: the decentralisation of climate strategies across municipal organisations; the externalisation of climate policies to non-municipal organisations; and the regionalisation of climate strategies, wherein local authorities collaborate with neighbouring municipalities. The Chapter concludes that in the absence of national support, local authorities partner with other stake- holders. Still, full anchoring of their climate strategies remains challenging without sufficient support from national/EU authorities, especially in smaller (less forerunning) local authorities.Chapter 3 investigates the inner functioning of a local authority organisation, focussing on city planning for climate governance in Malmö, Sweden. Specifically, it examines the role of learning and experimentation to address complex problems, such as climate change. The analysis reveals the importance of deliberate and structured methods to facilitate dialogue and collaboration, both across the departmental silos of a local authority, as well as with citizens and stakeholders, for the design and delivery of integrated climate strategies. In Malmö, this includes connecting climate strategies to the city's long-term vision and city planning to become a sustainable city. The Chapter concludes that by emphasising dialogue and collaboration, and by encouraging flexible methods to address complex problems, learning can become institutionalised, which in turn supports adaptive approaches to address climate change.Chapter 4 examines the interactions between a local authority with stakeholders in the build environment – such as architects, knowledge institutes, housing corporations and energy corporations – in the design of a new strategy to close resource-waste cycles. The study uses an urban symbiosis lens to analyse the Rotterdam Energy Approach and Planning (REAP). REAP combines urban planning and energy planning to capture waste energy sources, returning them for use in the city's energy grid. The study reveals the dominance of institutional actors in large-scale and technical climate strategies, while civil society engagement is largely absent. Secondly, private sector participation (e.g. energy companies, housing corporations) is limited in REAP's design phase, with only a limited number of local authority experts and representatives of knowledge institutes initially included. The Chapter concludes that earlier engagement of private sector stakeholders – those later tasked with project execution – already in the design phase is crucial for increasing their ownership and consequent successful project implementation.Chapter 5 explores the interactions between local authorities and civil society to address climate change. Specifically, it studies Amsterdam's food strategy and urban agricultural initiatives in relation to urban climate governance. While not often linked to local climate policy, urban agriculture has benefits for mitigation (e.g. local food reduces transport emissions) and adaptation (e.g. through preservation of green space). The case study examines how to combine top-down local authority support and bottom-up civil society engagement to integrate urban food strategies and urban agriculture to support climate strategies. The study reveals that while civil society engagement is imperative to address climate change, fragmentation might occur in the absence of central coordination, stagnating implementation of citizen-supported climate strategies. In conclusion the chapter suggests that a more explicit link between urban agriculture/ food strategies and climate strategies, as well as better coordination of civil society-local authority interactions, are vital to address climate change.Chapter 6 reflects on the dissertation's research questions and draws general conclusions vis-à-vis the governing capacities and governing modes local authorities utilise to facilitate urban climate governance. To engage climate strategies within forerunning cities, the case studies demonstrate a combination of central coordination and decentralised implementation – albeit to varying degrees of success in the different cases. They make use of structured dialogues to engage city departments and key stakeholders, and they allocate different resources to design and deliver climate strategies – the latter being imperative in a time of reduced financial and legal support from national authorities for urban climate governance by cities. In the face of uncertainty, both in terms of the complexity of climate change and the reduction of support, local authorities are moving increasingly towards the governing mode that is called 'governing by enabling'. Increasingly, local authorities are creating partnerships with different stakeholders to develop, implement, diffuse and improve their climate strategies. The contribution of this study to the urban climate governance literature lies in a better understanding of how local authorities in forerunning cities govern climate change. Their governing capacities and modes do engage strongly with different stakeholders, although in distinct ways in different cities and for different urban sectors.",2015,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,Urban Climate Governance,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Urban Climate Governance : The Role of Local Authorities ISBN: 9798728205081,,,,,"Botany; Greenhouse effect, Atmospheric; Horticulture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of these papers takes the perspective of the customer, where the value of the technology comes from reducing their electricity bill. In Chapter 2, I assess whether solar photovoltaics are economically viable without subsidies for residential customers across the United States. I calculate the break-even electricity prices and installation costs and find that, at a state level, solar PV is only currently economically attractive in Hawaii without the use of subsidies. In order for widespread adoption of solar PV, I illustrate how the availability of favorable financing terms, installation costs at or below $1.5/W, and the continuance of net energy metering policies are each critical. In Chapter 3, I create a case study to better understand solar PV economics for commercial and industrial customers, who collectively account for the majority of annual electricity sales in the United States. While residential customers are billed based on the total amount of energy they consume, commercial and industrial customers are also billed according to their greatest 15- minute energy use in a month with a demand charge. I analyze the net present value of a solar PV investment using both simulated and measured load and solar data for a variety of commercial customers in North and South Carolina. I identify key factors that influence economic viability and find that solar PV is not presently economically viable for these customers without subsidies, but will be once installation costs drop to below $1.25/W. In Chapter 4, I evaluate the economics of using energy storage to further reduce demand charges for each of the customers examined in Chapter 3. Using a “black-box” approach, I apply several generic energy storage technical attributes of a high-energy lithium-ion battery to assess the ideal performance and maximum economic benefit of energy storage. I find that batteries with lower capacities are most profitable for the commercial and industrial customers examined using an optimistic algorithm, but require further cost reductions using a pessimistic algorithm.",8/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716141.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employing panel data, I analyze three issues related to the diffusion of ICTs in the scientific communities of less developed areas: 1) access; 2) interaction; 3) and involvement. More specifically, I examine the way in which human capital, family structure, travel experiences, contextual factors, and technological antecedents interact with gender to influence access to and use of personal computers, email, and the Web. From there, I incorporate technological behavioral changes to predict interaction within professional networks. In the last step, I incorporate professional network measures to examine the gendered nature of research outcomes in the form of scientific productivity.The results suggest that over time ICTs have rapidly diffused within the three locations. At the same time, women continue to report less long-term access to email and the web. Furthermore, men and women are distinctly different in terms of intensity and extent of email and web use with women emerging as less technologically oriented. In spite of the differences on these measures, men are not earlier adopters of the technologies than women. It does not appear, however, that there is a consistent relationship between greater email use and integration within professional networks. Gender, on the other hand, emerges as one of the most consistent predictors of network outcomes, particularly in terms of absolute network size, geographic and gender diversity, and the proportion of male contacts reported.Finally, men and women are equally productive in domestic venues, but women are less productive in foreign venues. Furthermore, network structure is not as strongly related to productivity as are changes in technological use behavior. Respondents using email for a wider variety of reasons over time produce more in foreign and domestic venues, but intensity of email use is actually negatively related to productivity, suggesting that it is not technology use in general that matters when predicting outcomes, but the type of technology use. Network structure on the other hand, is only a significant predictor of domestic productivity.",2009,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,Women and Science in Development,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Women and Science in Development: A Longitudinal Analysis of Gender, Networks, and Information Technology in Ghana, Kenya, and India ISBN: 9798802775530",,,,,Behavior; Communication; Developing countries; Digital divide; Economic development; Economics; Equality; Freedom of information; Globalization; Information technology; Internet access; Mass media; Occupations; Sex differences; Social change; Social networks; Sociology; System theory; Telecommunication; Women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The thesis is broadly in two sections: a simulation section, which focuses on government stakeholders, and a large-scale data analysis section, which focuses on the public and domestic actor stakeholders. In the simulation section, it demonstrates that the nonproliferation norm is an emergent behavior from political alliance and hostility networks, and that alliances play a role in current day nuclear proliferation. This model is robust and contains second-order effects of extended hostility and alliance relations. In the large-scale data analysis section, the thesis demonstrates the role that context plays in sentiment evaluation and highlights how Twitter collection can provide useful input to policy processes. It first highlights the results of an on-campus study where users demonstrated that context plays a role in sentiment assessment. Then, in an analysis of a Twitter dataset of over 7.5 million messages, it assesses the role of ‘noise’ and biases in online data collection. In a deep dive analyzing the Iranian nuclear agreement, we demonstrate that the middle east is not facing a nuclear arms race, and show that there is a structural hole in online discussion surrounding nuclear proliferation. By combining both approaches, policy analysts have a complete and generalizable set of computational tools to assess and analyze disparate stakeholder roles in nuclear proliferation.",5/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715274.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, the transactive energy market framework has emerged as the key framework for future electricity market design in the electricity grid. However, most of the work done in this area has focused on developing retail level transactive energy markets. There seems to be an underlying assumption that wholesale electricity markets are ready to support any retail market design. In this dissertation, we focus on designing wholesale electricity markets that can better support transactive retail market. On the highest level, this dissertation contributes towards developing tools and models for future electricity market designs. A particular focus is placed on the relationship between wholesale markets and investment planning. Part I of this dissertation uses relatively simple models and case studies to evaluate key impediments to flexible transmission operation. In doing so, we identify several potential areas of concern in wholesale market designs: 1. There is a lack of consideration of demand flexibility both in the long-run and in the short-run 2. There is a disconnect between operational practices and investment planning 3. There is a need to rethink forward markets to better manage resource adequacy under long-term uncertainties 4. There is a need for more robust modeling tools for wholesale market design In Part II and Part III of this dissertation, we make use of mathematical decomposition and agent-based simulations to tackle these concerns. Part II of this dissertation uses Benders Decomposition and Lagrangian Decomposition to spatially and temporally decompose a power system and operation problem with active participation of flexible loads. In doing so, we are able to not only improve the computational efficiency of the problem, but also gain various insights on market structure and pricing. In particular, the decomposition suggests the need for a coordinated investment market and forward energy market to bridge the disconnect between operational practices and investment planning. Part III of this dissertation combines agent-based modeling with state-machine based modeling to test various spot, forward, and investment market designs, including the coordinated investment market and forward energy market proposed in Part II of this dissertation. In addition, we test a forward energy market design where 75% of load is required to be purchased in a 2-year-ahead forward market and various transmission cost recovery strategies. We demonstrate how the different market designs result in different investment decisions, winners, and losers. The market insights lead to further policy recommendations and open questions. Overall, this dissertation takes initial steps towards demonstrating how mathematical decomposition and agent-based simulations can be used as part of a larger market design toolbox to gain insights into different market designs and rules for the future electricity grid. In addition, this dissertation identifies market design ideas for further studies, particularly in the design of forward markets and investment cost recovery mechanisms.",4/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:57,5/20/25 15:22,,,,,,,Market Design for the Future Electricity Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720491.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/5HCJXTUE/Tee - 2017 - Market Design for the Future Electricity Grid Modeling Tools and Investment Case Studies.pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a multitude of different data sources exist, coherent sets of information on used electronics and their movement are lacking because of inherent challenges in obtaining such information. In spite of these challenges, a characterization of the sources, destinations, and quantities of used electronics flows would inform strategic decision-making of numerous stakeholders. A variety of approaches were reviewed for their potential to form a comprehensive quantitative characterization of used electronics generation, collection in the United States and export from the United States. First, the sales obsolescence method was selected to stochastically estimate the generation of used electronics. Collection rates were modeled and applied to the generation results; the collection results serve as upper bounds on export estimates. The export approaches chosen are applicable to all used electronics product types and give insight into the destinations of the exports. Despite concerns about the reliability of export trade data, the trade data approach was selected because of the abundance of available data for recent decades. The Bayesian Truth Serum Survey of Used Electronics Processors approach was selected for its ability to inform quantitative and qualitative characterizations with moderate effort. Comprehensive datasets were not as available for more reliable approaches. The generation and collection approaches were applied to the case of used laptop computers in the United States in 2010. Approximately 22 million laptops were generated and 12 million used laptops were collected. Uncertainty parameters were modeled for each estimate. Additional data sources, such as owner surveys, are necessary to create quality estimates of other types of used electronics since data is less available. The results of the two export approaches diverged. The trade data approach is believed to provide an underestimate, and resulted in a mean estimate of 0.9 million exported used laptops. The results of the survey, combined with collection estimates, resulted in an estimate of 6.0 to 12.0 million exported used laptops.",2012,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,Quantitative characterization of transboundary flows of used electronics,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2012 S.M.,Book Title: Quantitative characterization of transboundary flows of used electronics : a case study of the United States,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As grid operators integrate these fundamentally different devices into the grid, there has been a paradigm shift in how they plan and operate the electrical grid. However, grid operators use traditional methods and generators to work around IBRs, rather than taking advantage of their operating capabilities. This thesis proposes solutions to three of the most pressing issues related to integrating IBRs into the electrical grid: voltage stability, frequency support, and transmission expansion. In Chapter 2, I evaluate whether solar photovoltaic (PV) inverters improve nighttime voltages on the grid and how much that operation costs compared to the traditional solution of installing voltage compensators, such as a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM). I find that nighttime voltages on the grid improve when PV inverters provide voltage support at night, reducing system costs by millions of dollars, or 4- 15 times less costly than installing a STATCOM. In Chapter 3, I examine if IBRs can provide fast frequency response (FFR) to support grid frequency and replace system inertia. I introduce an FFR requirement in a unit commitment and economic dispatch (UCED) model to assess the competitiveness of wind, solar, and battery storage in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) ancillary service market. I find that under low IBR penetration, an FFR requirement increases energy prices by 7%, but that cost goes down to zero under high IBR penetration. In Chapter 4, I investigate whether incorporating long-term load forecast (LTLF) uncertainties can affect the production cost savings differences of transmission expansion projects that accommodate more IBR penetration on the grid, which is a key factor in transmission expansion decision-making. I develop a distribution of LTLF errors for ERCOT’s eight regions that I use in an optimal power flow of a nodal ERCOT model to gauge the effect of LTLF uncertainties on production cost savings of three transmission expansion improvement options. The heterogeneity of the LTLF errors reduces the production cost savings differences between the three options by millions of dollars, making two of the options indistinguishable.",2023,5/20/25 15:35,5/20/25 15:35,5/20/25 15:35,4298768 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 4298768 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Electrical and Electronic Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
B86KCCZD,thesis,2014,"Accuardi, Zachary A. Campbell; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Resource use in the Chinese building sector: foundations for analyzing urban transition,,,,,,"Around the world, people are moving to cities in order to become wealthy, especially in developing countries undergoing socio-economic transition. This will dramatically change the way that society consumes resources, in terms of both materials and energy. We will need to better understand how resource use changes as development happens in order to focus efforts to reduce that resource use. China is undergoing this transition as it enters the global stage, and with global implications for resource use. The building sector in China is especially resource-intensive, fundamentally driven by the country's urbanization, and plays a prominent role in the Chinese economy, making it a good candidate for the study of how systems adopt sustainable practices. I approach this problem in two ways. The first is quantitative, using k-means statistical clustering on longitudinal resource use data from Chinese statistical yearbooks, in order to identify and compare transitions across provinces in China. In comparing the evolution of the building sector across provinces, my analysis suggests that development pathways are more distinct than discrete development stages. I identify two development pathway 'types' in China. The first is an urban path taken by Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin -- the three most heavily urbanized provinces. All other provinces follow a general business-as-usual path, though I also identify sub-pathways to further differentiate between the other 27 provinces. These development typologies are one means of quantitatively operationalizing the abstract notion of transition. Identifying such pathways may highlight opportunities for learning between provinces within the same path, and one could apply similar methods to other scales of analysis (e.g. urban or national). My second approach is qualitative, driven by interviews conducted primarily in Beijing with various stakeholders in the Chinese building sector. In this analysis, I discuss the particularities of the actors and processes involved in Chinese real estate development, identify opportunities for and barriers to reduced life-cycle energy use in buildings, and describe three distinctive and ongoing sustainability experiments with the potential for significant resource use reductions. This research emphasizes the need for integrated approaches to both research and practice in approaching sustainability transitions, and provides a set of complementary frameworks for their analysis.",2014,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Resource use in the Chinese building sector,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Resource use in the Chinese building sector : foundations for analyzing urban transition,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BDUTK3VL,thesis,2014,"Li, Yuanjian Carla; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",Value of more sophistication: capital investment decision-making with competitive dynamics in the mining industry,,,,,,"In many mining markets, one of the central business planning decisions faced by firms is where, when, and by how much to expand their production capacity. Appropriate investment planning methodology is important to both the mining industry and the wider economy. Currently, new mine investment decisions are most often based on the classic project evaluation methodology of discounted cash flow analysis (DCF) applied to the individual potential projects, which is flawed in its inadequate consideration of risk and flexibility, of impact on the profit of the firm, and of competitive dynamics in oligopoly markets. More sophisticated methods that account for these complexities have been proposed in academic literature; however, their value in realistic market settings has been little demonstrated in past literature and they are rarely adopted in practice. This thesis compares four investment decision paradigms of increasing scope and complexity in a three-firm mineral commodity market, based primarily on the firm-level cash flow NPV outcome in Monte Carlo simulations of the market. The analysis is conducted for various market scenarios of different demand growth patterns, volatility, demand elasticity, and supply structure. Simulation results show that in almost all scenarios, the game theoretic and option-based best-firm-NPV policies outperform the positive-mine-NPV policy substantially for all firms, regardless their market and cost position. However, the difference between the best-firm-NPV policy and the positive-firm-NPV policy is often small, depending on the scenario. Overall, the evaluation conducted in this thesis contributes to our understanding of how useful having more sophisticated investment decision methods might be to the firms and under what market conditions.",2014,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Value of more sophistication,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Value of more sophistication : capital investment decision-making with competitive dynamics in the mining industry,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BDV3KHID,thesis,2014,"Jenkins, Jesse D.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program","Economic regulation of electricity distribution utilities under high penetration of distributed energy resources: applying an incentive compatible menu of contracts, reference network model and uncertainty mechanisms",,,,,,"Ongoing changes in the use and management of electricity distribution systems - including the proliferation of distributed energy resources, smart grid technologies (i.e., advanced power electronics and information and communication technologies) and active system management techniques - present new challenges for the economic regulation of electricity distribution utilities. In particular, regulators are likely to face increased uncertainty regarding the evolution of network uses and the efficient cost of network investments and maintenance, as well as an increased informational disadvantage vis-a-vis the regulated utility. These challenges are especially important for regulatory approaches that establish some share of the utility's allowed revenues ex ante (e.g., incentive regulation, also known as revenue or price cap regulation, RPI-X, performance-based regulation, or output-based regulation). This thesis proposes a novel process for establishing the allowed revenues of an electricity distribution utility and demonstrates its application as a practical solution to the imminent regulatory challenges discussed above. The proposed method is a new combination of three established regulatory tools: an engineering-based reference network model (RNM) for forward-looking benchmarking of efficient network expenditures; an incentive compatible menu of contracts to elicit accurate forecasts from the utility and create incentives for cost saving efficiency efforts; and ex post automatic adjustment mechanisms, or ""delta factors,"" to accommodate uncertainty in the evolution of network use and minimize forecast error. Chapter 1 reviews the theoretical economic foundations of the regulation of network monopolies, identifies emerging challenges in the regulation of electricity distribution companies, and introduces the proposed regulatory method. Chapter 2 describes the simulation of a realistic, large-scale urban distribution network used to demonstrate the novel regulatory process proposed in this thesis. Chapter 3 uses the simulated distribution network to demonstrate, step-by-step, the practical implementation of the novel regulatory process, evaluates its performance, and summarizes the advantages for the economic regulation of electricity distribution utilities under increasing penetration of distributed energy resources.",2014,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,Economic regulation of electricity distribution utilities under high penetration of distributed energy resources,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,"Book Title: Economic regulation of electricity distribution utilities under high penetration of distributed energy resources : applying an incentive compatible menu of contracts, reference network model and uncertainty mechanisms",,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using forecasts for decision-making is complicated by their inherent uncertainty. An interview-based study qualitatively and a survey empirically investigate forecast use in emergency management. Emergency managers perceive uncertainty as a given rather than as a problem. To cope with the uncertainty, decision-makers gather as much information as possible; forecasts are only one piece of information among many. For decision-making, emergency managers say that they rely more on radar than on river forecasting. However, forecasts play an important role in communication with the public, because they are the official interpretation of the situation. Emergency managers can add a lot of value to those forecasts by combining them with local knowledge, but might not do so because of accountability concerns. Forecasts must have value to emergency managers, because those with more work experience rely more on them than those without. Another study further develops the application of quantile regression to generate probabilistic river forecasts. Compared to existing research, this study includes a larger number of river gages; includes more independent variables; and studies longer lead times. Additionally, it is the first to apply this method to the U.S. American context. It was found that the model has to be customized for each river gage for extremely high event thresholds. For other thresholds and across lead times, a one-size-fits-all model suffices. The model performance is robust to the size of the training dataset, but depends on the year, the river gage, lead time and event threshold that are being forecast. An additional study considers the robustness of stormwater management to the amount of runoff. Impervious surfaces, such as roads and parking lots, can increase the amount of runoff and lead to more pollution reaching streams, rivers, and lakes. Best Management Practices (BMPs) reduce the peak discharge into the storm sewer system and remove pollutants such as sediments, phosphorus and nitrogen from the stormwater runoff. Empirically, it is found that BMP effectiveness decreases sooner, steeper and deeper with increasing sizes of storm events than assumed in current computer models.",12/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Uncertainty in River Forecasts,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6724103.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed supply chain risks, production capacity, and recycling in use-case scenarios that varied battery chemistry and demand. We first analyzed tradeoffs between battery mineral supply chain risks and battery performance characteristics for global stationary storage. We compared electrochemical batteries, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), and found that lithium iron phosphate (LFP) generally has the fewest supply risks despite high material needs and low specific energy. LFP may be the most appealing choice for stationary storage installations where energy and power density are not essential. Our results indicate that supply chain risks for lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) 811 are similar to NMC 111. However, surprisingly, in our framework, the nickel in NMC 811 has more environmental impacts than the cobalt in NMC 111. Our research on global material production capacity for scenarios of LIB chemistry mixes and electric vehicle (EV) car deployments suggests that meeting global demand for refined cobalt may be challenging in 1 to 15 years, even under high production capacity levels. Class 1 nickel demand in EV cars may surpass production capacity in 15 to 20 years under average and high production levels. Our findings indicate that nickel composition in spent end-of-life (EOL) EV batteries in the U.S. will remain high relative to cobalt or lithium in the next 30 years, regardless of which battery chemistry becomes dominant in the market. High nickel content may alleviate recyclers' concerns about recent developments to swap out nickel- and cobaltconcentrated chemistries for LFPs. The mass of U.S. EOL battery materials in all scenarios surpasses our slow, medium, and fast growth cases for U.S. recycling capacity. The findings of this thesis are relevant to policies that aim to reduce long-term risks to battery materials.",10/31/22,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/21433038.v1,,"/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/2D8U63XU/Khan - 2022 - Analyzing Production, Recycling, and Supply Chain Risks for Battery Minerals in Electric Vehicles an.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this dissertation, I provide three examples that illustrate how uncertainty is often not adequately characterized, how missing data can pose a barrier to climate-relevant policy making, and how big data and machine learning could be used to obtain important information. I conclude with a survey and a discussion of how artificial intelligence can be applied to climate change mitigation. In the first chapter, I show how to construct an empirical estimate of the uncertainty of long-termenergy forecasts based on past forecast errors, using projections made by the U.S. Energy InformationAgency (EIA). This method gives analysts and decision-makers a means to estimate the uncertaintyof those forecasts quantitatively. Energy forecasts provide the basis for financial evaluation of energyinvestments as well as for energy system models. I lay the groundwork for evaluating the performance of these methods in the data-scarce setting of long-term forecasts. The EIA has used my results in their most recent retrospective review. The second chapter is based on a topical review of policies to decarbonize heavy freight transportationby shifting freight from road to rail and water. I find that while the freight sector is responsible for a large share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a systematic analysis of the potential to decarbonize with modal shift is still missing from the literature. This is partly due to a lack ofpublicly available, standardized, and updated data. For a global comparison of modal split and trends, I expanded existing databases with national freight activity from 2000-2017. I find that only less than half of the countries in the world provide such information on road freight activity. The third chapter provides an example of how big data and machine learning (ML) could be used to fill in information gaps that inhibit climate policy analysis. I use satellite imagery for truck traffic monitoring in areas where this information is otherwise difficult to obtain. I count the number of freight vehicles visible in the images with deep convolutional neural networks, and estimate theaverage annual truck traffic on roads from those counts by modeling traffic variation patterns. In a final chapter, I discuss how methods from artificial intelligence can be used to improve socioeconomic, policy, and engineering research for climate change mitigation. I provide a survey ofthe literature and identify the main barriers and challenges that arise at the intersection of those disciplines. Research in this area demands both careful design of ML algorithms and consideration of domain knowledge.

In the first study we focus on the deployment of green field next generationaccess network infrastructures when the national regulatory authority has thepower to define geographical markets at sub-national level for which it can applydifferentiated regulatory remedies - Geographically Segmented Regulation(GSR). Using a game theory model that we developed, we confirm the asymmetricbusiness case for the geographic development of these new infrastructures:highly populated areas are likely to develop into competitive telecommunicationmarkets while regions with low household density will only see limited investmentand little or no competition. We show that supply side interdependenciesamong markets make the implementation of GSR non-trivial, namely, we showthat changes in the wholesale access price in one market can have undesirableconsequences in the competitive conditions of interrelated regions wherewholesale prices are unchanged. In the second study we focus on how individual purchase decisions are influenced by the behavior of others in their social circle. We study the case ofthe diffusion of the iPhone 3G across a number of communities sampled froma dataset provided by a major mobile carrier in one country. We find thatthe propensity of adoption increases with the proportion of each indivudal'sadopter friends. We estimate that 14% of iPhone 3G adoptions in this carrierwere due to peer influence. We provide results from several policy experimentsthat show that with this level of effect from peer influence the carrier wouldhardly be able to significantly increase sales by selectively targeting consumersto benefit from viral marketing.

We use the VoD system of a large telecommunications provider duringhalf a year in 2012. The system suggests movies to consumers ordered by thenumber of consumer likes they obtained in previous weeks. We manipulatedsuch natural order by randomly swapping likes across movies. We found thatmovies promoted (demoted) increased (decreased) sales, but the amount of informationpublicly available about movies affected the result. Better knownmovies were less sensitive to manipulations. Finally a movie promoted (demoted)to a fake slot sold 15.9% less (27.7% more) than a true movie placed atthat slot, on average across all manipulations. A movie promoted (demoted)to a fake slot received 33.1% fewer (30.1% more) likes than a true movie atthat slot. Hence manipulated movies tended to move back to their true slotsover time. This means that self-fulfilling prophecies widely discussed in theliterature on the effect of ratings on sales are hard to sustain in markets withcostly goods that are sufficiently well-known.",8/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:26,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716372.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BKWKVB2P,thesis,2014,"Liu, Tingyu; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Multi-stakeholder collaborations & biomarker development and implementation,,,,,,"The rise of genomic technologies and increasing interest in personalized medicine have triggered a renewed focus on the role of biomarkers in drug development and clinical care. While many stakeholders, including industry, regulatory agencies, patients, academia, and payers, are involved in biomarker development and use, these stakeholders reside in functional siloes that lead to fragmented outputs and efforts. Thus, although biomarker discovery is extensive, biomarker adoption in the R&D process and clinical care is slow, complex, and opaque. The gap between discovery and practice needs to be bridged by clear and consistent evidentiary standards, regulations and policies. Biomarker adoption requires a systems effort that includes active dialogue and understanding among all stakeholders. The level of discussions and resources (data, samples, expertise, financial, etc.) needed also makes this field particularly fertile for collaboration. This thesis suggests that multi-stakeholder collaborations (MSCs) can address the challenges of biomarker adoption. It describes what has been achieved in existing prominent MSCs, extracts general lessons on their contributions, and provides recommendations on the use of MSCs in drug development. Specifically, MSCs have demonstrated impact across 4 key areas: 1) data generation and establishment of standards; 2) development of scientific processes for biomarker evaluation and use; 3) the structuring of innovative operational and organizational scaffolds for collaboration; and 4) delivery of vetted regulatory recommendations and robust biomarkers for use by drug developers and clinicians. Understanding the roles, evolution, and challenges of MSCs will be important in enhancing the capacity to collaborate to address the complex challenges for biomedical innovation and healthcare outcomes.",2014,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Multi-stakeholder collaborations & biomarker development and implementation,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disability affects everyone in society, however, the most affected are individuals with disabilities who live in a society with various systems that must interact with one another to ensure that a person with a disability is included. This explorative study was conducted at the University of Johannesburg with students with disabilities (SwDs), and the purpose of this study was to gain a detailed insight into the experiences of students with disabilities on the support structures at the University of Johannesburg. To meet the overall purpose of this study, the following objectives were set:1. To explore the views and experiences of students with disabilities on the support structures at the University of Johannesburg.2. To describe the strengths and weaknesses of the available support program me s to address the challenges experienced by students with disabilities at the University of Johannesburg.3. To formulate recommendations that will improve support structures at the University for students with disabilities.Literature from various libraries and websites was gathered and consulted. The literature highlighted that there is an increase in SwDs entering higher education. The student adopted an ecological perspective which was useful in providing an understanding of how SwDs relate to their environment and investigated factors that inhibit or contribute to the progress of SwDs from the University of Johannesburg.Permission to collect data was obtained from the participants and clearance was sought and provided by UJ’s ethical committee prior to the data collection (see attached addendum). Ten participants were interviewed using semi-structured and focus groups as methods of data collection.Through this study, five themes were identified and broken into smaller categories. The themes identified are: (a) SwDs’ perception of support structures at UJ; (b ) access to support services; (c ) resilience of SwDs; (d ) barriers to seeking support and (e) strategies to reduce disability discrimination or enhance SwDs' inclusion at the University of Johannesburg. Various issues emerged from this study; the most critical was that SwDs had both negative and positive experiences of the support systems at UJ. Some students experienced discrimination from the support structures and this impacted on their future access to certain services whilst other students displayed resilience and coping mechanisms for challenges that they experienced within the UJ environment. The final chapter provided recommendations that emanated from the study which included sensitisation of all staff at UJ ; particularly administrators since they are the first point of contact for students. Another recommendation was a communication platform where SwDs can also express their experiences for better inclusion at the Institute.",2016,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: The Experiences of Students with Disabilities on Support Structures at the University of Johannesburg ISBN: 9798708770707,,,,,Cerebral palsy; Culture; Disability studies; Educational psychology; Educational sociology; Equality before the law; Human rights; Inclusive education; Management information systems; Occupations; People with disabilities; Students with disabilities; System theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Commonwealth's academic and industrial institutions produce a consistent stream of cutting-edge scientific research and the region has a well-developed professional and financial infrastructure to support the translation of these ideas into useful products. Venture capital (VC) plays a particularly important role in this ecosystem. VC funding is essential to most life sciences companies due to their high research and development costs and long time to market. The economic downturn of 2008 led to a rapid and significant contraction in the ability of venture capital firms to raise the funding that supports their work. We use this setting to test the impact of a funding shock on life sciences focused venture capital resource allocation. Specifically we looked at the rate and direction of funding choices made by venture capitalists before and after the downturn. We analyzed data on yearly venture capital fundraising and 22,345 observations of investment dyads between venture capital firms and the portfolio companies which they invested in from the ten year period beginning in the year 2000. Additionally, seventy-six interviews with stakeholders in the Massachusetts life sciences community were conducted to help us understand the actual impact of data trends. This resulted in four major findings: (1) Although all venture capital fundraising was hindered in 2008 and 2009, life sciences focused venture funds were impacted disproportionately lightly in 2008 and disproportionately severely in 2009. (2) There has been a decline in the mean level of venture capital funding that companies are receiving. (3) The rate of new company formation is slowing as the rate of reinvestment in existing companies increases. (4) Innovation is being negatively impacted as fewer new companies translate technology into useful products and existing companies scale back their research and development pipelines.",2010,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,"Technological innovation, venture formation and resource allocation",,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,"Book Title: Technological innovation, venture formation and resource allocation : the impact of economic downturn on life sciences venture capital and start-ups",,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through large-scale measurements, we empirically describe some salient elements of the online criminal infrastructures, and we derive economic models characterizing the associated monetization paths enabling criminal profitability. This analysis reveals the existence of structural choke points: components of online criminal operations being limited in number, and critical for the operations’ profitability. Consequently, interventions targeting such components can reduce the opportunities and incentives to engage in online crime through an increase in criminal operational costs, and in the risk of apprehension. We define a methodology describing the process of distilling the knowledge gained from the empirical measurements on the criminal infrastructures towards identifying and evaluating appropriate countermeasures. We argue that countermeasures, as defined in the context of situational crime prevention, can be effective for a long-term reduction in the occurrence of online crime.",8/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723266.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BT9W5QZK,thesis,2013,"Cross-Call, Daniel Frederick; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Matching energy storage to small island electricity systems: a case study of the Azores,,,,,,"Island economies rely almost entirely on imported diesel and fuel oil to supply their energy needs, resulting in significant economic and environmental costs. In recognition of the benefits of clean energy development, many islands are pursuing ambitious goals for renewable energy. For example, the Azores Islands of Portugal have set a goal to achieve 75% renewable energy by 2018. Despite significant environmental and economic benefits, however, the introduction of renewable energy sources introduces new operating challenges to island power systems, including intermittent and uncertain generation patterns. This research investigates energy storage on small island power systems under scenarios of increasing penetrations of variable-output wind. The analysis applies a least-cost unit commitment model to three Azores island networks (Sdo Miguel, Faial and Flores), in order to determine expected cost savings from introducing energy storage onto those systems. Modeling results indicate that renewable energy coupled with energy storage can produce significant savings in operating costs on island electricity systems- above those levels achieved from renewable generation alone. Furthermore, the research suggests that storage power (in terms of available megawatts for discharging energy) is more critical than storage capacity (megawatt-hours of available storage) for achieving costs savings and clean energy goals. The largest impacts from storage will come from relatively small-sized storage installations, above which there is a diminishing return from storage.",2013,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Matching energy storage to small island electricity systems,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2013 S.M.,Book Title: Matching energy storage to small island electricity systems : a case study of the Azores,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It answers the question: Can corporations tie corporate social responsibility to the profit-making mission, and, if so, how? We define CSR as the actions that exceed the expectations placed upon the corporation. We demonstrate that the level of expectations, separating social irresponsibility from responsibility, is dynamic-changing over time and by region. This level is influenced by the maximum of three forces: social norms, market forces, regulatory standards. Actions that exceed expectations, what we consider CSR, are then categorized here in three broad groups: 1) Philanthropic: projects dealing with social good that have little or no relation to the corporate mission. 2) Strategic: initiatives that align and advance social and business goals simultaneously. 3) Social: actions typically addressed by social entrepreneurship designed and executed predominantly to target a social need. Finally, we validate the CSR framework and introduce areas of value-creation to be considered by corporations when making the decision to perform CSR.

BVGL7TGV,thesis,2021,"Yuan, Yuan; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Understanding and reshaping social networks with advanced computational techniques,,,,,,"Social networks are powerful in modeling interdependence among individuals. Recently, the availability of large-scale social network data and advances in computational tools have facilitated the rapid development in social network research. However, a few important aspects of social networks have been understudied, and advanced computational tools may not directly help social scientists draw scientific knowledge. My thesis thus aims to move towards applying and developing computational tools that help investigate important questions on social networks. The first component of my thesis focuses on understanding social interactions and networks, which offers implications for reshaping social networks to improve social cohesion. Specifically, I examine the formation and dynamics of social networks, with a focus on social exchange and ""long ties."" Utilizing large-scale social network data and computational tools, I first discuss benefits of the social exchange with dissimilar people in social networks; and then I proceed to study dynamic social networks and focus on long ties, or the social ties that bridge different communities in dynamic networks. Methodologically, I develop a novel interdisciplinary approach that combines game theory and machine learning techniques Second, I study what features on online platforms may improve social interactions and reshape social networks. To do so, I utilize large-scale data of online social media and provide two examples in the field. The first example is the identification of social contagion of online gift giving. This study examines how receiving a gift would promote the person to pay forward the gift, and also discusses how this social contagion can promote social interactions and tight social bonds. The other example is to examine how the designs of peer effects and prosociality on online social platforms encourage users' offline fitness behavior. Methodologically, both studies involve advanced causal inference and machine learning techniques to test the main hypotheses. Moreover, I develop computational tools that analyze social network data. In the final component of my thesis, I introduce an algorithm for controlled experiments in social networks. This algorithm detects heterogeneous spillover effects -- how the treatment assignments received by one's network neighbors affect a person's behavior -- in the data of networked experiments. This interdisciplinary algorithm combines approaches in causal inference, machine learning, and network science.",2021,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Understanding and reshaping social networks with advanced computational techniques,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The roots of this problem lie in systemic racism and segregated schools. The overwhelming majority of economically disadvantaged African American high school students at segregated schools receive substandard mathematics education. One part of this study consists of analysis of Chicago Public Schools (CPS) data, showing vast inequities in the education delivered to the 72% of African American CPS students who attend segregated schools. Data from interviews of 24 freshmen in low-level algebra classes at one such CPS school support the major part of this study. The interviewees answer questions about their experiences as mathematics students and as African Americans. Results of this study found students to be teacher dependent, to approach math lessons as unconnected to previous knowledge, and to take a narrow view towards the value of mathematics. Students had not encountered autonomous learning in mathematics, learned to approach difficult problems with confidence and perseverance nor experienced the joy of solving a challenging problem. While students are aware of racism's existence, they are unclear about how it affects them directly. Students do not recognize that the segregated schools and neighborhoods of their lives are a result of racism. They accept their substandard education as normal and are uncritical of their schools. Students repeat anti-Black stereotypes about fellow students in relation to violence, interest in education, and self-responsibility. Mathematics educators need to be aware of the social context of math education. Segregated, economically disadvantaged African American students are likely to have learned teacher-dependence and narrow approaches to mathematics. It is therefore crucial that teachers develop lessons and practices aimed at moving students in the opposite direction, to become independent conceptual thinkers. This is no simple task, particularly for students who have developed these practices over many years of school. Researchers can prioritize the development of autonomy-building, conceptually based lessons and practices and school systems can support teachers' collaborative efforts in this regard.

BVUENRT2,thesis,2010,"Tagert, Adam C.",Cybersecurity Challenges in Developing Nations,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Cybersecurity_Challenges_in_Developing_Nations/6715520/1,"This thesis examines the guidance that is being given to developing nations that are rapidly deploying information and communication technologies. It studied the African countries of Rwanda and Tunisia to draw lessons of the situation and potential methods of improving the situation. The thesis found that developing nations are often recommended to implement a conglomeration of existing rules and regulations found in other countries especially in European countries and in the United States. Developing countries are also recommended to create national CERTs, organizations of cybersecurity experts to coordinate a nation to respond to cyber incidents. The proposed rules and regulations are largely irrelevant for developing nations and the proposed missions of a CERT do not match the needs of those countries. In promoting better guidance, the thesis identifies and discusses several challenges. It finds policy makers in developing nations are aware of the cyber threat, and that the cyber threat is different and often smaller in less ICT developed nations even if they are using similar equipment and software. To help craft better recommendations, the thesis identifies the benefits of ICT especially in agriculture, education and government. These benefits are analyzed to determine whether they would be protected by current guidance and the analysis determines that protecting ICT use in government should be the priority. In crafting future guidance the challenges are that nations have differences in ICT architecture and ICT use, and developing nations have fewer resources but also they have different resources to use. Another such difference is the common lack of a private cybersecurity sector and different expectations of government. This thesis concludes with discussing unexpected results. The first is Rwandan policy makers desire good enough security and have a higher risk tolerance concerning cyber threats than is found in more developed nations. In addition, open source software can be a potential way to reduce the cost of cyberspace defense and this thesis makes an initial investigation. The lesson of the thesis is that cybersecurity strategy is not a one size fits all and so it must be customized for each country.",12/1/10,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715520.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BWBHX6VM,thesis,2012,"Kishimoto, Paul Natsuo; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program","Passenger transport in China under climate constraints: general equilibrium analysis, uncertainty, and policy",,,,,,"Vehicle sales and road travel volume in China have grown rapidly in recent years, and with them energy demand, greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution. Aviation and rail travel have also grown, while ceding a large share to private vehicles. What path will household transport demand in China take in the future? How might it interact with policies which limit greenhouse gases, and what are the implications for energy use, the environment and the economy? To contribute policy insights and a foundation for future study in this area, I undertake a new calibration of the Chinese household transport sector in the MIT Emissions Prediction & Policy Analysis (EPPA) computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, implementing income elasticities of demand for vehicle travel and vehicle stock growth based on historical data. To bracket uncertainty in the literature, I impose three scenarios of future growth in demand for purchased (air, rail and marine) and vehicle modes. These are explored under a no-policy baseline, a climate-stabilization policy, and with a policy that extends the emissions-intensity goal of China's Twelfth Five-Year Plan-both policies are modelled as caps creating prices on carbon. Examining the results, I find that trends in growth are only modesty affected by policy continuing present energy-intensity goals, with small decreases in travel activity and energy intensity of vehicles combining for a reduction in refined oil use; such a policy has modest cost and affects household transport less than other sectors. In contrast, my results show that a stringent emissions cap has large impacts on vehicle efficiency, limits vehicle ownership and general travel activity levels. Compared to the no-policy baseline, a smaller vehicle fleet (250 million total, or 200 per 1000 capita). Sixteen percent of the fleet is new energy vehicles (plug-in hybrid-electrics), while total refined oil use increases by 2050 to nearly three times its 2010 level. However, these effects come with a reduction in total primary energy as the policy is introduced, and large costs economy-wide. Chinese national and municipal policies include objectives of promoting vehicle ownership and mobility on the one hand, and of reducing dependence on carbon-intensive refined oil on the other. My findings illustrate that these goals are at odds, and offer inputs to policy design related to vehicle sales, public transit, congestion, pollution and energy security.",2012,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,Passenger transport in China under climate constraints,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2012 S.M.,"Book Title: Passenger transport in China under climate constraints : general equilibrium analysis, uncertainty, and policy",,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A data-driven multi-zonal thermal response model is formulated and fit to EnergyPlus simulation data from a Department of Energy Small Office Reference Commercial Building for the months of June, July and August. When validated and tested against EnergyPlus simulation data, the thermal response model performs well. The thermal response model is then used in a co-optimization of energy and ancillary provision for a small office building with a variable air volume system from [9] using summer wholesale electricity and ancillary services prices from ISO-NE. Under six different price cases, the individual small office building provides maximum hourly regulation and spinning reserve capacities of 3.2 and 4.4 kW respectively and daily total regulation and spinning reserve capacities of 51 and 46 kW respectively. When scaled up over similar building stock in New England, small office buildings can provide up to 9.5% of ISO-NE's daily regulation requirement and 8% of the daily spinning reserves requirement. From an economic perspective, a small office building's potential summer ancillary services' revenues are not sufficient to drive investment in installation of a building automation system, variable air volume system and associated metering. However, buildings may invest in the necessary equipment for energy cost reductions and to participate in other demand response programs.

By using the case of a leading wireless network service provider in Ecuador, the document explores changes in the supply chain structure resulting from the evolution of its relationship with a supply chain solutions company, Brightstar. This evolution is represented by three different cell phone supply chains. The supply chains provide examples of responses to the supply chain challenges. The performances of the supply chains are compared based on the notion of responsiveness. To this end, system dynamics is used as a tool to analyze the different systems and the dynamics in action.

The current accuracy of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) technique is below centimetre level and this allows very accurate determination of velocity field parameters. This study focused on utilizing GNSS to determine the intercontinental plate velocity field for Africa in support of the African Geodetic Reference Frame (AFREF). Data spanning 12.4 years were processed in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2008) using GAMIT/GLOBK 10.4 (developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Primarily, processing of data focused on International GNSS Service (IGS) stations with a few non-IGS stations (which are of geodetic quality) included, such as Hamburg (HAMB) and Matjiesfontein (MATJ). The same data set was analysed using the Combination and Analyses of Terrestrial Reference Frame (CATREF) software developed at Institut National de l’Information Géographique et Forestière (IGN). Validation of the results was achieved through comparison of the velocity solution from this study with a solution obtained from a core of IGS GNSS stations processed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). No significant differences were evident between the GAMIT/GLOBK 10.4, CATREF and JPL solutions. The results from the Matjiesfontein station indicated that the proposed Matjiesfontein Observatory site shows no significant vertical or horizontal local motion; this information is valuable in that there is no obvious local site instability. The velocity field as derived by GNSS displays no unexpected deviations and supports current understanding of the motion of the Nubian, Somalian and Arabian plates. Furthermore, the comparison of the velocity vectors derived from the IGS station HRAO, Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) MOBLAS-6 station and 26 m Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) telescope, which are collocated at the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO) indicated good agreement and both techniques exhibit no significant vertical motion. This study also contributed to the first computation of the AFREF solution. It is envisaged that as more stations are added to the sparsely distributed current network, more accurate results and better tectonic models can be derived. The availability of station velocities will facilitate adjustments within the AFREF.",2013,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Determination of geodetic velocity field parameters for the African tectonic plate using the technique of Global Navigation Satellite Systems ISBN: 9781321956054,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it would be technically possible to make changesthat could sustain many critical electricity-dependent services during widespread and longlastingoutages by implementing smart grid technologies, distributed generation resources, andother technologies, these technologies would require incremental investments where the benefitsare uncertain and difficult to quantify in many cases.For many years, distribution utilities in United States have conducted studies of the value thatcustomers place on reliable electric services. However, these studies and associated literaturesuffer from several shortcomings: they have not devoted much effort to help respondents fullyunderstand and consider the various implications of hypothetical outages that respondents maynot have experienced nor previously considered; they have done little to minimize cognitivebiases; they have focused almost exclusively on brief outages that last only up to a few hours;and, they have only considered the difference between full backup service and no service. Hence,their results are not adequate to assess how much individuals or society might, or should, bewilling to avoid longer outages or provide full or limited backup service in the event of largeoutages of long duration.To address these issues, we have developed and demonstrated a set of improved methods thathelp residential customers think systematically about the value they attach to reliable electricservice and have used the elicited informed judgments to illustrate how the results could be usedfor local or regional-decision-making.After introducing the issues in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 summarizes a new elicitation framework thathas been designed to help residential electricity customers think carefully about the value they attach to reliable electric service. The survey framework was applied to a convenience sample ofresidents in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania to assess their willingness-to-pay to receive backupservices during a hypothetical 24-hour outage on a hot summer day. The face-to-face interviewresults suggest that there exists a considerable amount of consumer surplus associated withproviding partial electric backup service (i.e., the respondents’ willingness-to-pay per kWh issignificantly higher for their first bit of electricity than the value of the last amount consumed).Further, the assessed value of sustaining demands the respondents assessed to be high prioritysignificantly increased as they receive additional information and better understood the outagescenario and its consequences.In Chapter 3, we estimated the cost to implement to implement the capability to provide limitedemergency backup power service using isolated distribution feeders, evenly distributed theincremental investment costs across to all residential customers across outages, compared therequired service payment with the measured willingness-to-pay distribution, and exploredwhether and when such investments can be justified. We first conducted a series of order ofmagnitude calculations and found that providing the low-amperage backup service can be morecost-effective than buying a small portable generator and storing diesel or gasoline for refuelingeven if a 24-long outage occurs once every 20 years, and the backup service appears to be morecost-effective if a region is expected to suffer more frequent and longer outages. In addition tothe assessments using private willingness-to-pay, the chapter also considers two methods thatmight be used to recover system upgrade costs without raising a serious equity issue norimposing an excessive burden to either residential customers or the region.In order to explore respondents’ willingness-to-pay under a variety of scenarios for differentgeographical regions more efficiently, the face-to-face survey framework has been modified for online use. Chapter 4 first describes the details of the generalizable web-based survey frameworkthat a researcher or decision-maker can use to design ones’ own outage scenarios. It alsoaddresses several factors that are assumed to influence estimates from stated preference valuationstudies. The framework was then used to elicit the economic and social preferences for reliableelectric backup services during hypothetical 10-day widespread outages from a sample ofresidents of the Northeastern United States. We first demonstrated the importance of helpingrespondents fully consider the various aspects of the consequences of the hypothetical outagesand better articulate their values, and then used the elicited preferences to explore whether andhow much some of the factors that are known to affect respondents’ risk perceptions influencetheir willingness-to-pay values for reliable electric services during the hypothetical outages. Thechapter concludes with a discussion of why exploring preferences for reliable electric servicesunder a variety of scenarios and constructing customer damage functions for electricitycustomers are important, and what we see as future behavioral research needs.Finally, in Chapter 5, we discussed how the elicited preferences can be used to make moreinformed and collective societal decisions. Benefit-cost analysis and other forms of analysis havebeen widely used in policy analysis and government decision-making. However, onlyuncertainties about costs and physical states of the world are considered, neglecting uncertaintyabout the level of benefits that come from the value the public places on policy outcomes. In thischapter, we proposed such an approach that incorporates uncertainties in individual preferences.Using the public valuations of implementing smart grid technologies to mitigate impacts oflarge-regional outages, we showed uncertainty in individual preferences, when aggregated toform societal preference intervals, can substantially change the decision society would make.",9/6/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7207202.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCIs, positioned at the forefront of technological innovation, hold the potential to revolutionize lives on a scale unprecedented by current technologies. We begin with defining BCIs and assessing their current developmental status, emphasizing those forms most likely to soon enter the market and spotlighting key developers in this field. Chapter 2 navigates the intricate regulatory landscape governed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We analyze FDAs regulatory documents, distilling the most pertinent ones for BCI regulation. Special attention is given to the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) and Pre-Market Approval (PMA) processes, vital for assuring the safety and efficacy of implanted BCIs. The heart of this study addresses the shortcomings in the FDA's standardized benefit risk communication methods. We advocate for the adaptation of the Benefit-Risk Framework (BRF), traditionally employed in drug and biologic assessments, to the medical device domain. This proposed application aims to refine communication among developers, regulators, and end-users, ensuring comprehensive understanding of BCIs benefits and risks. We introduce a hypothetical BCI device, reflective of those in current clinical trials, to craft a BRF through an expert elicitation process. This BRF seamlessly integrates medical insights with user-centric considerations, offering a holistic view of the hypothetical device's impact. Employing a decision science approach, particularly informed choice theories, we analyze user responses to various summaries of the BCI and its BRF. Using order-constrained methods, we examine specific hypotheses. Our findings indicate that while the BRF bolsters knowledge of and positivity toward the BCI, the decision to adopt depends more on personal feelings than information depth or amount of knowledge about it. We conclude by highlighting the scientific contributions and policy implications of our study. This research emphasizes the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach in BCI development, bridging the gap between technical innovation and user-centric understanding.",1/19/24,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,A Benefit-Risk Framework for Brain Computer Interfaces,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/24990672.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these countries, India is one of the largest portals and destination grounds for the trafficking and sexual enslavement of women and children. This phenomenological study of sex trafficking survivors in Kolkata, India, sought to gain an in-depth understanding of seven women's lived experiences before and during trafficking, as well as postrescue. The study provides a thorough evaluation of the circumstances and conditions that led to the trafficking of these women, their perceptions of themselves and life for the duration of their trafficking experiences, and their impressions of themselves, their treatment, and their futures, postrescue. The study involved seven women, between the ages of 16 and 22, who had been rescued from sex trafficking and involved in the participating nonprofit's rehabilitation program, for at least six months. For the sake of safety, this researcher worked with the facility to screen participants to ensure that each girl fulfilled these study parameters prior to their taking part in interviews. The study consisted of one phenomenologically based interview covering three distinct phases of their life experiences: pretrafficking, during enslavement, and postrescue. To facilitate the exploration of survivors' unique trafficking experiences, the interviews were semistructured and open-ended. Once data was collected, it was reviewed, collapsed into meaning units, and translated into psychologically relevant terminology. During the final phase of data analysis, identified meaning units were integrated, categorized, and summarized. The relevance of these meaning units as potentially informs the more comprehensive understanding and treatment of sex trafficking survivors will be considered and discussed. Limitations of my research include the current prevalence of literature addressing the lived experiences and psychological treatment of sex trafficking survivors in India, my limited capacity to communicate in North Indian dialects, and my status as a woman from another culture with a higher social and caste status than the women who participated in my study. I believe that my study will prove beneficial to better understanding the relationship between the lived experiences of sex trafficking survivors and their psychological treatment postrescue. Even though there was some resistance to me owing to my disparate cultural background and socioeconomic status, it is my belief that even the tension deriving from this resistance will prove helpful in informing aspects of these women's fear and resistance towards society and culture at large, as they begin their journeys towards healing, repatriation, and reintegration into their local communities.",2013,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,Speaking self out of darkness,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Speaking self out of darkness: The lived experience of sex trafficking survivors in Kolkata, India ISBN: 9781303884535 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 8 Volume: 75",,,,,Child abuse; Children; Clinical psychology; Females; India; Kidnapping; Slavery; Social psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
C787WS6Z,thesis,2015,"Ramey, Nadia",The Impact of Health Information Technology on Inpatient Medical Errors in US Hospitals,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1787183265?pq-origsite=primo,"Background In today’s complex and high risk healthcare environment the race to implement health information technology (health IT) in the care delivery system is becoming more prevalent in United States hospitals but the science to support its safe and effective use is contradictory at best. Since the 1999 Institute of Medicine Report, To Err is Human, Building a Safer Health System; there has been an increasingly intensive focus on the prevention of medical errors and the improvement of hospital safety and quality. In more recent years information technology has been identified as having the potential to reduce and prevent a wide range of issues, including medical errors, thus increasing patient safety, improving the quality of care, and reducing costs. Many hospitals and provides have integrated health IT into the patient care process, usually in the form of decision support systems, electronic health records, provider order entry systems, and the like. However, not all providers, clinicians, and researchers are in agreement on the impact these computerized systems have on safety, quality, and patient outcomes. With contradicting results in the literature and gaps in the evidence of the safe and effective use of health IT there is much to be learned in this area. This research project aims to quantify the impact of health IT on hospitals in the United States by investigating inpatient medical claims data, specifically medical errors and mortality rates and how they are impacted by health IT implementation data. The stage of health IT implementation from year to year will be evaluated for its impact on the number of medical errors and mortality rates. Methods To address the study objectives data from two datasets, the HIMSS Analytics datasets, provided by the Healthcare Information Management and Systems Society (HIMSS) and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample (NIS) datasets provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), were aggregated to form the analysis dataset. To accurately match the hospitals in each dataset the hospital’s Medicare ID code was used. Once the datasets were matched, the study outcomes, number of medical errors and mortality rates, were drawn from the HCUP data and the health IT stages was derived from the HIMSS data. The International Classification of Disease version 9 (ICD-9) codes were used to identify medical errors from the HCUP data. To address the primary and secondary objectives, both SAS and SPSS were utilized for data manipulation, data cleaning, and analysis. As part of the analysis descriptive statistics on hospital characteristics were assessed to determine the characteristics of hospitals at different stages of health IT implementation. Additionally, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the effects of health IT on medical errors and mortality rates. Finally multiple regression analysis was performed to determine if health IT stage is a predictor of medical errors and mortality rates. Results More than 530 hospitals were assessed for each of the four study years (2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011). Overall, US hospitals in three of the four years assessed support a significant difference in the mean number of medical errors between health IT stages within each year and for mortality rates all four years demonstrated the a significant amount of the variation in the model could be explained by health IT stage. Additionally, it was demonstrated that Stage 7 and Stage 0 were significantly different indicating that health IT stage can be a predictor for medical errors and mortality rates in three of the four years assessed. Conclusion This study demonstrates that there is an affect on quality of care, measured by medical errors and mortality rates, as it relates to the implementation of health IT. While the results are able to demonstrate this relationship between stages of health IT, further research is needed to assess health IT’s affects on hospital outcomes in greater detail. Additionally, the hospital characteristics associated with hospitals at various levels of health IT provides insight into the available resources for implementation of technology in the clinical setting.",2015,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: The Impact of Health Information Technology on Inpatient Medical Errors in US Hospitals ISBN: 9781339666808,,,,,Bioinformatics; Engineering; Health services administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem addressed in this qualitative case study was the need to understand the aging federal workforce and its effect on human capital. This study determined how the leaders of Air Force Base X (AFBX) [pseudonym] are addressing issues concerning the aging federal workforce. Data were collected using institutional records, interviews, and a researcher designed survey. General systems, open systems, and system thinking provided the theoretical frameworks for identifying systems archetypes. The participants included 118 federal employees and three military officers. An emergent strategy of thematic analysis was applied to combine, categorize, and code related patterns. Results indicated that AFBX leaders are managing human capital by initiating innovative and long-standing programs that: involve stakeholders; establish partnerships; build relationships; establish recruitment pipelines; invest in people; and perform long and short-range succession planning. However, the AFBX leaders are falling short in the areas of strategic alignment, knowledge management, and human capital accountability. The majority of federal employees in this study believed their leaders did not have a viable human capital strategy, and that their leaders are falling short in the areas of communication, talent management, and knowledge management. Recommendations were made to establish a central repository for human capital information, institute a scorecard system for measuring human capital programs, and encourage AFBX leaders to communicate and promote human capital strategies. The findings of the study could provide federal leaders with plans to better deal with the aging federal workforce phenomenon.",2009,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,Exploring the aging federal workforce and its effect on human capital,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Exploring the aging federal workforce and its effect on human capital: A case study ISBN: 9781109486537 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 11 Pages: 4448 Volume: 70,,,,,Aging; Executives; Human capital; Knowledge management; Leadership; Learned institutions and societies; Liability (Law); Management; Organizational behavior; Planning; Pressure groups; Public administration; Qualitative research; System theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CBL2PQ77,thesis,2018,"Kishimoto, Paul Natsuo; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems","Transport demand in China: estimation, projection, and policy assessment",,,,,,"China's rapid economic growth in the twenty-first century has driven, and been driven by, concomitant motorization and growth of passenger and freight mobility, leading to greater energy demand and environmental impacts. In this dissertation I develop methods to characterize the evolution of passenger transport demand in a rapidly-developing country, in order to support projection and policy assessment. In Essay #1, I study the role that vehicle tailpipe and fuel quality standards (""emissions standards"") can play vis-à-vis economy-wide carbon pricing in reducing emissions of pollutants that lead to poor air quality. I extend a global, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model resolving 30 Chinese provinces by separating freight and passenger transport subsectors, road and non-road modes, and household-owned vehicles; and then linking energy demand in these subsectors to a province-level inventory of primary pollutant emissions and future policy targets. While climate policy yields an air quality co-benefit by inducing shifts away from dirtier fuels, this effect is weak within the transport sector. Current emissions standards can drastically reduce transportation emissions, but their overall impact is limited by transport's share in total emissions, which varies across provinces. I conclude that the two categories of measures examined are complementary, and the effectiveness of emissions standards relies on enforcement in removing older, higher-polluting vehicles from the roads. In Essay #2, I characterize Chinese households' demand for transport by estimating the recently-developed, Exact affine Stone index (EASI) demand system on publicly-available data from non-governmental, social surveys. Flexible, EASI demands are particularly useful in China's rapidly-changing economy and transport system, because they capture ways that income elasticities of demand, and household transport budgets, vary with incomes; with population and road network densities; and with the supply of alternative transport modes. I find transport demand to be highly elastic ([epsilon][subscript x] = 1.46) at low incomes, and that income-elasticity of demand declines but remains greater than unity as incomes rise, so that the share of transport in households' spending rises monotonically from 1.6 % to 7.5 %; a wider, yet lower range than in some previous estimates. While no strong effects of city-level factors are identified, these and other non-income effects account for a larger portion of budget share changes than rising incomes. Finally, in Essay #3, I evaluate the predictive performance of the EASI demand system, by testing the sensitivity of model fit to the data available for estimation, in comparison with the less flexible, but widely used, Almost Ideal demand system (AIDS). In rapidly-evolving countries such as China, survey data without nationwide coverage can be used to characterize transport systems, but the omission of cities and provinces could bias results. To examine this possibility, I estimate demand systems on data subsets and test their predictions against observations for the withheld fraction. I find that simple EASI specifications slightly outperform AIDS under cross-validation; these offer a ready replacement in standalone and CGE applications. However, a trade-off exists between accuracy and the inclusion of policy-relevant covariates when data omit areas with high values of these variables. Also, while province-level fixed-effects control for unobserved heterogeneity across units that may bias parameter estimates, they increase prediction error in out-of-sample applications-revealing that the influence of local conditions on household transport expenditure varies significantly across China's provinces. The results motivate targeted transport data collection that better spans variation on city types and attributes; and the validation technique aids transport modelers in designing and validating demand specifications for projection and assessment.",2018,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,Transport demand in China,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2018 Ph.D.,"Book Title: Transport demand in China : estimation, projection, and policy assessment",,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The adoption of natural gas vehicles could lead to impacts on energy and environmental systems. An analysis of the main factors and trends that affect adoption of natural gas vehicles such as vehicle costs, infrastructure costs, and fuel economics was performed. The fuel cost analysis showed that assuming production and distribution at scale, liquefied natural gas (LNG) can be competitive as a diesel fuel substitute for heavy duty vehicles in the US, and also in EU and China. A methodology of incorporating heavy duty natural gas vehicles into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) economic modelling was developed to investigate the potential adoption and impacts. Modelling variables such as vehicle and infrastructure costs were tested and several scenarios were applied to examine the general equilibrium impacts on natural gas vehicle adoption and the general equilibrium impacts of resulting natural gas vehicle adoption. Climate policy scenarios were also developed and tested. In the base case scenario, results showed significant adoption of LNG trucks (Class 8) in the US, with 10% penetration of heavy duty trucks by 2020 and up to 100% by 2040. In China and the EU, adoption was projected to be slower due to higher natural gas prices. In the US, introduction of LNG trucks resulted in moderately higher natural gas prices, slightly lower oil prices, and a small reduction in total GHG emissions, relative to scenarios without LNG truck availability. The development of natural gas fuelled transportation is still in its infancy and CGE modelling offers a tool that can be applied to test a wide range of assumptions of cost development and relative prices.",2014,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Modelling the global prospects and impacts of heavy duty liquefied natural gas vehicles in computable general equilibrium,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this dissertation I use a foreign policy analysis framework to examine this question. I focus on examining each of the three primary levels of analysis in international relations as it relates to the main question. I begin with a typical international relations level and examine the characteristics of the two states that dominate the world arms trade: The United States and Russia. I then examine the full network of relations among all states in the international system that are involved in the sale or purchase of arms. To do this I use an Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) to examine these relations, which I derived from data on arms sales from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). I examine the arms sales in each decade from 1950 through 2010. In order to answer the question of how arms decisions are made within the state, I focus my inquiry on the United States and Russia. It is these states that have the practical capability to use arms transfers as a foreign policy tool. I examine the foreign policy making mechanisms in each of these states to determine how arms transfers can be used as a foreign policy tool. I examine and the bureaucratic institutions within each state and come up with a state ordering preference for how arms decisions are evaluated in each state. Finally, I use case studies to examine arms relations between the both the U.S. and Russia and three other states in each case. The other states were selected based on the pattern of sales between the two countries. I examine these sales to determine the impact of bureaucratic maneuvering and interest politics on the decision-making process within Russia and the United States. I find in my network analysis that the traditional measures of state power – military spending, regime type, and military alliances – do not account for the overall structure of the arms sale network. The most important factors in the formation of the arms sale network in each of the six decades that I study are specific configurations of triadic relations that suggest a continued hierarchy in the arms sale network. I find in my case study chapters that a simple model of state interest as a decision-making rule accounts for the decisions made by the different bureaucratic actors in the U.S. Russian arms sales are driven by a state imperative to increase Russia's market share, and there is high-level involvement in making different arms deals with other countries.",2013,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,Under the influence of arms,,,,,The University of Iowa,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Under the influence of arms: The foreign policy causes and consequences of arms transfers ISBN: 9781303181313 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 10 Volume: 74,,,,,Decision making; International relations; Learned institutions and societies; Political science; Russia; System analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation then applies these tools to study some of the most pressing subjects pertaining to air pollution in the U.S., including the energy transition away from coal, the increasing influence of wildfires on air quality and unhealthy pollution days, and environmental injustice regarding the disproportionate exposures to and health risks from particulate matter for vulnerable communities. The key takeaways herein are as follows. First, while air pollution in the U.S. has greatly declined since the passing of the Clean Air Act, damages are still extraordinary. This dissertation finds coal-fired power plants and wildland fires to cause air pollution damages on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars. Second, there is a paradigm shift regarding emission sources and the corresponding air pollution impacts in the U.S. While air pollution from most anthropogenic activities has greatly decreased, wildfire emissions are increasing. The implications are substantial for public health, regulatory compliance, and environmental modeling, as episodic events are the emergent threat. Third, there are substantial disparities in who is damaged by air pollution as well as who “wins” and “loses” as we continue to address the problem. The most vulnerable populations have historically been most impacted by emissions and substantially benefit from their reduction, whereas polluting industries and communities reliant on them are most at risk. That said, most stakeholders are better off with cleaner air, and innovative public policies can continue to achieve environmental progress while mitigating the losses. The study-specific findings herein are as follows. Both recent and potential benefits from coal’s decline far outweigh associated costs, and the government should fund policies supporting a swift and just clean energy transition. The marked net benefits of moving away from coal justify substantial investments in the hardest-hit communities. Daily PM2.5 variability is increasingly important, and the mathematical modeling of this phenomenon (conscious of challenges imposed by extreme wildfire events) can better inform air quality analysis and relevant decision-making. Finally, fire smoke is the new standout air pollution health risk in the U.S., and socially vulnerable populations are most exposed and damaged. Policymakers must consider the nexus of existing inequities and their influence on risk when devising solutions to address the deadly smoke.",2023,5/20/25 15:33,5/20/25 15:33,5/20/25 15:33,11278564 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 11278564 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Ecological Economics; Public Policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CLPHWDJE,thesis,2015,"Czaika, Ellen Gail; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Model use in sustainability negotiations and decisions,,,,,,"Sustainability negotiations and decisions require the integration of scientific information with stakeholder interests. Mathematical models help elucidate the physical world and therefore may orient the negotiators in a shared understanding of the physical world. Many researchers suggest collaborative modeling to facilitate integrating scientific information and stakeholder interests. In this thesis, I use methods that enable repeated instances of the same decision; the exploration of alternatives to model use (e.g. learning of a model's logic, relevant information, or irrelevant information); and the exploration of alternatives to collaborative modeling (e.g. using an expert model or not using a model). This thesis comprises two studies that use serious game role-play simulations. The first study is a computer-driven role-play simulation of governmental policy creation and the second is a five-party role-play simulation to negotiate a more sustainable end-of-life for used paper coffee cups. In the first study, model users reached the Pareto Frontier-the set of non-dominated points-more readily (13%) than non-model-users (2.5%) and model users discovered the win-win nature of electricity access with higher frequency (63%) than non-model users (9%). Participants who learned of the model's logic through presentation performed nearly as well as model users. In the second study, model use shortened the (mean) duration of the negotiation from 55 minutes to 45 minutes. Negotiating tables that co-created a model had a higher likelihood of reaching favorable agreements (44% compared to 25%). Model use did not significantly alter the value distribution among parties. Tables of negotiators used the model in two predominant manners: to test alternatives as they generated potential agreements and to verify a tentative agreement. The former resulted in higher mean table values than the latter. Together, these studies demonstrate: that mathematical models can be used in sustainability negotiations and decisions with good effect; that learning about the insights of a model is beneficial in decision making-but using a model is more beneficial; and that collaborative model building can provide better negotiation outcomes than using an expert model and can be faster than not using a model.",2015,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: Model use in sustainability negotiations and decisions,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LCAs are required as part of government regulations, used by companies to identify high resource use in their supply chain or to choose between product designs and by consumers to choose between alternative product choices. LCAs provide valuable information; however, they are resource intensive, time consuming and uncertain. Therefore, a methodology that addresses all these issues is needed. This study addresses the following question: Can LCAs be streamlined while still providing useful information? To answer this, an under-specification, probabilistic screening methodology is employed. The screening methodology uses a high level assessment of the footprint, incorporates uncertainty in the inputs, and refines data around the primary drivers of impact. The streamlined LCA procedure is extended to include a Sobol based sensitivity analysis methodology for identifying high impact activities. The effects of partial perfect information in subsequent data acquisition activities on the streamlining methodology are examined. Metrics to determine sufficiency in the data gathering procedure and to determine whether decision makers can sufficiently distinguish between two products or design alternatives are developed. A procedure to quantify the cost of additional information is developed. Finally, an exploration of the scenario space of the impacts is analyzed. The extended streamlined methodology is applied to a case study on tablets, with a focus on integrated circuits. This thesis finds that the streamlined, probabilistic methodology can be used to cost-effectively evaluate the environmental impact of products while still taking uncertainty into account. Metrics to determine sufficiency can be effectively used, and the presence of partial information does not limit the usefulness of the metrics. Furthermore, quantifying the cost of additional information can help determine sufficiency in data collection efforts and can help understand the challenges that companies face when performing an LCA.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,Development of metrics for streamlined life cycle assessments,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Development of metrics for streamlined life cycle assessments : a case study on tablets,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the 1960’s Western education came to Bhutan which already had a Buddhist monastic education system and an informal system using traditional methodologies. Currently all aspects of society, including education, are being aligned to Bhutan’s development policy based on Gross National Happiness (GNH). Data for this qualitative research study was collected through interviews in Bhutan and ongoing communication with Bhutanese educators and school reformers. Eight people educated only or first through traditional methodologies were interviewed as well as six who had a combination of Western and traditional education. Three common themes emerged across groups: (1) formal learning was seen as related to spiritual/moral development, (2) experiences of learning were associated with a sense of meaning and personal/internal motivation, and (3) alphabetic literacy was seen to be strongly related to formal learning. Also common to all groups was participation in some type of non-Western learning methodology. Further study of such experiences seems very relevant to creating an education system in Bhutan based on GNH. The navigation processes of two education organizations in Bhutan were also compared and contrasted. Both face similar issues but have very different functions and goals. The Institute of Language and Cultural Studies (ILCS) began as a monastic school for lay people and is now part of the Royal University of Bhutan. In its process of change, it has retained its traditional languages and monastic curriculum while adding a more student-centered pedagogy, study of the English language, and technology. The Royal Education Council (REC) is a temporary organization commissioned by the King to align the education system with GNH. The work of the REC is to reform the current imported Western style system to form a new system based on student-centered models which incorporates traditional values and prepares students to function in the broader world. Study of this navigation can inform Western educators about the conscious process of school reform.",2009,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Navigating Learning in Bhutan, Land of the Thunder Dragon ISBN: 9781109329964 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 9 Pages: 3300 Volume: 70",,,,,"Education, Bilingual; School management and organization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CQQITJMC,thesis,2016,"Quintana, Frankie Catota",Cybersecurity Capabilities in a Critical Infrastructure Sector of a Developing Nation,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Cybersecurity_Capabilities_in_a_Critical_Infrastructure_Sector_of_a_Developing_Nation/6715514/1,"When information technology is incorporated into the operations of financial critical infrastructure, it brings with it a range of cyber risks, and mitigating them requires that firms and regulators develop capabilities to foster protection. The sophistication of cyber threats to the financial sector has been growing rapidly. Developed nations have worked hard to improve their knowledge of these threats and establish strategies to respond accordingly. However, in developing nations, both the understanding of the risks posed by cyber threats and the ability to address those risks have been slower to evolve. Developing the needed cybersecurity capabilities in developing countries encounter challenges that need to be identified and addressed. In order to begin to do that, this thesis reports on three studies conducted in the context of Ecuador. The first study identifies and assesses incident experiences, challenges, barriers, and desired actions reported by financial security managers with the objective of identifying strategies to enhance incident response capabilities. The second study begins with the security incidents reported by the Ecuadorian financial stakeholders during the first study and assesses the potential effectiveness of the government policy that is intended to address IT risk in the financial sector. The third study explores the challenges that universities face in order to provide cybersecurity instruction to protect critical infrastructure and explores potential strategies to advance cybersecurity education at the university level. In support of this work we collected data from national practitioners involved in responding to security incidents and in developing cybersecurity skills. Sixty-one in-depth, semi-structured interviews across five cities were conducted (95% in person, the rest by telephone) with respondents who had good knowledge in the subjects. Respondents come mainly from: the financial sector (CISOs, risk and IT managers, security chiefs, security officers, authorities); telecommunications sector, especially ISPs (managers, directors, engineers, authorities); and academia (deans, directors, professors). We transcribed all the interviews, coded them and conducted qualitative text analysis. This research finds that (1) the financial sector is already facing risks driven by outsiders and insiders that lead to fraud and operational errors and failures. The main barriers to improving protection are small team size, network visibility, inadequate internal coordination, technology updating, lack of training, and lack of awareness. The sector has little community support to respond to incidents, and the national legal framework has not supported appropriate prosecution of cyber criminals; (2) the national IT risk management policy has reasonably covered most countermeasures related to reported security incidents. There are however, several areas of gap, one of the most important is network security, which can enable sophisticated malware attacks; (3) today the level of cybersecurity education is mostly elementary in Ecuador. Academic interviewees at only four of the thirteen universities studied expressed confidence that they can provide students with reasonable preparation. Ecuador needs to design a national cybersecurity plan that prioritizes protection for critical infrastructure and should support strategies that allow the country to enhance cybersecurity capabilities. Properly designed these initiatives should allow the nation to develop a core structure to confront current and emergent cyber challenges in the financial sector and other critical national operations, and build the human resources necessary to continue that effort.",12/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715514.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CSQW4ZIC,thesis,2015,"Wolff, Josephine Charlotte Paulina; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",Classes of defense for computer systems,,,,,,"Computer security incidents often involve attackers acquiring a complex sequence of escalating capabilities and executing those capabilities across a range of different intermediary actors in order to achieve their ultimate malicious goals. However, popular media accounts of these incidents, as well as the ensuing litigation and policy proposals, tend to focus on a very narrow defensive landscape, primarily individual centralized defenders who control some of the capabilities exploited in the earliest stages of these incidents. This thesis proposes two complementary frameworks for defenses against computer security breaches -- one oriented around restricting the computer-based access capabilities that adversaries use to perpetrate those breaches and another focused on limiting the harm that those adversaries ultimately inflict on their victims. Drawing on case studies of actual security incidents, as well as the past decade of security incident data at MIT, it analyzes security roles and defense design patterns related to these broad classes of defense for application designers, administrators, and policy-makers. Application designers are well poised to undertake access defense by defining and distinguishing malicious and legitimate forms of activity in the context of their respective applications. Policy-makers can implement some harm limitation defenses by monitoring and regulating money flows, and also play an important role in collecting the data needed to expand understanding of the sequence of events that lead up to successful security incidents and inform which actors can and should effectively intervene as defenders. Organizations and administrators, meanwhile, occupy an in-between defensive role that spans both access and harm in addressing digital harms, or harms that are directly inflicted via computer capabilities, through restrictions on crucial intermediate harms and outbound information flows. The comparative case analysis ultimately points to a need to broaden defensive roles and responsibilities beyond centralized access defense and defenders, as well as the visibility challenges compounding externalities for defenders who may lack not only the incentives to intervene in such incidents but also the necessary knowledge to figure out how best to intervene.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology, Management, and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: Classes of defense for computer systems,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CVJP3ZL5,thesis,2014,"Yip, Arthur Hong Chun; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Modelling the global prospects and impacts of heavy duty liquefied natural gas vehicles in computable general equilibrium,,,,,,"Natural gas vehicles have the prospects of making substantial contributions to transportation needs. The adoption of natural gas vehicles could lead to impacts on energy and environmental systems. An analysis of the main factors and trends that affect adoption of natural gas vehicles such as vehicle costs, infrastructure costs, and fuel economics was performed. The fuel cost analysis showed that assuming production and distribution at scale, liquefied natural gas (LNG) can be competitive as a diesel fuel substitute for heavy duty vehicles in the US, and also in EU and China. A methodology of incorporating heavy duty natural gas vehicles into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) economic modelling was developed to investigate the potential adoption and impacts. Modelling variables such as vehicle and infrastructure costs were tested and several scenarios were applied to examine the general equilibrium impacts on natural gas vehicle adoption and the general equilibrium impacts of resulting natural gas vehicle adoption. Climate policy scenarios were also developed and tested. In the base case scenario, results showed significant adoption of LNG trucks (Class 8) in the US, with 10% penetration of heavy duty trucks by 2020 and up to 100% by 2040. In China and the EU, adoption was projected to be slower due to higher natural gas prices. In the US, introduction of LNG trucks resulted in moderately higher natural gas prices, slightly lower oil prices, and a small reduction in total GHG emissions, relative to scenarios without LNG truck availability. The development of natural gas fuelled transportation is still in its infancy and CGE modelling offers a tool that can be applied to test a wide range of assumptions of cost development and relative prices.",2014,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Modelling the global prospects and impacts of heavy duty liquefied natural gas vehicles in computable general equilibrium,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CZGMWLPE,thesis,2009,"Farrell, Tina L.",The Early College High School and Student Self-Perceptions of College Readiness,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/528024491?pq-origsite=primo,"High schools in the United States represent the stepping-off point to adulthood, the threshold for students to enter formal training in college, trade school, or the workforce. As our society faces increased demands for creative solutions, innovation, and a more technological workforce, the current high school model is simply antiquated. The Early College High School (ECHS) design can bridge the transitional gap that exists between high school and college and increase the potential of higher graduation rates in high school and post-secondary institutes and is one of many responses to these concerns. This mixed-methods study sought to discover students' self-perceptions of college readiness in the areas of academics, expectations, and emotions as a result of participating in an ECHS. The academic readiness was examined through an analysis of student reflections on academic readiness on the ""Perceptions, Expectations, Emotions, and Knowledge"" about college (PEEK) scales (Weinstein, Palmer & Hanson, 1995) instrument and their college entrance examination scores derived from the ""Computer-Adaptive Placement Assessment Support System"" (COMPASS) (ACT, 2006) examination.

D2VZGS4K,thesis,2017,"Song, Jeffery W.",Making Sense of the Noise: Statistical Analysis of Environmental DNA Sampling for Invasive Asian Carp Monitoring Near the Great Lakes,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Making_Sense_of_the_Noise_Statistical_Analysis_of_Environmental_DNA_Sampling_for_Invasive_Asian_Carp_Monitoring_Near_the_Great_Lakes/6720470/1,"Sensitive and accurate detection methods are critical for monitoring and managing the spread of aquatic invasive species, such as invasive Silver Carp (SC; Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and Bighead Carp (BH; Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) near the Great Lakes. A new detection tool called environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling, the collection and screening of water samples for the presence of the target species’ DNA, promises improved detection sensitivity compared to conventional surveillance methods. However, the application of eDNA sampling for invasive species management has been challenging due to the potential of false positives, from detecting species’ eDNA in the absence of live organisms. In this dissertation, I study the sources of error and uncertainty in eDNA sampling and develop statistical tools to show how eDNA sampling should be utilized for monitoring and managing invasive SC and BH in the United States. In chapter 2, I investigate the environmental and hydrologic variables, e.g. reverse flow, that may be contributing to positive eDNA sampling results upstream of the electric fish dispersal barrier in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), where live SC are not expected to be present. I used a beta-binomial regression model, which showed that reverse flow volume across the barrier has a statistically significant positive relationship with the probability of SC eDNA detection upstream of the barrier from 2009 to 2012 while other covariates, such as water temperature, season, chlorophyll concentration, do not. This is a potential alternative explanation for why SC eDNA has been detected upstream of the barrier but intact SC have not. In chapter 3, I develop and parameterize a statistical model to evaluate how changes made to the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)’s eDNA sampling protocols for invasive BH and SC monitoring from 2013 to 2015 have influenced their sensitivity. The model shows that changes to the protocol have caused the sensitivity to fluctuate. Overall, when assuming that eDNA is randomly distributed, the sensitivity of the current protocol is higher for BH eDNA detection and similar for SC eDNA detection compared to the original protocol used from 2009-2012. When assuming that eDNA is clumped, the sensitivity of the current protocol is slightly higher for BH eDNA detection but worse for SC eDNA detection. In chapter 4, I apply the model developed in chapter 3 to estimate the BH and SC eDNA concentration distributions in two pools of the Illinois River where BH and SC are considered to be present, one pool where they are absent, and upstream of the electric barrier in the CAWS given eDNA sampling data and knowledge of the eDNA sampling protocol used in 2014. The results show that the estimated mean eDNA concentrations in the Illinois River are highest in the invaded pools (La Grange; Marseilles) and are lower in the uninvaded pool (Brandon Road). The estimated eDNA concentrations in the CAWS are much lower compared to the concentrations in the Marseilles pool, which indicates that the few eDNA detections in the CAWS (3% of samples positive for SC and 0.4% samples positive for BH) do not signal the presence of live BH or SC. The model shows that >50% samples positive for BH or SC eDNA are needed to infer AC presence in the CAWS, i.e., that the estimated concentrations are similar to what is found in the Marseilles pool. Finally, in chapter 5, I develop a decision tree model to evaluate the value of information that monitoring provides for making decisions about BH and SC prevention strategies near the Great Lakes. The optimal prevention strategy is dependent on prior beliefs about the expected damage of AC invasion, the probability of invasion, and whether or not BH and SC have already invaded the Great Lakes (which is informed by monitoring). Given no monitoring, the optimal strategy is to stay with the status quo of operating electric barriers in the CAWS for low probabilities of invasion and low expected invasion costs. However, if the probability of invasion is greater than 30% and the cost of invasion is greater than $100 million a year, the optimal strategy changes to installing an additional barrier in the Brandon Road pool. Greater risk-aversion (i.e., aversion to monetary losses) causes less prevention (e.g., status quo instead of additional barriers) to be preferred. Given monitoring, the model shows that monitoring provides value for making this decision, only if the monitoring tool has perfect specificity (false positive rate = 0%).",5/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Making Sense of the Noise,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720470.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though the creation of this internal energy market requires attention to flexibility and strategic decision-making, existing literature and practitioners have not given proper attention to these topics. Using portfolios of real options, we present two stochastic mixed integer linear programming models for transmission network expansion planning. We study the importance of explicitly addressing uncertainties, the option to postpone decisions and other sources of flexibility in the design of transmission networks. In a case study based on the Azores archipelago we show how renewables penetration can increase by introducing contingency planning into the decision process considering generation capacity uncertainty. We also present a two-party Nash-Coase bargaining transmission capacity investment model. We illustrate optimal fair share cost allocation policies with a case study based on the Iberian market. Lastly, we develop a new model that considers both interconnection expansion planning under uncertainty and cross-border cost allocation based on portfolios of real options and Nash-Coase bargaining.

Use of P2P and transfers of copyrighted content were widespread on campus. In Spring 2008, 40% of students living on campus were detected using a P2P protocol, 70% of which were observed attempting to transfer copyrighted material. In late 2010, we estimate that over 800 million copies of content were transferred globally using BitTorrent per day, with an estimated number of transferred songs 13.1 times greater than worldwide sales of songs, and estimated number of transferred movies 6.8 times greater than worldwide box-office sales and 16.4 times greater than U.S. DVD and Blu-ray sales. Most transfers were from a small number of very popular titles that were widely available for sale. We found no evidence that use of P2P to transfer content without violating copyright was common both on campus and global BitTorrent. This indicates that copyright law is violated frequently using P2P, and while we cannot quantify how P2P transfers translate to lost sales, it is reasonable to assume some sales are lost due to P2P. Focusing on effectiveness of DPI, after a couple weeks of monitoring DPI found up to 80% of detected P2P users attempting to transfer copyrighted content. In the short term, DPI could be effective to assess which network users transfer copyrighted content using P2P given some weeks of monitoring. However, limitations such as not being able to detect users of encrypted P2P can reduce DPIʼs effectiveness in the long term. Using behavioral classifiers that we implemented and that can detect encrypted BitTorrent from traffic summaries, we found students shifting from unencrypted to encrypted BitTorrent in the 2007-2008 academic year. If this trend continues, effectiveness of DPI for enforcement can be significantly hindered",8/1/11,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Copyright Violation on the Internet,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715397.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The massive disruptive challenges call for telecom companies to react with efficient strategic managerial policies. Meanwhile, how consumer decision makings and welfare are impacted by such policies often remains complicated and non-transparent to policy makers. My thesis aims at leveraging large-scale empirical data to investigate the impacts of several prevalent firm initiated strategies on both sides of the market, i.e. consumers and firms. The thesis is comprised of three studies focusing on consumer switch, search and purchase behaviors. The first study, centering at consumer switching behaviors, investigates the impact of lock in shortening policies on both firm profits and consumer welfare in home-based telecommunication service market. Using household level data from a large telecommunications service provider, we show that a market level policy that shortens the lock-in period from the status quo can decrease the profits on the firms side more than it increases consumer surplus. This is majorly caused by the substantial acquisition costs associated with user switching and service initiation. As a result if regulators shorten lock-in periods but then firms respond by collaboratively increasing prices to recover their rate of return, the consumers, as the analyses indicate, may be worse off compared to the world in which lock-in periods do not change. Therefore lock-in reduction policy need to be paired with a policy precluding operators from increasing prices too much. The later two studies jointly examine consumer’s search and purchase behaviors in social environment. With a wide scope of services, telecommunication service providers can often leverage their knowledge on consumer’s social environment to reshape consumer choices. We aim to understand how consumers combine different sources of social information, one from friends versus one from the crowd, as a function of how close they are to the point of conversion. We developed a dynamic structural econometric model that jointly describes consumer information search and product purchase while taking into account sequential arrival of information and non-negligible search costs. The model is then instantiated on two connected yet distinct empirical contexts, where consumers shop for movies to watch on home screens. The first empirical context (discussed in the second study in this thesis) lies in an observational setting, where we studied individual level clickstream and transactional data from a Video-on- Demand service platform operated by a large telecommunication service provider. Later in the third study, we created an artificial movie market and leveraged a randomized web experiment to further study the research questions with more solid identification support. We find that, in both contexts, consumers seem to start by browsing products they heard about from friends. The popularity signals become more relevant when consumers getting closer to the point of purchase. The results have important managerial implications to online vendors by suggesting a reasonable strategy of providing the most valuable social information at the right time to enhance consumer shopping experiences.",5/1/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,Essays on Telecommunications Management,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716456.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DCYIDDPG,thesis,2010,"Elkina, Olga Sergeevna",Economic Behaviour of Workers in the Labour Market: Strategies and Trends,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2321017624?pq-origsite=primo,"Relevance of the research topic. In recent years, the problems of strategic development of Russia, stimulated interest in the study of economic behavior, based on the fact that economic behavior determines the actions of people and their reactions, which are responsible for changes in the market, and is a tool to predict the results of various changes in the most important components of any market. The effectiveness of reforms depends not least on the adequacy of the integration and adaptation of the most important components of human behavior in modern economic relations and institutions that have generated new types of economic behavior that have a significant impact on the economy, but have not been studied enough. A special need for knowledge of the economic behavior of the employee has a scientific field that studies the labor market. The priority need is explained by the fact that the situation in the labor market has an impact on the processes of economic development and largely determines their intensity. Thus, in modern conditions there is an urgent need to monitor the economic behavior of a person, his reaction to the change of priorities of social development, change in the nature of labor relations, and as a result – to predict changes in the labor market in the conditions of dynamic development of society. And the basis for the choice of methods of resolving problems and ways of regulating the labor market should be based on an understanding of how the economic decision is made by the subject in the social and labor sphere. The choice of a specific economic decision by the employee is primarily due to the purpose of directing his actions, and which he adheres to in the sphere of labor relations for a relatively long time. This goal defines the causes and orientation of work, the choice of type of employment and the specific workplace and is reflected in the strategies of economic behavior. This strategy determines the compatibility of the employee with working conditions, acceptable conditions for the use of labor potential, determines its cost-compensatory nature of relations with the company, the amount of labor productivity, and so on. At the same time, the strategies of economic behavior of the employee are formed as a result of the influence of various factors acting both on the part of the employee and on the part of the labor market as a whole. All these factors are dynamic and unstable in modern conditions. Therefore, the effectiveness of management actions on the labor market is determined by the ability to predict and influence the strategy of economic behavior of employees. Understanding the strategies of economic behavior of employees, will create new models of work motivation, encouraging modern workers to efficient and high-performance work, and leading to the set management goals while minimizing costs through the use of sustainable employee goals. The undeveloped theoretical and methodological approaches and tools aimed at studying the strategies of economic behavior of workers in the labor market, determines the relevance of the chosen topic. The degree of development of the problem. The existing theoretical and methodological approaches develop the conceptual apparatus, reveal the essence and content of economic behavior, determine the directions of research and management of economic behavior. Despite the fact that the existing scientific approaches have made a significant contribution to the explanation of the causes and mechanisms of economic behavior, the impact of behavior on a particular market, on the efficiency of economic activity, many topical issues still remain unresolved. In particular, in the field of labour market research, the focus of research is on the study of labour behaviour, labour activity, gender segregation, psychological factors of job satisfaction, mobility and workers ' movements. The literature presents a limited range of theoretical models of strategies of economic behavior, differentiated by branches of scientific knowledge and methodological approaches to the study, resulting in their findings are poorly coordinated with each other, and sometimes contradictory. In addition, there is a substitution of definitions when the strategy is understood as a trend of behavior in certain conditions, rather than actions aimed at achieving a long-term goal. The very economic behavior of the employee is reduced to the choice of the duration of employment under a given system of payment and working conditions, and there are no studies where labor costs are estimated comprehensively, not only from the quantitative side, but also from the qualitative side. The presence of different, inconsistent models, due to the lack of a mechanism for identifying behavior with a certain strategy of economic behavior, the methodology for measuring the strategies themselves, due to the lack of development of the General theory of economic behavior of the employee in the labor market as a form of implementation of labor. However, it is in the labor market that the economic interests of various subjects (labor carriers, employers, organizations, the region) collide, which determine their behavior in the economic system of society. All this puts before science the task of understanding and studying the patterns of implementation of economic behavior of the employee as an economic entity in the labor market. Describing the reasons why the study of economic behavior and strategies of workers is not an established subject area of domestic economic science, Russian researchers point to an underestimation of the elasticity of behavior of workers in the labor market in research, with the established assumptions that the dynamics and trends in the labor market are determined by demand. But there is another set of factors that constrain the study of economic behavior of workers in the labor market. Economic analysis of processes related to economic behavior suggests the presence of microdata bases. Limited number of databases microdata, revealing the dimensions of the economic behavior of workers, and especially their strategies, just acts as a deterrent. The author sees the solution of these problems in the integration of different approaches to the analysis of such a complex socio-economic phenomenon, which is possible within the framework of a systematic approach that allows a comprehensive approach to solving these problems. The importance of the problem of improving the ways to regulate the labor market on the basis of typical models of employee behavior for the theory and practice of forming an effective social policy, as well as its complexity and scale require serious theoretical understanding, methodological and methodological developments, primarily on the basis of a systematic approach to its solution. The purpose of the study is to develop the concept of economic behavior strategies of employees on the basis of a systematic approach to the labor market and to substantiate the concept of management of development of economic behavior strategies of employees in order to stabilize or change the current state of the labor market. The object of research economic behavior in the labor market as a theoretical and methodological scientific field, studying the labor market from the standpoint of cost-compensation nature of human relations and society, and reveals trends and patterns of labor, labor supply, distribution and use of labor resources The subject of the study of the strategy of economic behavior of workers in the labor market as a form of implementation of economic behavior in the labor market.

However, there is  a risk of continuing historical inequities (e.g., air pollution burden disparities) from the current  power system into the future. In this dissertation, I quantify sustainability and equality impacts  from different decarbonization pathways in the U.S. These analyses show how decarbonization  decisions may impact different demographic groups and how different goals of  decarbonization may have trade-offs between sustainability outcomes. In Chapter 2, I quantify  the air pollution disparities across regions and demographic groups across eight  decarbonization scenarios. I tie a capacity expansion model to a reduced complexity air  pollution model to capture community level impacts. I provide policy implications given the  differences in air pollution disparities across demographics and decarbonization scenarios.  This chapter lays a framework for evaluating equality in air pollution impacts given national  level decarbonization decisions. In Chapter 3, I evaluate the trade-offs across sustainability  criteria for 32 decarbonization outcomes in 2050. I look at economic, environmental, and social  sustainability across eleven unique stakeholder preference scenarios. Under social  sustainability, I specifically focus on distributional equality criteria. I also discuss the impacts  of policies on overall sustainability performance in 2050. In Chapter 4, I evaluate how different  spatial resolution and downscaling methodologies, which have been used to estimate air  pollution burden across race/ethnicity groups resulting from national level decarbonization  decisions, impact the estimated magnitude of burden across groups. I look across four different  sensitivities and quantify how the spatial resolution of data will impact outcomes of air  pollution burden.

Venting and flaring of associated natural gas represents significant environmental and financial losses yet it continues in the North Dakota Bakken oil play. The valuable gas resource is wasted due to unfavorable economics and limited pipeline capacity. Similarly in India, underdeveloped gas transport infrastructure and restrictive regulatory frameworks prevent distribution and marketing of natural gas from the northeast regions, leaving it stranded in marginal fields. This thesis establishes a techno-economic model, utilizing Aspen Plus chemical processing software, and a discounted cash flow model to estimate economic feasibility of implementing MIT engine reformer-based gas-to-liquids (GTL) systems in the US or India. The system reforms natural gas via partial oxidation into synthesis gas (syngas) in the cylinders of an internal combustion engine, and can significantly reduce capital costs over conventional GTL reforming processes. The engine is operated in fuel rich conditions to generate the syngas, which is synthesized into methanol and dimethyl ether (DME). Once produced on-site, these liquids are more easily transported than gases. This study assesses the regulatory structures surrounding the upstream methane resource and downstream end product marketability for three scenarios: use of DME to replace existing local (1) diesel and (2) liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or (3) sale of methanol as a commodity chemical on domestic or global markets. The analysis shows the system is economical in both locations. In the US, the minimum economically efficient production capacity with a 1-2 year payback period is 400,000- 860,000 standard cubic feet per day (scfpd) of natural gas for the range of end use scenarios considered. Differences in costs and product market characteristics in India result in a minimum efficient capacity of 330,000-810,000 scfpd of natural gas for the three scenarios.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: System model of small-scale gas-to-methanol conversion by engine reformers,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Organizations in the private, public and social sectors are working together to tackle society’s most wicked problems. Some success has resulted in a generalized belief that cross-sector collaborations represent the new paradigm to manage complex problems. Yet, important knowledge gaps remain about how cross-sector alliances generate value for society, particularly to its beneficiaries. This study answers the question: How does cross-sector collaboration affect its beneficiary’s capacity for collective action? It uses a qualitative embedded case study design, and theoretical sampling of two general cases of alliance-based interventions in a developing country: Colombia. Two embedded cases within each general case identify evidence of collective action capacity of the beneficiaries. The study’s findings speak to the management literatures studying collective action at different levels of analysis. Key contributions include a Beneficiaries’ Capacity Building and Expressing Model, which identifies the drivers that lead to collective action, and provide a conceptualization of collective action as installed and realized capacity. Findings also identify and explain alliances’ contributions to beneficiaries’ capacity building: alliances are trust brokers and they create spaces. Alliances also enable beneficiaries to release or actualize that capacity by building bridges, allowing capitals’ circulation and becoming a relational buffer to protect people’s initiatives. Beneficiaries increased capacity for collective action is an outcome that becomes an alliance input, leading overtime to further benefits involving systemic change. Beneficiaries’ increased collective action capacity is a prerequisite to produce changes in larger systems of public policy and/or markets, but beneficiaries need to continue working in collaboration with the alliance as a whole system. The research features a complex collaborative system that changes how actors mobilize resources to generate systemic change. Building on those findings the study also offers an outcome-based conceptualization of alliances value creation at the beneficiary level of analysis.",2016,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,Value Creation in Cross-Sector Collaboration,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Value Creation in Cross-Sector Collaboration: Beneficiaries' Increased Capacity for Collective Action ISBN: 9781369086607,,,,,Alliances; Beneficiaries; Cooperation; Logic; Management; Peace; Political planning; Profit; Public policy; Qualitative research; Research institutes; Social networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By collecting, organizing, and analyzing the survey data set, the research attempts to identify series of workplace autonomy policies and work task characteristics that are appealing to the targeted demographics. The thesis analyzes the respondent dataset using three approaches. Firstly, chisquared tests suggest that the dataset exhibits similar job characteristic preference patterns within each demographic dimension (i.e. generation, gender, household composition, education and professional backgrounds). Secondly, conditional probability tests indicate respondents' acquisition and retention rates associated with specific policies. Lastly, the cross-tabulated contingency tables summarize the insights for optimizing performance review frequency and methods.

The current accuracy of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) technique is below centimetre level and this allows very accurate determination of velocity field parameters. This study focused on utilizing GNSS to determine the intercontinental plate velocity field for Africa in support of the African Geodetic Reference Frame (AFREF). Data spanning 12.4 years were processed in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2008) using GAMIT/GLOBK 10.4 (developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Primarily, processing of data focused on International GNSS Service (IGS) stations with a few non-IGS stations (which are of geodetic quality) included, such as Hamburg (HAMB) and Matjiesfontein (MATJ). The same data set was analysed using the Combination and Analyses of Terrestrial Reference Frame (CATREF) software developed at Institut National de l’Information Géographique et Forestière (IGN). Validation of the results was achieved through comparison of the velocity solution from this study with a solution obtained from a core of IGS GNSS stations processed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). No significant differences were evident between the GAMIT/GLOBK 10.4, CATREF and JPL solutions. The results from the Matjiesfontein station indicated that the proposed Matjiesfontein Observatory site shows no significant vertical or horizontal local motion; this information is valuable in that there is no obvious local site instability. The velocity field as derived by GNSS displays no unexpected deviations and supports current understanding of the motion of the Nubian, Somalian and Arabian plates. Furthermore, the comparison of the velocity vectors derived from the IGS station HRAO, Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) MOBLAS-6 station and 26 m Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) telescope, which are collocated at the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO) indicated good agreement and both techniques exhibit no significant vertical motion. This study also contributed to the first computation of the AFREF solution. It is envisaged that as more stations are added to the sparsely distributed current network, more accurate results and better tectonic models can be derived. The availability of station velocities will facilitate adjustments within the AFREF.",2013,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Determination of geodetic velocity field parameters for the African tectonic plate using the technique of Global Navigation Satellite Systems ISBN: 9781321956054,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DMRRUEQ2,journalArticle,2023,"Tschofen, Peter",Essays in Pollution Accounting,,,,10.1184/R1/23563593.V1,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Essays_in_Pollution_Accounting/23563593/1,"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles smaller than 2.5 μm in diameter) air pollution poses a major risk to public health across the world. While the global burden of exposure to PM2.5 has remained persistently high, some regions – particularly in rich countries in the Western hemisphere – have seen more encouraging signs of progress in reducing impacts. This thesis documents some of this progress for the United States over the last 15 years (focusing primarily on PM2.5 with the exception of Chapter 2), and explores patterns that have started to emerge in more recent years that may inhibit further reductions or indeed point to a potential reversal in trends. In Chapter 1, the thesis provides a broad overview of sectoral contributors to monetized air pollution impacts, which we term gross external damage (GED), in the United States from 2008 to 2014. It notes trends such as the continuation of a steep decline in GED from the utilities sector as well as sectors such as manufacturing which exhibit modest increases in GED coinciding with the economic recovery after the financial crisis. The chapter also highlights that GED in the agriculture sector did not follow a comparable trajectory and instead remained largely stagnant over this time period. In addition to sectoral totals the chapter presents GED to value added (VA) at various sectoral scales. The damage intensities computed thusly provide an indication of a more accurate representation of economic performance because they account for environmental damage caused by economic activity.Chapter 2 expands on the work from Chapter 1 by incorporating GED from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and damages and updating the estimates to 2017. A modified sectoral categorization and the inclusion of residential activities and wildfires add more comprehensive estimates of the damages caused by human activities to the picture. GED from wildfires in particular (which are not only caused by humans) have increased substantially in recent years, and this trend has been especially pronounced in Western states. They now constitute a larger share of economy-wide GED than every economic sector, and recent evidence suggests that heavy wildfire seasons cause profound negative impacts to the United States economy. This chapter also argues strongly in favor of the power of regulation as a means to lower environmental impacts from economic activities. Sectors and pollutants that are tightly regulated, such as electricity generation or non-carbon pollutants emitted from transportation, are seeing the most success in lowering emissions and damages, whereas agriculture, a sector with precious few regulations on air pollutant emissions, is seeing hardly any progress. In some sectors (particularly in transportation), GHG GED are on an upward trajectory while GED from PM2.5 are falling, offering perhaps the clearest evidence of regulatory efficacy. The last chapter of this thesis provides detailed estimates of industrial GED within the agriculture sector at a national, state and metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level for 2011, 2014 and 2017. It improves upon the attribution method used to compute agriculture GED in Chapter 1 and thus provides more geographic and sectoral detail. Once again GED is compared with economic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) or VA, which adds nuance to the results. GED intensities by area differ significantly from GED compared to economic value. One key insight from this chapter is the strong concentration of agriculture GED from activities near population centers ¬ approximately half of all agriculture GED is a result of emissions that occur within the boundaries of metro areas. Overall, the thesis documents some encouraging trends in reducing the impacts from air pollution in the United States over the last decade and more, yet also identifies areas where progress has been mixed, muted, or even non-existent, and should therefore provide policymakers in the United States with useful information when it comes to designing the future regulatory framework for dealing with air pollution. <pre><code><br></code></pre>",2023,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,3386329 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 3386329 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DR3ZHDR7,thesis,2009,"Campos, Norma Viviana; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program","Encouraging technology transition through value creation, capture and delivery strategies: the case of data link in the North Atlantic airspace",,,,,,"This thesis studies the problem of data link in the NAT under a technology transition framework of value creation, capture, and delivery. Creating value through a new technology, such as data link, refers to designing competitive value propositions for stakeholders. Capturing value means recovering an investment in a technology through the value it creates. Delivering value refers to developing policies and business strategies to enable value capture. Realization of these concepts is necessary to guarantee technology transition. Data was gathered from a survey of the two major stakeholder groups in the NAT, commercial operators and ANSPs. The survey covered five major research areas: 1) Perceived operational and coordination inefficiencies; 2) Opportunities to improve service; 3) Current and projected data link equipage and infrastructure in the NAT; 4) Value distribution of data link costs and benefits; and 5) Potential policy strategies to encourage data link adoption. The study found that data link creates value for stakeholders through an understanding of the evolution of technology and stakeholder needs. Fuel penalties associated with flying suboptimal flight levels and routes is the largest inefficiency in the NAT. Data link, particularly through the FANS system, is seen as the enabling technology to improve efficiency of operations. Reducing separation is the data link application most valued by stakeholders., (cont.) Coordination and harmonization issues threaten to limit the value created. Data link diffusion (airborne equipage and ground infrastructure) is not always guaranteed as a result of value created due to improvements in technical performance. Value capture is limited due to unbalances in the distribution of data link costs and benefits. So far, data link operational benefits have been significant but have not yet translated into economic benefits given that such applications have not been implemented in the NAT. Delivering value from data link is more than balancing costs and benefits. Uncertainty in a number of issues needs resolution before the value created through data link could be fully captured and delivered. A combination of operational, financial and regulatory schemes may be necessary to leverage costs and benefits and ensure successful data link value delivery to all stakeholders.",2009,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,"Encouraging technology transition through value creation, capture and delivery strategies",,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2009 S.M.,"Book Title: Encouraging technology transition through value creation, capture and delivery strategies : the case of data link in the North Atlantic airspace",,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this dissertation I use a foreign policy analysis framework to examine this question. I focus on examining each of the three primary levels of analysis in international relations as it relates to the main question. I begin with a typical international relations level and examine the characteristics of the two states that dominate the world arms trade: The United States and Russia. I then examine the full network of relations among all states in the international system that are involved in the sale or purchase of arms. To do this I use an Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) to examine these relations, which I derived from data on arms sales from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). I examine the arms sales in each decade from 1950 through 2010. In order to answer the question of how arms decisions are made within the state, I focus my inquiry on the United States and Russia. It is these states that have the practical capability to use arms transfers as a foreign policy tool. I examine the foreign policy making mechanisms in each of these states to determine how arms transfers can be used as a foreign policy tool. I examine and the bureaucratic institutions within each state and come up with a state ordering preference for how arms decisions are evaluated in each state. Finally, I use case studies to examine arms relations between the both the U.S. and Russia and three other states in each case. The other states were selected based on the pattern of sales between the two countries. I examine these sales to determine the impact of bureaucratic maneuvering and interest politics on the decision-making process within Russia and the United States. I find in my network analysis that the traditional measures of state power – military spending, regime type, and military alliances – do not account for the overall structure of the arms sale network. The most important factors in the formation of the arms sale network in each of the six decades that I study are specific configurations of triadic relations that suggest a continued hierarchy in the arms sale network. I find in my case study chapters that a simple model of state interest as a decision-making rule accounts for the decisions made by the different bureaucratic actors in the U.S. Russian arms sales are driven by a state imperative to increase Russia's market share, and there is high-level involvement in making different arms deals with other countries.",2013,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,Under the influence of arms,,,,,The University of Iowa,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Under the influence of arms: The foreign policy causes and consequences of arms transfers ISBN: 9781303181313 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 10 Volume: 74,,,,,Decision making; International relations; Learned institutions and societies; Political science; Russia; System analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In their aim to take advantage of data many large organizations are launching data management programs. In these attempts organizations recognize that taking full advantage of data requires enterprise wide changes in organizational aspects, business processes, and technology. The lack of recognition of this enterprise-wide scope haunts most data management programs. Research shows that most of these programs fail and get abandoned after long efforts and investments. This study aims to highlight critical reasons why these programs fail and a different approach to address the fundamental problems associated with the majority of these failures. It is important to be successful in the data efforts due to the fact that data driven businesses are gaining significant competitive edge. Data Centric Business Transformation Strategy (DCBT) is a holistic approach for the enterprise to transform into a data driven and agile entity. DCBT is also away to achieve better alignment in the enterprises. DCBT aims to achieve two goals to transform the organization; become a smarter organization by instilling continuous learning and improvement culture in all aspects of the business and achieve agility in enterprise-wide organizational learning and technology. To achieve these two goals, understanding the current state of the organization in the tree fundamental DCBT areas of organizational learning capacity, business processes and technology is essential to incrementally and continuously improve each one in concert. Required improvements should be introduced to smaller parts of the organization delivering the value of data. Strategically chosen pipeline of projects would allow the ramp up of the organization to a continuously learning and changing organization. In the age of digital economy, agile organizations can learn quicker from large amounts of data to have the competitive edge.

DVDQGJ37,thesis,2010,"Lindsey, Johnathan Jake; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Characterizing opportunities for short reach optical interconnect adoption: a market survey and total cost of ownership model approach,,,,,,"Over the past decade, the demand for digital information has increased dramatically with the rising use of the Internet and various types of multimedia data - text, audio, graphics, video, and voice. As a consequence, the technologies that connect and transport data have become critically important. Available interconnect technologies are broadly organized into two categories: electrical and optical. Although many digital systems use electrical interconnects, optical interconnects are becoming an attractive alternative as electrical connection has become increasingly difficult in terms of cost and performance. However, the transition from electrical to optical interconnects across multiple markets could still be hampered by its higher cost relative to interconnects in the mid-term. Thus, this work seeks to shed light on the following question: ""What additional characteristics are useful to evaluate the attractiveness of optical interconnects in emerging markets?"" This thesis seeks to explore and answer this question in three parts. The first part of the thesis attempts to gauge the opportunities and barriers to optical interconnect adoption in emerging markets through an analysis of first phase interviews with professionals working in the datacom, automobile, consumer hand-held device industries. Initial review of the response set shows that of the five initial emerging markets for optical interconnect, datacom, specifically high-performance computing (HPC), has the greatest potential for increased optical interconnect adoption in the near future. To further explore the environment for optical interconnects in the HPC, a second, more detailed questionnaire was distributed to a limited number of interviewees. In response to this interview, some respondents noted that several metrics other than cost and performance, particularly power consumption, as being ""very important"" when deciding which technology to adopt. The second part of the thesis is primarily concerned with investigating further the influence that power and performance concerns have on optical interconnect adoption in HPC data centers. Specifically, this part of the thesis seeks to explore whether power concerns in data centers could lead to increased adoption of optical interconnects. To that end, a cost model of an HPC data center has been developed to identify the possible economic impacts that the adoption of optical interconnect technologies would have in a power-driven scenario. The third part of this thesis presents a set of policy recommendations based on the results from the data center cost model.",2010,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,Characterizing opportunities for short reach optical interconnect adoption,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: Characterizing opportunities for short reach optical interconnect adoption : a market survey and total cost of ownership model approach,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E2CSMRP4,thesis,2014,"Kontsova, Olga",The effects of ageism: Challenges elderly face in nursing homes,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1526502937?pq-origsite=primo,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, by 2030 the older population is expected to be twice as large as it was in 2000, growing from 35 million to 71.5 million (Humes, 2005). Ageism is the unequal treatment of seniors or elderly (65 years and older) based on stereotypical notions that could lead to discriminatory practices. The examination of secondary data from different sources such as U.S. Department of Commerce Economics and Statistics Administration, U.S. Bureau of the Census, statistics of Genworth Financial Inc., the AARP Public Policy Institute's statistics and reports, quantitative reports from nursing homes and online resources of scientific journals and books about the elderly in long term facilities, was used to find out how ageism affects the life of residents in nursing facilities, and what challenges these old people face. The literature demonstrates that ageism is still prevalent and affects the elderly, as an increasingly vulnerable group in our society. Ageism gives a rise to different forms of abuse such as physical, psychological, sexual abuse, financial exploitation or exploitative abuse, and neglect by caregivers toward the seniors in long-term facilities. The examination of the literature shows that retirement planning and long-term institutional care system have to be developed, modernized, and improved to help the increasing number of elderly in their later age. The government should realize the importance of developing, modernizing, and improving the retirement planning and long-term institutional care system to support and help elderly citizens in their later age.",2014,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,The effects of ageism,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: The effects of ageism: Challenges elderly face in nursing homes ISBN: 9781303842122 ISSN: 0898-9095 Issue: 6 Volume: 52,,,,,Ageism; Aging; Nursing homes; Older people; Psychological abuse; Retirement; Sociology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to analyzing historic epidemic data, computational simulation of epidemic propagation processes and disease control strategies can help us understand in the laboratory the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics. Consequently, the public can be better prepared and the government can control future epidemic outbreaks more effectively. Epidemic propagation simulation systems which use high performance computing technology have been proposed and developed to understand disease propagation processes. The proposed systems, however, do not strongly support two important steps in modeling disease propagation: run-time infection situation assessment and intervention adjustment. In addition, while these simulation systems are computationally efficient in their simulations, most of them have limited capabilities in terms of modeling interventions in realistic scenarios. In this dissertation, we focus on building a modeling and simulation environment for epidemic propagation and propagation control strategy. The objective of this work is to design such a modeling environment supporting the previously missing functions while still performing well in terms of the expected features such as modeling fidelity, computational efficiency, modeling capability, etc. Our proposed methodologies to build such a modeling environment are: 1) a loosely coupled and co-evolving model for disease propagation, situation assessment, and propagation control strategy, and 2) using relational databases to assess situations and simulate control strategies. Our motivations are: 1) a loosely coupled and co-evolving model allows us to design modules for each function separately and reduces design complexity for the modeling system, and 2) simulating propagation control strategies using relational databases improves the modeling capability and the human productivity of using this environment. To evaluate our proposed methodologies, we have designed and built a loosely coupled and database supported epidemic modeling and simulation environment. With detailed experimental results and realistic case studies, we demonstrate that our modeling environment provides the missing functions and greatly enhances many expected features, such as modeling capability, without significantly sacrificing computational efficiency and scalability.",2013,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: A Database Supported Modeling Environment for Pandemic Planning and Course of Action Analysis ISBN: 9781303788000,,,,,Computer science; Operations research; Public health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E68Y2A8Q,thesis,2010,"Hamilton, Michael Roberts; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",An analytical framework for long term policy for commercial deployment and innovation in carbon capture and sequestration technology in the United States,,,,,,"Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology has the potential to be a key CO2 emissions mitigation technology for the United States. Several CCS technology options are ready for immediate commercial-scale demonstration, but three obstacles to commercial deployment remain: the lack of a clear legal and regulatory framework for sequestration, the lack of a demonstration phase, and most importantly, the lack of a market for CCS. A successful demonstration phase will achieve the goal of technology readiness. The demonstration phase should be organized so as to share costs and risks between public and private actors. Project selection responsibility should be assigned to a dedicated private board and project management responsibility to private companies. This analysis recommends a combination of the Boucher Bill proposal for a CCS demonstration phase, as incorporated in the American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES Act) of 2009, and a continuation of the DOE Clean Coal Power Initiative program. This combined approach can provide productive competition between public and private demonstration programs. Achieving technology readiness will not on its own lead to commercial deployment of CCS. Two additional policy objectives for the commercial deployment phase are considered: market penetration and cost reduction. Market penetration can be ensured through strong market pull policies, but this may be a very expensive policy approach in the long run. A more prudent goal is long-term cost reduction of CCS. Unlike the market penetration goal, the cost reduction goal will not guarantee that CCS will become a major contributor to carbon emissions mitigation, but it will provide a more cost-effective path. Achieving the cost reduction goal will require strong market pull policies for the short and medium term, together with a focus on technology push policies over the entire period. In the long term, market pull policies for CCS should be eliminated; if CCS is not economically competitive with alternative technologies, it should not be deployed on a significant scale. The ACES Act provides a good policy framework to achieve technology readiness through a demonstration phase and to pursue the long-term goal of cost reduction for commercial deployment of CCS technology. This approach will provide a cost-effective strategy for ensuring that CCS, a major scalable option for carbon emissions mitigation, is given the best chance of success in the long term.",2010,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: An analytical framework for long term policy for commercial deployment and innovation in carbon capture and sequestration technology in the United States,,,,,Carbon sequestration,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E8XGZTCG,thesis,2009,"Mahmoud, Hisham A.",Advanced transceiver algorithms for OFDM(A) systems,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/304996578?pq-origsite=primo,"With the increasing advancements in the digital technology, future wireless systems are promising to support higher data rates, higher mobile speeds, and wider coverage areas, among other features. While further technological developments allow systems to support higher computational complexity, lower power consumption, and employ larger memory units, other resources remain limited. One such resource, which is of great importance to wireless systems, is the available spectrum for radio communications. To be able to support high data rate wireless applications, there is a need for larger bandwidths in the spectrum. Since the spectrum cannot be expanded, studies have been concerned with fully utilizing the available spectrum. One approach to achieve this goal is to reuse the available spectrum through space, time, frequency, and code multiplexing techniques. Another approach is to optimize the transceiver design as to achieve the highest throughput over the used spectrum. From the physical layer perspective, there is a need for a highly flexible and efficient modulation technique to carry the communication signal. A multicarrier modulation technique known as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is one example of such a technique. OFDM has been used in a number of current wireless standards such as wireless fidelity (WiFi) and worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) standards by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and has been proposed for future 4G technologies such as the long term evolution (LTE) and LTE-advanced standards by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and the wireless world initiative new radio (WINNER) standard by the Information society technologies (IST). This is due to OFDM’s high spectral efficiency, resistance to narrow band interference, support for high data rates, adaptivity, and scalability. In this dissertation, OFDM and multiuser OFDM, also known as orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), techniques are investigated as a candidate for advanced wireless systems. Features and requirements of future applications are discussed in detail, and OFDM’s ability to satisfy these requirements is investigated. We identify a number of challenges that when addressed can improve the performance and throughput of OFDM-based systems. The challenges are investigated over three stages. In the first stage, minimizing, or avoiding, the interference between multiple OFDMA users as well as adjacent systems is addressed. An efficient algorithm for OFDMA uplink synchronization that maintains the orthogonality between multiple users is proposed. For adjacent channel interference, a new spectrum shaping method is proposed that can reduce the out-of-band radiation of OFDM signals. Both methods increase the utilization of available spectrum and reduce interference between different users. In the second stage, the goal is to maximize the system throughput for a given available bandwidth. The OFDM system performance is considered under practical channel conditions, and the corresponding bit error rate (BER) expressions are derived. Based on these results, the optimum pilot insertion rate is investigated. In addition, a new pilot pattern that improves the system ability to estimate and equalize various radio frequency (RF) impairments is proposed. In the last stage, acquiring reliable measurements regarding the received signal is addressed. Error vector magnitude (EVM) is a common performance metric that is being used in many of today’s standards and measurement devices. Inferring the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from EVM measurements has been investigated for either high SNR values or data-aided systems. We show that using current methods does not yield reliable estimates of the SNR under other conditions. Thus, we consider the relation between EVM and SNR for nondata-aided systems. We provide expressions that allow for accurate SNR estimation under various practical channel conditions.",2009,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Advanced transceiver algorithms for OFDM(A) systems ISBN: 9781109622034,,,,,Electrical engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I argue that the current scale of social, political, environmental, economic, psychological, and spiritual challenges reflects an underlying “disconnect disorder” (Arabena, 2006), and that these combined external and internal crises present an opportunity for widespread transformative learning and a collective shift. My core hypothesis is that this transition depends on humanity’s ability to engage in a dual process of individual and collective transformation through remembering our connections with ourselves, with one another, with the natural world, and with a sense of purposeful engagement in the world. I investigate this hypothesis through an in-depth, relational study of the Ecology of Leadership program (EOL) at the Regenerative Design Institute (RDI) in Bolinas, California, an organization that aims to “serve as catalyst for a revolution in the way humans relate to the natural world.” The Ecology of Leadership represents a unique model of transformative adult education that incorporates the principles of “inner permaculture” and regenerative design to support participants in cultivating personal and collective transformation. I introduce a “relational” theory and methodological approach, which centralizes Indigenous and ecological principles of relationship, respect, reciprocity, and regeneration. Using interviews (p=20), surveys (p=409), arts-based data (p=12), sharing circles (p=8), and participatory research, I integrate personal and participant narratives together with images, graphics, poems, and practices to bring this case study of the Ecology of Leadership to life. I also advocate for a new model of “regenerative research,” in which the research itself is life-giving and contributes to the healing, transformation, and regeneration of the researcher, the community of research, and the whole system. Based upon my interactions, observations, and interviews in the EOL program and my reflections and supportive research, I conclude by articulating the “Ecology of Transformation,” a holistic model for transformation that incorporates inner and outer change with practices for reconnection to oneself, the natural world, and the village.",2014,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,The ecology of transformation,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: The ecology of transformation: A relational study of the Ecology of Leadership program at the Regenerative Design Institute ISBN: 9781321397161,,,,,Adult education; Astronomy; Educational leadership; Environmental education; Experimental design; Family Relations; Indigenous peoples; Liability (Law); Student newspapers and periodicals; Transformative learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary objective of the JCIDS process is to ensure the capabilities required by the joint warfighter are identified, assessed, validated, and prioritized in a transparent process that allows for a balanced and informed decision. Although JCIDS continues to evolve, criticisms remain: solution development and delivery are not timely; the process is complex; and it lacks mechanisms to focus the review across portfolios; to name a few. It is imperative to address these fundamental issues as the DoD is now forced to operate within a severely constrained fiscal environment - the DoD must gain better insight and visibility across its defense requirements portfolio. This thesis seeks to address these issues through the application of Systems Engineering techniques, specifically an Enterprise Strategic Analysis and Semantic Architecture review, to the JCIDS process. The Enterprise Strategic Analysis reveals the critical stakeholder interactions as well as nuances of the landscape in which JCIDS functions. This is followed by a detailed Semantic Architecture review of sample documents within the JCIDS process to inform a knowledge base.

EA4JGPMK,thesis,2017,"Gingerich, Daniel Beryl",Evaluating and Avoiding Risk Tradeoffs in Water Treatment,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Evaluating_and_Avoiding_Risk_Tradeoffs_in_Water_Treatment/6716468/1,"Treating water in order to reduce human and environmental risks requires the use of electricity and chemicals, the generation of which creates emissions of air pollutants such as NOx, SO2, PM2.5, and CO2. Emissions of air pollutants establishes a health and environmental risk tradeoff between air and water pollution. Addressing air-water tradeoffs by adopting a one environment framework requires new methods for quantifying these tradeoffs, new technologies to minimize air-water tradeoffs, and new tools for decision makers to incorporate these tradeoffs into compliance decisions. In my thesis, I develop methods for quantifying damages from air emissions associated with water treatment; assess the feasibility of forward osmosis (FO), a technology which holds the promise to avoid air-water tradeoffs; and create a tool to holistically assess compliance with air and water emission standards for coal-fired power plants (CFPPs). I start my thesis by creating a method to quantify the damages caused by the air emissions that resulting from the treatment of drinking water (Chapter 2), municipal wastewater (Chapter 3), and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater (Chapter 4). These studies use life-cycle models of energy and chemical consumption for individual water treatment unit processes in order to estimate embedded emissions of criteria air pollutants and greenhouse gasses per cubic meter of treated water. Damages from these additional air emissions are assessed and incorporated into benefit-cost analyses. I find that for drinking water rules, the net benefit of currently implemented rules remains positive but the promises of net benefits for some proposed rules are conditional on the compliance technology that is selected. For municipal wastewater, I find that while there are ~$240 million (in 2012 USD) benefits in air emission reduction from installing biogas-fueled electricity generation nationwide, there are several states where biogas-fueled electricity creates more air emissions than it displaces. For FGD wastewater treatment, I find that complying with the effluent limitation guidelines has an expected ratio of benefits to cost of1.7-1.8, with damages concentrated in regions with large chemical manufacturing industries or electricity grids that are heavily reliant on coal. In the next part of the thesis, I assess the techno-economic feasibility of power plant waste heat driven FO to reduce the air emissions associated with FGD wastewater treatment. In Chapter 5, I assess the quantity, quality and the spatial and temporal availability of waste heat from US coal, nuclear, and natural gas power plants. I find that while 18.9 billion GJ of potentially recoverable waste heat is discharged into the environment, only 900 million GJ of that heat is from the flue gas and is at a temperature high enough to drive water purification using forward osmosis (FO). In Chapter 6, I build a model of FO to assess its thermal energy consumption and find that the 900 million GJ of waste heat produced at coal and natural gas power plants is sufficient to meet their boiler feedwater and FGD wastewater treatment needs. In Chapter 7, I incorporate cost into the energy consumption model of FO, and conclude that treatment of FGD and gasification wastewater using waste heat driven FO is economically competitive with mechanical vapor recompression. In Chapter 8, I create an energy-balance model of a CFPP and nine environmental control technologies for compliance with FGD wastewater and carbon capture regulations. I use this model to maximize plant revenue at the National Energy Technology Laboratory’s 550 MW model CFPP without carbon capture. I find that revenue is maximized by using residual heat for water treatment or carbon capture. If both carbon capture and zero liquid discharge water treatment regulatory standards are in place, I conclude that the plant maximizes revenue by allocating residual heat and steam to amine-based carbon capture and electricity to mechanical vapor recompression for FGD wastewater treatment.",8/1/17,5/20/25 17:33,5/20/25 17:33,5/20/25 17:33,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716468.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/XH7F6NM7/Gingerich - 2017 - Evaluating and Avoiding Risk Tradeoffs in Water Treatment.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EARS2CHZ,thesis,2013,"Donner, Christopher M.",Examining the link between self-control and misconduct in a multi-agency sample of police supervisors: A test of two theories,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1351364763?pq-origsite=primo,"As police personnel carry out their mandates of enforcing the law, maintaining order, and serving the public, they are entrusted to ""practice what they preach."" They are expected to abide by the rules, laws, and ethical principles that apply to them as they hold private citizens to account for violations of laws. When the police do not live up to this standard by committing police misconduct, it can tarnish not just the individual officer, but the department and jurisdiction as well. Police misconduct is a concern for society as police misbehavior can result in negative outcomes, such as distrust by the citizenry, poor police-community relations, and litigation. Therefore, it is important for academics and police administrators to gain a better understanding of why police personnel engage in occupational deviance. A sizable literature has identified several individual, organizational, and community-level correlates of police misconduct, but there is a general dearth of knowledge concerning criminological explanations for police misconduct. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential relationship between self-control and police misconduct utilizing two versions of self-control theory. The primary objectives of the dissertation were to: (1) investigate whether self-control predicts police misconduct; and, if so, (2) identify which version of self-control theory best explains police misconduct. The original version of self-control theory (Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990) hypothesizes that crime and deviant behavior are the result of low self-control, which is characterized by impulsivity, a preference for simple tasks, a proclivity for risk-seeking activities, self-centeredness, and a quick temper. More than a decade later, Hirschi (2004) revised the theory in an effort to address several shortcomings of the original theoretical model. In this revision, he moved the focus away from the personality trait of self-control to a rational choice, decision-making conceptualization, which he argued is more consistent with the original intent of the theory. From this new perspective, self-control refers to an internal set of inhibitors that influence the choices people make. Data were collected through online surveys of 101 police supervisors within three U.S. police agencies. The respondents are part of a larger research project, known as the National Police Research Platform, which is funded by the National Institute of Justice. The data were analyzed using a series of correlational and multiple regression strategies. Based on theory and prior research, it was hypothesized that measures of both theoretical versions would significantly predict police misconduct and that, in a full regression model, both versions would yield significant (and independent) effects. As predicted by the hypotheses, the results demonstrated that low self-control (as a measure of Gottfredson and Hirschi's theoretical version) and revised self-control (as a measure of Hirschi's revised theoretical version) were both significantly related to past police misconduct and the likelihood of future police misconduct. Furthermore, both measures produced independent effects in full regression models. Lastly, as evinced by standardized regression coefficients, the results suggested that revised self-control is the superior theoretical version within the context of police deviance. The finding that self-control is related to police misconduct has important policy implications for police administrators. Specifically, it is recommended that administrators 1) bolster their personnel selection and hiring through the use of more judicious background investigations and increased use of psychological testing; 2) increase the use of integrity-testing strategies, such as early warning systems, to detect problematic employees; and 3) utilize quality police training programs with emphases on ethics, consequences of misbehavior, and mechanisms to strengthen employees' levels of self-control. Study strengths and limitations, as well as directions for future research, are presented.",2013,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,Examining the link between self-control and misconduct in a multi-agency sample of police supervisors,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Examining the link between self-control and misconduct in a multi-agency sample of police supervisors: A test of two theories ISBN: 9781303030567 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 8 Volume: 74,,,,,Criminology; Deviant behavior; Executives; Law; Police; Professional Misconduct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis is motivated by a desire to determine if convincing evidence exists that the lack of diplomats' technical knowledge and/or existing relational difficulties between the diplomat and the technical expert have negative effects on international agreements. The first required step, the focus of this thesis, is to gain an understanding of the technical expert and the diplomat's relationship. This thesis has examined, as a case study, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Office of External Relations' (OER) diplomats - officially known as international program specialists (IPS). The IPSs were interviewed and the data was analyzed using the grounded theory coding process. Statistics and charts were produced from pre-interview questionnaires and competency data and used as supporting evidence for the interview data. The thesis question is expressed and answered through its three sub-questions: What is the IPS's working relationship with scientists and engineers? How do IPSs go about writing the technical content of agreements? What is the IPS' technical competence? The collective answer is that an IPS does not generate the technical content of agreements, but relies heavily on the technical expert for both the content and its clarification. This lack of technical competence is supported by the fact that only 1% of reported OER's employees' competencies are technical (hard math and science) and only 4% are technically related. Additionally, hypotheses were drawn: An evaluation of the current IPS orientation process and OER training procedures may show that, despite perceived difficulties, the practices are the best available; An increased understanding of the IPS's role, on behalf of the technical experts - especially the field experts, should improve the relationship between the IPS and the technical expert; The technical competence of an IPS is, to some degree, dependent on both (1) the working relationship an IPS has with the technical expert and (2) the IPS' capability, capacity, and desire to learn. The study largely implies that the lack of understanding of the diplomat's role may also be apparent in other technical organizations where the method of diplomacy aiding science and technology is practiced.",2010,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,A case study in science and technology diplomacy,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: A case study in science and technology diplomacy : understanding diplomats' technical competency and interaction with technical experts,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To overcome those challenge, healthcare organizations have employed many of the common Quality Improvement Methodologies (QIMs). Those methodologies and others have been some of the most effective tools for quality improvement in many other industries, including manufacturing and supply chain. However, it is unclear as to how QIMs are utilized in healthcare settings and if the QIM implementations can benefit from the commonly implemented Health Information Technologies (HITs). This study evaluates the hypothesis of whether or not QIMs are implemented using HIT systems in hospitals and practices in the United States. This involves evaluating the types of implemented QIMs as well as investigating the outcomes of the employed methodologies in terms of efficiency, throughput and financial impact. Moreover, the study forms an understanding on how the different HITs that exist in many healthcare settings are used as part of QIMs. The study also assesses the obstacles that prevent hospitals and practices from utilizing HITs in QIMs. To conduct the study, two datasets have been obtained, which are the Dorenfest Institute dataset and the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics data source.

EQHKBZGH,thesis,2020,"Fingerhut, Henry Alan; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Individual and organizational Uses of Evidence-Based Practice in healthcare settings,,,,,,"In the three decades since its introduction, Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) has become standard clinical practice and the subject of targeted interventions at all levels of the health system. Despite its prevalence, EBP is frequently challenged on philosophical, practical, empirical, and normative grounds. And EBP is often underused in practice relative to the considerable investment in training and sophisticated organizational interventions to implement EBP. In this dissertation, I identify what the concept of EBP means to health system stakeholders as a partial explanation for this persistent gap in EBP use and implementation outcomes. Through interviews with clinicians and healthcare administrators, I identify how providers and organizations use EBP in practice to clinical ends and in inter-professional relationships. First, I find that in contrast to the theoretical model, stakeholders vary in how they operationalize EBP for individual-level clinical use. Stakeholders endorse a range of what I call implicit mental models of EBP that imply different approaches to clinical decision-making. Respondents' implicit mental models of EBP each emphasize an incomplete aspect of the full EBP model: Resource-Based EBP emphasizes specific evidence artifacts, Decision-Making EBP emphasizes the decision-making process, and EBT-Based EBP emphasizes specific Evidence-Based Treatments. These implicit models represent the decision inputs, process, and outputs, respectively. Second, I describe how and why healthcare organizations conduct EBP interventions, despite its initial design as an individual-level clinical decision-making model. I document a range of different organizational EBP activities and interventions, including disseminating resources, training providers, and implementing local standards. These organizational EBP activities both support individual EBP use and address broader organizational ends, which may conflict. Finally, EBP takes on social and inter-professional meanings beyond its intended scope as a clinical decision-making model, which emerge in context and affect how providers understand and use EBP. Specifically, providers may renounce their standing to evaluate evidence, demonstratively use EBP, and administrators claim standing to evaluate evidence. This dissertation therefore demonstrates the varied uses of EBP that emerge in practice, contributing to our understanding of the challenges and contradictions that arise in applying general knowledge to individual cases and systematizing strategies for the same at the organization level.",2020,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2020 Ph.D.,Book Title: Individual and organizational Uses of Evidence-Based Practice in healthcare settings,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technical decision aid can provide a framework for informed decision making, allowing individuals to better understand the tradeoff between resources, technology, energy services, and prices. While technical decision aid have made significant advances in evaluating these quantitative aspects of energy planning and performance, they have not been designed to incorporate human factors, such as preferences and behavior that are informed by cultural values. Incorporating cultural values into decision tools can provide not only an improved decision framework for the Navajo Nation, but also generate new insights on how these perspective can improve decision making on energy resources. Ensuring these aids are a cultural fit for each context has the potential to increase trust and promote understanding of the tradeoffs involved in energy resource management. In this dissertation I present the development of a technical tool that explicitly addresses cultural and spiritual values and experimentally assesses their influence on the preferences and decision making of Navajo citizens. Chapter 2 describes the results of a public elicitation effort to gather information about stakeholder views and concerns related to energy development in the Navajo Nation in order to develop a larger sample survey and a decision-support tool that links techno-economic energy models with sociocultural attributes. Chapter 3 details the methods of developing the energy decision aid and its underlying assumptions for alternative energy projects and their impacts. This tool also provides an alternative to economic valuation of cultural impacts based upon an ordinal index tied to environmental impacts. Chapter 4 details the the influence of various cultural, environmental, and economic outcome information provided through the developed decision aid on beliefs and preferences related to the type and scale of energy development, trust of decision makers, and larger concern for environmental protection. Finally, chapter 5 presents concluding thoughts future research and on how technical-social decision tools can provide a means ensuring effective decision making on the Navajo Nation and other American Indian communities.",8/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715895.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERZ9JJAJ,thesis,2018,"Das, Lita; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Backroom space allocation in retail stores,,,,,,"Space is one of the most scarce, expensive, and difficult to manage resources in urban retail establishments. A typical retail space broadly consists of two areas, the customer facing frontroom area and the backroom area, which is used for inventory storage and other support activities. While frontrooms have received considerable amount of attention from both academics and practitioners, backrooms are an often neglected area of retail space management and design. However, the allocation of space to the backroom and its management impact multiple operational aspects of retail establishments. These include in-store labor utilization, delivery schedules, product packaging, and inventory management. Therefore, the backroom area directly affects the performance of the store because it impacts stock-outs, customer service levels, and labor productivity. Moreover, extant literature suggests that backroom related operations contribute to a large fraction of the total retail supply chain costs. Thus, optimizing the management of backroom spaces is an important lever for store performance improvement. We address the gap in the extant literature related to space management of retail backrooms by investigating the following three questions: First, what is the effect of pack size on inventory levels and space needs in the backroom? Second, how can a given backroom space be efficiently utilized through optimal inventory control? Third, what is the optimal amount of space that should be allocated to the backroom in a given retail establishment? To address the first question, we evaluate the effect of two discrete pack sizes, order pack size (OPS) and storable pack size (SPS), on inventory levels and storage space requirements in the backrooms. While SPS drives the space needs for a given inventory level, OPS drives the amount of excess inventory and therefore, the space needs. Using inventory theory and probability theory, we quantify the amount of excess inventory and the expected stock-out probability for a given OPS in the case of a normally distributed demand. To address the second question, we discuss an inventory-theoretic approach to efficiently manage a given backroom space within a limited service restaurant. Specifically, we formulate a mathematical optimization model using mixed-integer linear programing with the objective of maximizing store profit. Applying this optimization model to real store data in collaboration with a major US retailer reveals cost implications related to constrained backroom space and the sensitivity of backroom space requirements to changes in OPS and SPS. The proposed model can serve as a decision support tool for various real-world use cases. For instance, the tool can help the retailers to identify (i) items whose contribution to the store profit does not justify their space needs in the backroom, and (ii) stores that are constrained in their profitability growth by backroom space limitations. To address the third question, we introduce the notion of interdependency between the frontroom and the backroom of a retail establishment. Such interdependencies yield nontrivial trade-offs inherent to the optimal retail space allocation. Demand can be lost due to unavailability of inventory (or inventory stock-out), which is a result of scarce amount of backroom space, or due to unavailability of sufficient frontroom space (or space stock-out). Furthermore, constrained backroom spaces increase in-store labor cost and the ordering costs incurred per unit of revenue generated in a retail establishment. The strategic decision model formulated in this chapter accounts for revenue, inventory cost, labor cost and ordering cost to determine the optimal amount of backroom space that should be allocated within a retail establishment. Sensitivity analyses with respect to the change in input parameters is used to connect the backroom space allocation and its impact on store profit to the different supply chain levers that can be managed by the retailers.",2018,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2018 Ph.D.,Book Title: Backroom space allocation in retail stores,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVA3UHTR,thesis,2019,"Ogbo, Erezi","Impact of Over-the-top Services, Pricing, and Equity on the Digital Divides in Sub-Saharan Africa",,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Impact_of_Over-the-top_Services_Pricing_and_Equity_on_the_Digital_Divides_in_Sub-Saharan_Africa/9964220/1,"With the convergence within the digital ecosystem today, access to digital technology is now a multilevel phenomenon closely tied to the access to one or more of the following: a compatible device, the Internet, and a facilitating service/application. This makes it difficult to disentanglemobile services and Internet services in studies on the digital divide. As countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which have the lowest adoption rates globally, look to leverage digital technologies as a tool to drive economic and social development, there is a need for continued and novel approaches to understanding the digital divide. This thesis proposes a new approach to conceptualizing the digital divide and characterizes the three levels of the digital divide:inequalities in access, use, and benefits from use in SSA, using Nigeria as a case study. This work also critically examines the effect of recent pricing policies in Nigeria on the digital divide, as well as the effect of other sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors at the individual level. In Chapter 2, I run a choice-based conjoint experiment to understand the impact of access toover-the-top (OTT) services on individual preferences for different mobile services – cellular calls, text, or the different services on the Internet – or not using any mobile service (the first level digital divide). I find that when OTTs are introduced into the market, mobile users are lesslikely to go without mobile services or to use a traditional service. I also find that this effect is significant in a market with a pay-as-you-go business model. The results also reveal that mobile users are price sensitive, therefore pricing policies may aid in bridging the first and second levelsof the digital divide. The findings indicate that customers’ preferences in the mobile market are changing and OTT access could be a tool in closing the first-level digital divide. Therefore, I recommend that policies to drive Internet access, especially OTT, should be explored. In Chapter 3, I use a panel data approach to estimate the effect of reduction in the prices of mobile Internet plans on the volume of use of the Internet, cellular calls, and text messaging services (the second-level digital divide). I find that the reduction in the prices is associated with an increase in the volume of data used and a decrease in the volume of texts sent by an individual. However, reducing the prices of mobile Internet plans does not “close” the second level digital divide across socioeconomic groups. I did not see a convergence in the volume of use of any of the mobile services across any demographic subgroups. These findings suggest that more robust policies that are targeted at specific subgroups are needed to reduce the existingsecond-level mobile technology digital divide that exists in developing countries. In Chapter 4, I draw on the Uses and Gratifications Theory, the Unified Theory of Acceptanceand Use of Technology, and factor analysis to examine the differences in the frequency and type of Internet use (second-level digital divide) and the differences in outcomes from Internet use (third-level digital divide). I find that females, the older population, and individuals with a lowerlevel of education are the digitally disadvantaged subset of the population. I also find that high technical skills are associated with high frequency of use of the Internet for personal development, social, and business activities. I also find that encouragement from family and friends as well as intention to increase Internet use in the future are associated with increased frequency of use of the Internet for consuming news content and social interaction respectively. This supports arguments in an earlier work that improving access to over-the-top applications such as WhatsApp could increase Internet use. In examining the determinants of the third-level digital divide, I find that using the Internet for social activities such as using social networks and communicating with family and friends have the greatest impact on offline outcomes. I also findthat individuals with a high level of education are more likely to get positive health outcomes and less likely to get personal development outcomes, such as getting a job or completing an online training, from the Internet.In Chapter 5, I discuss this work’s contribution to the literature and some of the policy implications of the findings in Chapters 2 through 4. Findings in Chapters 2 through 4 suggest that supporting the use of OTT and social networks in developing countries would have benefits. These Internet activities, although they may not directly contribute to personal development or economic gains, typically require little technical skills. Therefore, by engaging with theseInternet activities, the digitally disadvantaged subset of the population would be able to develop the required skills to achieve benefits from Internet use. In Chapter 3, I learn that addressing the affordability barrier in a developing country is not enough to bridge the second-level digital divide. More robust policies are needed to bridge the second-level digital divide in developing countries. In Chapter 4, I learn that the digital disadvantage may simply be a reflection ofsocietal inequalities in the online space. Therefore, in order to bridge the digital divide, target policies that address these preexisting inequalities are recommended.",10/18/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:35,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/9964220.v1,,"/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/NCWTZ7W2/Ogbo - 2019 - Impact of Over-the-top Services, Pricing, and Equity on the Digital Divides in Sub-Saharan Africa.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EX8GSMMI,thesis,2022,"Cochrane, Jared; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Simulating an optical neural network for deep learning in edge computing,,,,,,"Deep learning has risen to prominence in fields from medicine to autonomous vehicles. This rise has been driven by improvements in parallel computing from graphics processing units (GPUs) as well as large data sets. Applying deep learning to edge computing is challenging because deep neural network (DNN) hardware must not only possess the needed computational power but must also satisfy size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints for practical deployment. Many DNNs require a GPU or data center to run, both of which are too large to fit onto edge devices. Here, an optical neural network (ONN) accelerator called netcast is simulated on two real-world machine vision applications: MNIST digit classification and scene recognition. The netcast ONN enables large DNNs to run on SWaP-limited edge devices with significantly less energy needed to run inference compared to digital models. Software simulations are used to assess netcast's performance on MNIST classification and scene recognition relative to digital networks. Using an accuracy per energy consumption figure of merit (FOM), the simulations indicate that netcast is able to outperform digital electronics on average by over three orders of magnitude. Netcast's strong performance relative to its digital counterparts indicates that it will enable the novel deployment of large DNNs to edge applications in a way that would be infeasible using current digital electronics. Netcast's novel applications give rise to a host of policy challenges, one of which focuses on defining and applying acceptable performance metrics to optically enabled deep learning.",2022,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Simulating an optical neural network for deep learning in edge computing,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

F6UP7LN8,thesis,2016,"Doi, Tatsuya; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",Interaction of lifecycle properties in High Speed Rail systems operation,,,,,,"High-Speed Rail (HSR) has been expanding throughout the world, providing various nations with alternative solutions for the infrastructure design of intercity passenger travel. HSR is a capital-intensive infrastructure, in which multiple subsystems are closely integrated. Also, HSR operation lasts for a long period, and its performance indicators are continuously altered by incremental updates. With this background, design and monitoring of lifecycle properties, or ""ilities"", is an important factor to achieve long-term successful operation. This thesis aims to analyze and evaluate dynamic behaviors of ""ilities"" and their interactions in HSR operation. After the literature review and the study of industrial trends about HSR ""ilities"", safety, availability and profitability are chosen as key ""ilities"" which should be monitored in HSR operation. The Tokaido Shinkansen in Japan, and Amtrak's service in the US Northeast Corridor (NEC) are chosen as cases to study ""ilities"" trends. In the Tokaido Shinkansen, three ""ilities"" form a positive feedback loop to make HSR operation successful. The NEC shows high profitability, but it does not perform as well in terms of safety and availability due to several systemic factors. System Dynamics (SD) is applied to visualize interactions of ""ilities"" and other variables of interest. Qualitative causal loop diagrams (CLD) reveal several feedback loops affecting ""ilities"". In particular, the integration of train operation and infrastructure / rolling stock management results in the emergence of major feedback loops which cannot easily be captured by other methodologies. Qualitative SD models are converted into quantitative SD models, and numerical simulations are run to further understand the structure of causal loop diagrams. Estimated parameters in the Tokaido and the NEC suggest the different relationships among ""ilities"" and other variables. Further, sensitivity analyses are conducted to evaluate how different policies affect ""ilities"" in future HSR operations.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Interaction of lifecycle properties in High Speed Rail systems operation,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
F7HJFMGL,thesis,2015,"Stein, Beth R.",Applications of Imaging Spectroscopy in Forest Ecosystems at Multiple Scales,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1946183023?pq-origsite=primo,"Forests provide a number of ecosystem services which sustain and enrich the wildlife, human societies, and the environment. However, many disturbances threaten forest ecosystems, making it necessary to monitor their health for optimal management and conservation. Although there are many indicators of forest health, changes in biogeochemical cycling, loss of species diversity, and invasive plants are particularly useful due to their vulnerability to the effects of climate change and intensive agricultural land use. Thus, this work evaluates the use of imaging spectroscopy to monitor forest nutrient status, species diversity, and plant invasions in the Mid-Atlantic region. The research is divided into four separate studies, each of which evaluated a unique application for imaging spectroscopy data at a different scale within the forest. The first two studies examined loblolly pine nutrient status at the leaf and canopy scales, respectively. The first study determined that loblolly pine foliar macronutrient concentrations can be successfully modeled across the Southeastern US (R2=0.39-0.74). Following on these results, the second study focused on the relationship between physical characteristics, reflectance, and nutrients. Reflectance values and W scattering coefficients produced successful nitrogen models across loblolly pine plots at the canopy scale. Regression models showed similar explanatory power for nitrogen, although W scattering coefficients were significantly correlated with nitrogen at multiple wavelengths and reflectance variables were not. However, the direction of some of the correlations with W and the unusually high directional area scattering factor values indicate a need for further experimentation. The third study found that several imaging spectroscopy algorithms were moderately successful in identifying wavyleaf basketgrass invasions in mixed deciduous forests (overall accuracy=0.35-0.78; kappa=0.41-0.53). Lastly, the fourth study used a novel imaging spectroscopy/lidar fusion to identify canopy gaps and measure species diversity of understory vegetation. The lidar algorithm identified 29 of 34 canopy gaps, and regression models explained 49 percent of the variance in gap species diversity. In conclusion, imaging spectroscopy can be used to evaluate ecosystem health through forest nutrient status, nitrogen models, species diversity estimates, and identification of invasive plant species.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Applications of Imaging Spectroscopy in Forest Ecosystems at Multiple Scales ISBN: 9780355211146,,,,,Remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A landslide inventory database from Switzerland is used to perform two types of analysis. The first presents a proof of concept for an analogue method of detecting the frequency in landslide activity with future climate change conditions. Instead of relying on modeled precipitation, it uses composites of atmospheric variables to identity the conditions that are associated with days on which a landslide occurred. The analogues are compared to relevant meteorological variables in MERRA reanalysis data to achieve a success rate of over 50% in matching observed landslide days within 7 days. The second analysis explores the effectiveness of machine learning as a technique to evaluate the likelihood of a slide to create high damage. The algorithm is tuned to accommodate unbalanced data, extraneous variables, and variance in voting to achieve the best predictive success. This method provides an efficient way of calculating vulnerability and identifying the spatial and temporal factors which influence it. The results are able to identify high damage landslides with a success of upwards of 70%.

FAAQLEUG,thesis,2016,"Gao, Fei; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",Modeling human attention and performance in automated environments with low task loading,,,,,,"Automation has the benefit of reducing human operators' workload. By leveraging the power of computers and information technology, the work of human operators is becoming easier. However, when the workload is too low but the human is required to be present either by regulation or due to limitations of automation, human performance can be negatively affected. Negative consequences such as distraction, mind wandering, and inattention have been reported across many high risk settings including unmanned aerial vehicle operation, process control plant supervision, train engineers, and anesthesiologists. Because of the move towards more automated systems in the future, a better understanding is needed to enable intervention and mitigation of possible negative impacts. The objectives of this research are to systematically investigate the attention and performance of human operators when they interact with automated systems under low task load, build a dynamic model and use it to facilitate system design. A systems-based framework, called the Boredom Influence Diagram, was proposed to better understand the relationships between the various influences and outcomes of low task loading. A System Dynamics model, named the Performance and Attention with Low-task-loading (PAL) Model, was built based on this framework. The PAL model captures the dynamic changes of task load, attention, and performance over time in long duration low task loading automated environments. In order to evaluate the replication and prediction capability of the model, three dynamic hypotheses were proposed and tested using data from three experiments. The first hypothesis stated that attention decreases under low task load. This was supported by comparing model outputs with data from an experiment of target searching using unmanned vehicles. Building on Hypothesis 1, the second and third hypotheses examined the impact of decreased attention on performance in responding to an emergency event. Hypothesis 2 was examined by comparing model outputs with data from an experiment of accident response in nuclear power plant monitoring. Results showed that performance is worse with lower attention levels. Hypothesis 3 was tested by comparing model outputs with data from an experiment of defensive target tracking. The results showed that the impact of decreased attention on performance was larger when the task was difficult. The process of testing these three hypotheses shows that the PAL model is a generalized theory that could explain behaviors under low task load in different supervisory control settings. Finally, benefits, limitations, generalizability and applications of the PAL model were evaluated. Further research is needed to improve and extend the PAL model, investigate individual differences to facilitate personnel selection, and develop system and task designs to mitigate negative consequences.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 Ph.D.,Book Title: Modeling human attention and performance in automated environments with low task loading,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FAM6J779,thesis,2016,"Chikasha, Jubilee",Linguistic Revitalisation: Tonga in Zimbabwe,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2568201661?pq-origsite=primo,"Multilingualism is a reality in most African countries. It is also a reality that most African countries, if not all have once been under colonial dominance with colonial languages adding on to the language ecologies of the said countries. With the dawn of independence in the 20th century, most African countries inherited colonial language policies, which were characterised by the hegemony of the colonial languages and followed the top-down language planning approach. Zimbabwe, the country under study, boasts of 16 languages in its linguistic ecology but inherited English as the High (H) language in relation to indigenous Zimbabwean languages. In terms of local languages, the approach to language planning has been fashioned along monolingualism as a way of perpetuating the ideology of national unity, an ideology, which is not shared by the majority of ethnic groups in Zimbabwe. This ideology divided Zimbabwe into two linguistic blocks dominated by Shona and Ndebele languages. This led to the further denigration of other languages, particularly the so-called minority languages whose existence has been ignored for a long time. Under this premise, there is need for a change in the language planning approach from top-down to bottom-up if minority languages are to survive into the future. This approach has been used by the Tonga speakers and has successfully resulted in the revitalisation of their language. The study therefore examines the motivations for the revitalisation of Tonga, the factors that have led to the Tonga success story, as well as the extent of Tonga development. Data for the research was gathered through interviews, questionnaires and material culture. The research site was Binga District in North-western Zimbabwe. Social actors who were, and are still, involved in the revitalisation of Tonga were used as informants. These included Binga District chiefs, parents, teachers, learners, non-governmental organisations, churches and educational institutions. A multi-dimensional approach was adopted in the analysis and evaluation of the data gathered for the research. This includes Fishman’s (1991) Reversing Language Shift, UNESCO’S (2003) Nine Factors and Milligan’s (2010) Systems Model of Language Planning, The revitalisation of Tonga was driven by various motivational factors, which range from the linguistic, economic to the political. The Tonga people believed that the death of Tonga language would be synonymous with the death of Tonga as a people. Revitalising their language was therefore a way of sustaining their identity. They also wanted to revitalise their language as a way of creating space for themselves within the boundaries of Zimbabwean citizenry. The currency that the Tonga people believed to be associated with their language also motivated them to develop their language. The research has shown that the Tonga success story is attributed to a number of factors. At the heart of the success story is the Tonga people’s unwavering love, pride, loyalty and commitment to the revitalisation of their language. This positive attitude was a great source of strength in times of challenges, failures and discouragements. The Tonga people augmented their positive attitude with collaborations with other social actors like non-governmental organisations (Silveira House, Save The Children Fund-UK, Catholic Commission for Justice for PeaceBinga), educational institutions (University of Zimbabwe: African Languages Department, African Languages Research Institute), publishing houses as well as people in their individual capacities. The collaborations brought in the expertise and resources that the Tonga people lacked. The Tonga success story is a story worth telling particularly for the reason that it is a result of bottom-up initiatives. It is hoped that the implementation of the various dynamics of the bottom-up approach used by Tonga speakers may also help resuscitate other minority languages from their linguistic deathbeds.",2016,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,Linguistic Revitalisation,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Linguistic Revitalisation: Tonga in Zimbabwe ISBN: 9798738671920,,,,,Ability; African languages; Apartheid; Attitudes; Biology; Citizenship; Culture; Data Analysis; Ecology; Education; Government; Historical linguistics; Language; Language acquisition; Language planning; Language policy; Linguistics; Literacy; Material culture; Planning; Political planning; Political science; Public policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Benefits of distributed CHP technologies arise from their direct connection to distribution and customer facilities, which can potentially alleviate transmission and distribution network constraints, lower network energy losses, improve system reliability, and result in CO2 emissions reductions and overall capital cost. This thesis focuses on understanding the technological, social and economic attractiveness of CHP technologies under different tariff designs, market conditions and incentives. It not only looks at the optimum economic value of CHP to individual customers, but also impacts on the system peak load and the environment. For that purpose, the thesis develops a methodology that focuses on analyzing customers' reactions to various exogenous parameters by looking at their CHP installation and operation decisions. Moreover, it adopts an overarching framework that integrates and streamlines the processes from simulation of customers' energy loads, representation of regulatory and market conditions, to the generation and interpretation of the installation and operations decisions. Results suggest that many distributed CHP technologies could bring positive economic value to the customers even without considering incentives. In the meanwhile, metrics like CO2 emissions, overall efficiency and system peak reduction all improved with the introduction of NGDCHPs. These observations confirm that NGDCHP systems have the potential to reduce costs at both the individual customers' level and at the system level. Moreover, we find that customers' decisions are noticeably influenced by the tariffication and incentive methods. Volumetric-only tariffs suffer from potential cross-subsidization and insufficient remuneration for network companies, but encourage higher utilization rate and installations because of the higher variable electricity price. In comparison, breaking down the electricity prices based on different cost drivers could send the correct economic signals to the customers while still meeting the sustainability principle for tariff designs. Additionally, we find that changing market conditions can have significant effects on the economic value of CHP systems installed on-site, and the annual savings are most sensitive to electricity purchase prices. In conclusion, the goal of this research is to explore the value of gas fired distributed CHP systems under different settings. It informs the private sector as well as the policymakers by how to realize the potential benefits of distributed CHP systems. In the future, the methodology and framework developed in this thesis could be further applied to analyze scenarios where distributed CHP penetration is high and is coupled with other distributed energy resources.",2015,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Analysis on the impacts of electricity tariffs on the attractiveness of gas fired distributed combined heat and power systems,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just like safety of food and water, the security of personal information should be pay attention by every person in case of malicious intention. The personal data information can be used to help medical institute and network company to optimize their research result and industrial structure. However, some sensitive personal data cannot be shared due to the human factors of untrusted parities. In this dissertation, I study privacy issues in data mining and provide a reputation system for wireless network with untrusted parities. Data mining with recent technical advances has become more important in Big Data Era. However, as the data continuously growing, people will care their privacy increasing more. So how to protect the privacy is the most important part when the data involving people's sensitive information such as genome sequence. The challenge in privacy-preserving data mining is avoiding the invasion of personal data privacy. Secure computation provides a solution to this problem. In this thesis, first I present a privacy-preserving method for training Restricted Boltzmann Machine. The method guarantees the privacy-protection in semi-honest model. Second, I design and analyze a symmetric-key based privacy-preserving scheme for mining support counts. Third, to protect data privacy in clustering, I study the method of privacy-preserving clustering using representatives over arbitrarily partitioned data. Fourth, I introduce Scorpio, a simple and convenient add-in for privacy preserving logrank test. Finally, I propose a incentive consideration to the study of secure computation by presenting a reputation system in wireless network. The system can provide an incentive for the misbehaving nodes to behave honestly. Experiments have shown that our reputation system is very efficient in detecting misbehaving nodes and increasing average throughput in the whole network.",2013,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Privacy-preserving and reputation system in distributed computing with untrusted parties ISBN: 9781303474682,,,,,Computer science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FDZQZ4AX,thesis,2015,"Yao, Jingling",Core competencies for the twenty-first century university education: An investigation into students' perceptions in two Chinese societies,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1734877049?pq-origsite=primo,"The rapid expansion of university education in China brings unprecedented challenges for preparing a huge graduate population in the ever-changing society of the twenty-first century. In order to prepare university students with competencies for the twenty-first century, a holistic and deep understanding of the development of students’ competencies in university education is imperative to enable more appropriate and effective university education. This study aimed to explore university students’ perceptions on core competencies for the twenty-first century, including their perceptions on the importance of the core competencies, the self-assessment of owning the core competencies, and the perceived adequacy of university education in preparing them with core competencies. A mixed methods research design was adopted with both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The quantitative design was the dominant method used, in which a cross-sectional survey using a self-report questionnaire of 40 Likert-type items was used to collect data from 5,042 university students from Macau and Zhejiang Province in China. Since these two locations are under the different education system and Higher Education Act (Macau is a Special Administrative Region in China), this study called them as ‘two Chinese societies’. The questionnaire comprised three subscales, namely, Importance, Possession, and Adequacy. The qualitative approach was purposively set as supplements to the quantitative results, in which four focus-group interviews with university students and eight face-to-face interviews with university teachers were conducted. All the participants are public university students and teachers from Zhejiang Province and Macau. Analysis with the Rasch rating scale model found that in each subscale, the data fit the Rasch model well, the reliability of the scale was good, and substantial differential item functioning was detected by gender and location respectively. The analysis gave a profile of university students’ perceptions on the importance of competencies for the twenty-first century, self-ratings on these competencies, the perceived adequacy of university education in cultivating these competencies, and the relationships between these three aspects of students’ perceptions. The results found that students attached great importance to almost all core competencies listed in the questionnaire, perceived themselves as having acquired many of these competencies to some extent, and considered their universities to be effective in developing most of the competencies explored in this study. The qualitative interviews with university students and teachers supported the quantitative survey. Students’ perceptions on the importance of core competencies have moderate correlations with self-assessments and the perceived adequacy of university education (0.76 and 0.62, respectively), while self-assessments and the perceived adequacy of university education have low associations (0.24). No substantial differences in gender, grade and location were found in the students’ perceptions on these three aspects. Based on these findings, some discussions were conducted in which the importance of the students’ role was emphasised in determining the development of core competencies in the students themselves, and implications of how to select and develop core competencies for twenty-first century university education in Chinese university students were suggested.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,Core competencies for the twenty-first century university education,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Core competencies for the twenty-first century university education: An investigation into students' perceptions in two Chinese societies ISBN: 9781339184531,,,,,Educational psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are three critical gaps in our understanding of how to meet these goals while upholding climate commitments. First, there is a need for high-resolution open-source models that provide a clear representation of who lacks access considering tier access levels in rural and urban East Africa. Second, we require a better understanding of the level of access countries aim to achieve and the resulting implications. Finally, as countries work towards achieving universal energy access targets in a carbon-constrained world, there is an opportunity to incorporate the demand for transportation services into energy planning efforts at an early stage. Addressing these gaps is crucial to creating effective policies that promote equitable access to clean energy sources and mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change in East Africa. This dissertation is motivated by the fact that inadequate data hinders the ability of stakeholders to make sound decisions at the national level regarding issues such as energy poverty. Chapter 2 of this dissertation introduces the first version of the Temoa East Africa model, offering a detailed parameterization of supply, electricity, building, and transport sector technologies, and includes carbon removal and hydrogen production pathways. The open-source model seeks to encourage further collaboration and sustainable energy planning in East Africa. Future work aims to incorporate more detailed transportation service demand data, electric vehicle charging station characterizations, and extended technology characterizations to the industrial and agricultural sectors. Concurrently, climate change is a reality, and there is an immediate and urgent call to reduce human-made emissions. Therefore, energy access goals must be met in a carbon-constrained world. Using the Temoa East Africa model, Chapter 3 examines the impacts of different energy access definitions on final energy consumption, least-cost technology mix, emissions, and costs by access tier group. The findings emphasize the importance of identifying obstacles and opportunities for each access tier to progress towards equitable energy access and low-carbon pathways, including policies that promote access to modern, efficient, and cleaner energy sources, particularly in rural households. The shift towards natural gas and electricity in higher access tier groups can facilitate progress towards a low-carbon energy system dependent on renewable energy and carbon removal technologies. Decentralized technologies such as off-grid solar PV will play a pivotal role in increasing electricity access to households in sparsely populated rural areas. Countries in Africa are not responsible for the vast majority of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, accounting for only 4% of cumulative emissions. Nevertheless, in the long term, continued reliance on fossil fuels and traditional biomass traps these nations, particularly the poorest in rural areas, in a continuous cycle of energy poverty. Chapter 4 develops a long-term land-based passenger and freight transport demand model to support open-modeling community efforts in developing countries, including East Africa. The findings suggest that middle-income countries in Asia, such as India and China, show the highest expected transport demand across all scenarios. Low-income countries in the sub-Saharan African region are likely to experience the largest growth in demand for passenger and freight transport services. Sustainably meeting this growing demand will require the adoption of data-driven transport planning tools and leveraging cross-linkages across other energy sectors, such as electricity. Overall, this dissertation provides valuable insights into sustainable energy planning in East Africa, highlighting the need for data-driven tools and policies that promote equitable access to clean energy sources while meeting clearly defined universal energy access targets. Achieving universal energy access goals that enable development while adhering to climate mitigation targets necessitates the use of open-source data-driven tools to aid country-level decision-making in East Africa. <pre><code><br></code></pre>",2023,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,10647562 Bytes,,,,,,Energy Access and Climate Mitigation,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 10647562 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many governments have attempted or considered implementing policies or projects aimed at re-creating the success of Silicon Valley. However, it is not clear that we truly know what led to Silicon Valley’s success, as existing work has not pursued industry-wide firm-level analyses to examine the mechanisms that allowed Silicon Valley to emerge as a key region. This work seeks to begin to address this literature gap in order to better inform regional economic development policy moving forward. In examining the development of Silicon Valley and the semiconductor industry, a detailed analysis of the technological developments leading to both transistors and integrated circuits was performed. From this analysis, it became clear that the nature and availability of knowledge changed significantly between the transistor and integrated circuit eras, with knowledge becoming more complex, tacit, and less available throughout the industry. From this understanding, specific predictions and hypotheses regarding firm and industry development were generated guided by existing theory. Using a novel dataset of US semiconductor production between 1947 and 1987, this dissertation examines empirically the development of the semiconductor industry to test these hypotheses. The results show that the mechanisms driving success differed between the two eras of the semiconductor industry. As the industry transitioned to the transistor era, existing electronics firms dominated the industry, which resulted in a build-up of transistor firms in the same clusters that previously produced electronics products; however, this was not the case as the industry transitioned to integrated circuits. The nature of the knowledge in the integrated circuit era allowed spinoff firms to emerge as an important force in the industry, out-performing incumbent firms, which ultimately led to the emergence of Silicon Valley as the primary semiconductor industry cluster. It is important to understand the technological context that created an opportunity for spinoff firms to fuel Silicon Valley’s ascension to significance within the industry, as this dissertation demonstrates that the applicability of existing theories regarding firm entry and development are influenced by the nature of technology. Understanding the conditions under which various mechanisms can be effective in promoting firm entry and performance, and thus regional clusters is vital in order to craft efficient public policy and projects aimed at building industry clusters in the future. This dissertation contributes greatly to that understanding.",5/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720194.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis is motivated by a desire to determine if convincing evidence exists that the lack of diplomats' technical knowledge and/or existing relational difficulties between the diplomat and the technical expert have negative effects on international agreements. The first required step, the focus of this thesis, is to gain an understanding of the technical expert and the diplomat's relationship. This thesis has examined, as a case study, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Office of External Relations' (OER) diplomats - officially known as international program specialists (IPS). The IPSs were interviewed and the data was analyzed using the grounded theory coding process. Statistics and charts were produced from pre-interview questionnaires and competency data and used as supporting evidence for the interview data. The thesis question is expressed and answered through its three sub-questions: What is the IPS's working relationship with scientists and engineers? How do IPSs go about writing the technical content of agreements? What is the IPS' technical competence? The collective answer is that an IPS does not generate the technical content of agreements, but relies heavily on the technical expert for both the content and its clarification. This lack of technical competence is supported by the fact that only 1% of reported OER's employees' competencies are technical (hard math and science) and only 4% are technically related. Additionally, hypotheses were drawn: An evaluation of the current IPS orientation process and OER training procedures may show that, despite perceived difficulties, the practices are the best available; An increased understanding of the IPS's role, on behalf of the technical experts - especially the field experts, should improve the relationship between the IPS and the technical expert; The technical competence of an IPS is, to some degree, dependent on both (1) the working relationship an IPS has with the technical expert and (2) the IPS' capability, capacity, and desire to learn. The study largely implies that the lack of understanding of the diplomat's role may also be apparent in other technical organizations where the method of diplomacy aiding science and technology is practiced.",2010,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,A case study in science and technology diplomacy,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: A case study in science and technology diplomacy : understanding diplomats' technical competency and interaction with technical experts,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What factors explain this travel behavior and what sort of policy responses are required to effect changes? In responding to this question, we used multiple test beds and made the case for a demand side management approach to remedy parking problems particularly observed in cities central business districts. To this end, we provide an overview of travel behavior and information on policy levers by generating detailed profiles that capture the travel behavior of commuters in the Pacific states of the continental United States. Building off the result that revealed San Francisco as an outlier, we examine the efficacy of modifying parking rates, via elasticity measures, to influence the demand for parking by developing a two-stage panel data regression optimization model for managing parking in the City of San Francisco. A key contribution of the research is deriving these price elasticities of parking demand estimates using panel data methods. Coefficient estimates from the panel data regression are used to fit a linear prediction model that is the primary input to the optimization model. The balance of the thesis focuses on parking information by discussing the design and implementation of ParkPGH, a novel smart parking application that provides real time and predictive information on garage parking availability in downtown Pittsburgh. At its core is a predictive model that uses as input historical parking, weather and event data to provide estimates of available parking spaces.

We propose a methodology to create a data-driven decision process for post-disaster resource allocation that enables timely, transparent and consistent decision-making during crisis. Our methodology defines the decisions that must be made, identifies relevant historical, initial, and trending data sources, and develops numerical thresholds, quantitative relationships, and optimization models to support decision making. The general process also offers flexibility to consider non-quantitative factors and spans multiple review periods. We apply this methodology to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) program for establishing and managing Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs) after a disaster. A detailed case study of one disaster response and relevant historical data provide the basis for DRC decision making thresholds, relationships, and optimization models. We then apply the newly developed process to several recent disaster response scenarios and find that FEMA could have reduced cost by 60-80% while providing sufficient capacity for survivors. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of the methodology to other post-disaster programs along with limitations and potential future work.",2014,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Data-driven resource allocation decisions,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Data-driven resource allocation decisions : FEMA's disaster recovery centers,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FNNVUFS6,thesis,2016,"Zhang, Xuebin",Domain-Specific Solid-State Data Storage Systems Design,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1902207402?pq-origsite=primo,"The steady bit cost reduction over the past decade has enabled NAND flash memory to play an increasingly important role in numerous applications from enterprise data centers to portable mobile devices. As the society enters the big data era, it is imperative to take advantage of low-cost, high-speed NAND flash memory to optimize the design and implementation of storage systems. Nevertheless, bit cost reduction of flash memory inevitably couples with raw storage reliability degradation and limited lifespan, which causes serious challenges and meanwhile brings opportunities for research innovations. This thesis presents design solutions that address these challenges for different application domains, which share the common theme of cohesively exploiting domain-specific system-level characteristics and flash memory design. Aiming to facilitate the use of flash memory for video caching in content delivery systems, this thesis presents a set of orthogonal design techniques that leverage the characteristics of video coding to optimize flash memory fault tolerance. Motivated by the observation that general-purpose flash-based storage devices provide a finer-than-necessary data access granularity for video storage, this thesis presents a more flexible ECC (error correction coding) scheme to improve the lifetime of flash-based video storage. On the other hand, this thesis further explores control-stream assisted transcoding strategy to reduce the video data storage space overhead. Moreover, a reliability-aware data placement strategy is presented to further eliminate the storage overhead of control stream. The developed techniques can improve the overall lifetime of flash memory by more than 60% for video data storage. In computing systems, data being written to the storage devices could exhibit strong temporal redundancy, especially for hot data that are frequently updated over a short period. Such temporal data content redundancy leads to excessive write amplification, which essentially wastes the limited lifetime of flash memory. Due to the out-of-place update mechanism of NAND flash memory, this could further leads to large storage space utilization. To alleviate this storage space waste and improve the lifetime, this thesis presents an opportunistic in-place delta compression for NAND flash memory. Leveraging the progressive-programming feature of SLC-mode flash memory pages, this thesis proposes a design solution that can apply delta lossless compression to minimize write amplification caused by temporal redundancy and meanwhile simplify the data management of deltas storage. Experiments show that the developed design solution can reduce up to 80% write stress with almost negligible latency overhead. Transparent compression is also an effective means to reduce the data amount written into flash memory. Nevertheless, transparent compression is not widely applied in commercial mobile devices because of the latency penalty. In conventional practice on implementing transparent compression, read latency overhead comes from two aspects, including read amplification and decompression computational latency. This thesis presents cross-layer design solutions to eliminate the read amplification at the file system level and eliminate the computational latency overhead at the computer architecture level. To demonstrate its practical feasibility, this thesis first implements a prototyping file system to empirically verify the realization of transparent compression with zero read amplification. This thesis further demonstrates that the OS/Apps footprint can be reduced by up to 39% on a Nexus 7 tablet installed with Android 5.0, and Apps' launching time could be reduced by over 26%. Through ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) design, this thesis shows that the proposed computer architecture level design solution can eliminate the decompression latency overhead with very small implementation cost.",2016,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,Ann Arbor,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Domain-Specific Solid-State Data Storage Systems Design ISBN: 9781369773392,,,,,Computer engineering; Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Second, we find strong evidence of diurnal variation in loading times, highlighting the impact of network and server load on end-user QoE. Third, we show instances of localized congestion that severely impair the performance of some websites when measured from a residential provider. Fourth, we find that web loading times correlate with the size of a website's infrastructure as estimated by the number of IP addresses observed in the data.

FQ3GG9MB,thesis,2016,"Krones, Jonathan Seth; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",Accounting for non-hazardous industrial waste in the United States,,,,,,"This dissertation presents a method for estimating the tonnage and composition of non-hazardous industrial waste (NHIW) flows in the United States. For thirty years, it has been an accepted fact that NHIW is generated at a rate of 6.9 billion Mg per year, making it the largest waste flow in the country by more than an order of magnitude. However, this value was generated in 1985, has not been updated since, and is thought to account largely for the weight of dilute process water disposed in surface impoundments rather than solid waste generated by industry. To address this data gap, and lacking the resources to collect new, national-scale information, I propose an approach by which three independent estimates of NHIW generation based on existing data are used to corroborate each other at the industry sector level. The individual estimates are compared in triangulation so as to control for the errors, uncertainties and other validity concerns unique to each. The methods are: forecasting from historical waste accounts, modeling industrial materials flows to calculate lost mass, and up-scaling state-level data reported to the Pennsylvania Residual Waste Program. I apply the triangulation method to three industrial sectors for the year 2010, yielding estimates of (all in million Mg) 9.7-14.9 from pulp and paper, 21.2-24.7 from iron and steel, and 0.96-1.24 from petroleum refining. These values suggest that the total quantity of NHIW is measured in the hundreds of millions of Mg, not the billions as claimed by the prevailing EPA account. It therefore appears that NHIW generation rates are comparable to those of municipal solid waste. Accurate waste accounting based on reliable, repeatable, and efficient methods is an important tool for characterizing current environmental challenges and understanding trends and the effects of key drivers. Waste accounts are also essential for developing and tracking progress on sustainability strategies like industrial symbiosis, in which wastes like NHIW are used as substitutes for raw materials throughout the economy. The method developed here satisfies these needs and answers what has been an open question for nearly three decades.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 Ph.D.,Book Title: Accounting for non-hazardous industrial waste in the United States,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FS3BYTS7,thesis,2013,"Ebenhag, Sven-Christian",Frequency Transfer Techniques and Applications in Fiber Optic Communication Systems,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2400304691?pq-origsite=primo,"Modern society is dependent on communications and the developments of these increases constantly through a seemingly endless demand for communication services and thereby synchronization and time. This is confirmed by a vast range of research on communications, irrespective of technology and protocol. Historically, the national metrology institutes are the distributors of stable accurate time and frequency through national timescales, but that situation has changed with the arrival of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS (Global Positioning System). The introduction of GNSS-based solutions has resulted in improvement for system users and owners in need of time and frequency. When using a GNSS receiver, sufficient accuracy and precision is often achieved. However, a disadvantage of this development is that GNSS-solutions are based on weak radio signals that can be interfered with. The main objective of the research that forms the groundwork for this thesis is the development of new fiber based methods for time and frequency. The aim is to complement GNSS-based methods for redundancy, with the intention of strengthening the robustness of the Swedish infrastructure. The research has resulted in two unique and innovative transmission technologies, one of which has been patented (two-color, one-way).The first method is based on a non-insertion technology that utilizes passive listening to existing data frames in a fiber optical network and does not require any particular bandwidth. This technology only uses a fraction of the optical signal for time and frequency measurement from an indirect connection to the network. This method has resulted in a precision relative to the GPS carrier phase of less than 1 ns root mean square for distances exceeding 1,100 km. This precision has been achieved for all of the included experiments, conducted within the framework of the thesis, regardless of configuration.The other fiber based technology is a one-way method that uses two wavelengths (colors) for the realization of a correction algorithm and signals thereto. It was developed because the symmetry required for performing two-way time and frequency transfer is rarely precise enough.This optical fiber technique was evaluated with respect to a GPS precise point positioning technique in an urban fiber optical network. The difference in frequency stability between the two systems has been shown to be about 3 × 10-15 over an averaging interval of 10,000 s for a distance of 3 km.

FTEDPZ9E,thesis,2015,"Collins, Ross D.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Using inclusive wealth as a measure of sustainability for infrastructure planning and evaluation,,,,,,"Inclusive wealth (IW) measures the productive base of an economy, which is a linear index of its capital asset stocks. Changes to IW per capita over time track changes to intergenerational human well-being, thus non-declining IW per capita indicates sustainable development. National IW has only been measured retrospectively; this dissertation models and projects IW prospectively, measuring the impact of alternative infrastructure plans on IW. The focus of the work is on electricity planning in oil-exporting countries. Domestic oil consumption in these countries, driven by increasing electricity use, threatens long-term development by reducing the export revenue on which the government and economy depends. First, I develop a system dynamics model that connects electric power capacity expansion with macroeconomic development, tabulating both infrastructure costs and impacts to the capital stocks of IW over time. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is the primary case study. Second, I analyze the capital stock projections generated by the model across a range of scenarios and countries. Under the baseline IW formulation, KSA experiences a negative annual growth rate to inclusive wealth per capita to 2050. However, adjusted formulations allow the possibility of periods of positive growth, and a non-oil sector that is less dependent on the oil sector will shift the IW trajectory upwards. Compared to KSA, Kuwait is likely to experience larger per capita declines in IW. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), on the other hand, will potentially experience positive growth rates in per capita IW starting in 2028. Third, I analyze the IW impacts of non-fossil investments in electricity infrastructure, specifically nuclear and solar, between now and 2050. In KSA, the produced capital benefits of non-fossil investment outweigh the oil capital costs (to finance the infrastructure) across a range of uncertainties. Including human capital benefits raises net benefits by an order of magnitude. The optimal allocation of nuclear and solar power ultimately depends on the evaluation metric used. The UAE gains least from non-fossil investment, since it uses comparatively less oil in its electricity system, while Kuwait experiences gains similar to KSA. Importantly, using IW as the basis for electricity policy evaluation yields qualitatively different prescriptions than a least-cost capacity expansion model.",2015,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: Using inclusive wealth as a measure of sustainability for infrastructure planning and evaluation,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of Monte Carlo simulations provide insight about the computed level of reliability considering site standard penetration test blow count value variability alone (i.e., assuming all other aspects of the design problem do not contribute error or bias). Evaluated methods include Eurocode 7 Geotechnical Design procedures, the Federal Highway Administration drilled shaft LRFD design method, the Electric Power Research Institute transmission foundation design procedure and a site specific variability based approach previously suggested by the author of this thesis and others. The analysis method is defined by three phases: a) Evaluate the spatial variability of an existing subsurface database. b) Derive theoretical foundation designs from the database in accordance with the various design methods identified. c) Conduct Monti Carlo Simulations to compute the reliability of the theoretical foundation designs. Over several decades, reliability-based foundation design (RBD) methods have been developed and implemented to varying degrees for buildings, bridges, electric systems and other structures. In recent years, an effort has been made by researchers, professional societies and other standard-developing organizations to publish design guidelines, manuals and standards concerning RBD for foundations. Most of these approaches rely on statistical methods for quantifying load and resistance probability distribution functions with defined reliability levels. However, each varies with regard to the influence of site-specific variability on resistance. An examination of the influence of site-specific variability is required to provide direction for incorporating the concept into practical RBD design methods. Recent surveys of transmission line engineers by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) demonstrate RBD methods for the design of transmission line foundations have not been widely adopted. In the absence of a unifying design document with established reliability goals, transmission line foundations have historically performed very well, with relatively few failures. However, such a track record with no set reliability goals suggests, at least in some cases, a financial premium has likely been paid.",2014,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Probabilistic Based Assessment of the Influence of Nonlinear Soil Behavior and Stratification on the Performance of Laterally Loaded Drilled Pier Foundations ISBN: 9781303889028,,,,,Civil engineering; Geotechnical engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bottom-up ESOMs simulate technology-level decisions within an energy system, including interactions across economic sectors. These models include detailed techno-economic technological representation of individual technologies, requiring inputs including capital, fixed, and variable costs, energy consumption, technology lifetime, and emissions factors. The results provide insight into possible future energy systems, including the total system cost, technology capacity, energy use, and emissions, based on current techno-economic data and assumptions. In this thesis, I use the Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa), an open-source bottom-up ESOM, to simulate the US energy system under various decarbonization policies. In Chapter 2, I simulate the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in conjunction with various policy instruments to understand how the US can meet its stated climate goals. Specifically, I compare a carbon tax to a combination of technology and fuel standards, finding that the average GHG abatement cost under the modeled standards is comparable to a carbon tax set at ~$200/ton CO2-eq, and both policies achieve similar emissions reductions. In Chapter 3, I develop an algorithm to translate regional air pollution from the transportation and electric sectors to the county resolution, then link the results to an integrated assessment model. I then quantify air pollution exposure and disparity across racial groups under six different policies, including a 2050 net-zero target. I find that existing disparities persist until at least 2030, particularly for Black non-Hispanic Americans. After 2035, the strictest policies approach racial equity, achieving at least an 80% reduction in disparity and exposure for all racial groups relative to 2020. In Chapter 4, I explore the role of hydrogen in decarbonizing steel production in the US. I find that, despite industry and research attention on hydrogen-based direct reduced iron (H2DRI), this technology is only a cost-effective decarbonization strategy under a very narrow set of conditions. Under current capital and variable cost estimates of US steel decarbonization, we find that carbon capture technologies can achieve comparable emissions reductions relative to H2DRI at a lower price. We find that green hydrogen is deployed preferentially elsewhere in the economy under a net-zero constraint. Additionally, we find that IRA tax credits are insufficient to drive hydrogen use in steelmaking, and for sustained H2DRI use, a tax credit specifically aimed at promoting green steel production would need to be as high as $300 per tonne steel produced.",4/19/24,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:41,,,,,,,An Energy Systems Model Approach to US Decarbonization,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/25452034.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The adoption of natural gas vehicles could lead to impacts on energy and environmental systems. An analysis of the main factors and trends that affect adoption of natural gas vehicles such as vehicle costs, infrastructure costs, and fuel economics was performed. The fuel cost analysis showed that assuming production and distribution at scale, liquefied natural gas (LNG) can be competitive as a diesel fuel substitute for heavy duty vehicles in the US, and also in EU and China. A methodology of incorporating heavy duty natural gas vehicles into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) economic modelling was developed to investigate the potential adoption and impacts. Modelling variables such as vehicle and infrastructure costs were tested and several scenarios were applied to examine the general equilibrium impacts on natural gas vehicle adoption and the general equilibrium impacts of resulting natural gas vehicle adoption. Climate policy scenarios were also developed and tested. In the base case scenario, results showed significant adoption of LNG trucks (Class 8) in the US, with 10% penetration of heavy duty trucks by 2020 and up to 100% by 2040. In China and the EU, adoption was projected to be slower due to higher natural gas prices. In the US, introduction of LNG trucks resulted in moderately higher natural gas prices, slightly lower oil prices, and a small reduction in total GHG emissions, relative to scenarios without LNG truck availability. The development of natural gas fuelled transportation is still in its infancy and CGE modelling offers a tool that can be applied to test a wide range of assumptions of cost development and relative prices.",2014,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Modelling the global prospects and impacts of heavy duty liquefied natural gas vehicles in computable general equilibrium,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To supplement this static analysis, System Dynamics models were used to analyze the social and organizational dynamics that underline the US healthcare system and to understand how the system moved from a safe to an unsafe state which allowed a dangerous drug to be left on the market for over five years. The recall of Vioxx was followed by a number of legislative changes, in particular the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act of 2007. Those changes were mapped on the safety control structure and again System Dynamics models were used to understand the systemic implications of the policy changes. The models suggested that further changes might be necessary to protect the American public and so, based on the results of the STAMP analysis, a new set of systemic recommendations was proposed.",2010,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: A case study of Vioxx using STAMP,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obesity puts substantial burden on individuals and society. Among women of reproductive age, obesity increases the risk of obstetric complications for mothers and their children. Gestational weight gain (GWG) is a potential mediator of many of the associations with prepregnancy obesity. The 2009 Institute of Medicine GWG recommendations were limited due to a lack of data by obesity severity and on the long-term outcomes of GWG. This dissertation address important research gaps related to infant and child outcomes associated with maternal nutritional status. The Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance System was used to examine trends in prepregnancy obesity among low-income women from 1999-2008 and examine the associations between GWG and fetal growth by obesity severity. We observed an overall increase in the prevalence of prepregnancy obesity with substantial variation in trends by maternal race-ethnicity. Associations between GWG and fetal growth differed by obesity severity. Among class I obese mothers, weight loss increased the odds of a growth restricted infant; however, among class II and III obese mothers, limited weight loss, compared to GWG within recommendations, was associated with more favorable birthweights. The nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort was used to examine long-term outcomes of maternal nutritional status. Associations between GWG and child adiposity at 5 years of age by maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) status were examined. No harm or benefit of low GWG was observed among all mothers. Among normal weight and overweight mothers only, GWG above recommendations was associated with an increase in child BMI z-score. The association between prepregnancy BMI and child neurodevelopment at 2 years of age was examined. Prepregnancy underweight and severe obesity were associated with poor child cognitive development. No association was observed between prepregnancy BMI and child motor development. The findings of this dissertation address critical data gaps related to infant and child outcomes of maternal nutrition status. While findings related to fetal growth suggest that GWG recommendations may be differentially lowered for obese mothers, data related to long-term outcomes is still limited due to inconsistencies the literature.",2012,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,Infant and child outcomes associated with maternal nutritional status,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Infant and child outcomes associated with maternal nutritional status: Examination of maternal prepregnancy body mass index and gestational weight gain ISBN: 9781267543899,,,,,Medicine; Nutrition; Obstetrics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The planned changes will include deployment of new commercial-off-the-shelf financial management software, and simultaneous changes to USCG organizational structures and FM processes. Proposed changes to the USCG FM system are intended to bring the Service into compliance with Federal standards for financial operations, while simultaneously improving delivery of financial business support to end users. This thesis applies Dr. Nancy Leveson's System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) safety methodology to perform a hazard analysis on aspects of the re-engineered (future state) business processes to help ensure the system can deliver its intended performance. Application of STPA on the USCG FM system was conducted with the aid of the Safety Hazard Analysis Tool (SafetyHAT) software released in March 2014 by the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center. SafetyHAT is intended to aid users in performing hazard analysis using STPA. The use of SafetyHAT for this thesis research is its first application outside of the Volpe Center and transportation domain. Recommendations for tailoring the tool to the financial management and other domains are proposed. The application of STPA on targeted aspects of the USCG FM system identified 205 causal factors for potential system hazards. Recommendations to appropriately remediate the causal factors are proposed based on systems theory principles and tools. Recommended improvements include robust feedback and communication channels illustrated using the system control diagram used to perform STPA. System dynamics modeling is also used to quantitatively illustrate the non-linear interactions that exist in the USCG FM system, and how the system design will affect its performance over time. The simulations show that if the causal factors identified using STPA are not addressed, the FM system may fail to achieve its intended performance. Other recommendations include the expanded use of system dynamic modeling to inform future design decisions for the USCG FM system, including trade-offs driven by resource limitations, as the re-engineering effort progresses.",2014,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,U.S. Coast Guard financial management,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, System Design and Management Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis SD&M 2014 S.M.,Book Title: U.S. Coast Guard financial management : a systems approach to business process reengineering,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; System Design and Management Program; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Decision Analytic Perspective,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Does_Tropical_Cyclone_Modification_Make_Sense_A_Decision_Analytic_Perspective/6716105/1,"Recent dramatic increases in damages caused by tropical cyclones (TCs) and improved understanding of TC physics have led the Department of Homeland Security to fund research on intentional hurricane modification. Here I present a decision analytic assessment of whether hurricane modification is potentially cost effective in South Florida. First, for a single storm I compare hardening buildings to lowering the wind speed of a TC by reducing sea surface temperatures with wind-wave pumps. I find that if it were feasible and properly implemented, modification could reduce net wind losses from an intense storm more than hardening structures. However, hardening provides ""fail safe"" protection for average storms that might not be achieved if the only option were modification. The effect of natural variability is larger than that of either strategy. Second, for multiple storms over a given return period, I investigate TC wind and storm surge damage reduction by hardening buildings and by wind-wave pumps. The coastal areas examined experience more surge damages for short return periods, and more wind damages for long periods. Surge damages are best reduced through a surge barrier. Wind damages are best reduced by a portfolio of techniques including wind-wave pumps, assuming they work and are correctly deployed. Damages in areas outside of the floodplain will likely be dominated by wind damages, and hence a similar portfolio will likely be best in these areas. Since hurricane modification might become a feasible strategy for reducing hurricane damages, to facilitate an informed and constructive discourse on implementation, policy makers need to understand how people perceive hurricane modification. Therefore using the mental models approach, I identified Florida residents’ perceptions of hurricane modification techniques. First, hurricane modification was perceived as a relatively ineffective strategy for damage reduction. Second, hurricane modification was expected to lead to changes in path, but not necessarily strength. Third, reported anger at hurricane modification was weaker when path was unaltered and the damages equal to or less than projected. Fourth, individuals who recognized the uncertainty inherent in hurricane prediction reported more anger at scientists across modification scenarios.",12/1/11,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Does Tropical Cyclone Modification Make Sense?,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716105.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
G8QMQJGM,thesis,2013,"Rohrbach, Amanda K.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Implementing technical transitions through schedule-based policy: insights from the Military's Airborne Tactical Network,,,,,,"Due to a need for congestion relief, as well as a projected increase in capacity constraints, the US Military's Airborne Tactical Network (ATN) is at the onset of a technical transition of their communication hardware and software. While the technical challenges appear to be addressed and agreed upon, the particular challenge lies in navigating the social and organizational challenges of decentralized control, stakeholder misalignment, network externalities, bureaucratic organizational procedures, and limited windows of opportunity. To alleviate these sources of resistance, this thesis proposes an incremental transition strategy that minimizes changes to operational procedures and distributes costs/benefits through schedule-based policy. This research developed a quantitative model to simulate a representative environment of aircraft maintenance routines, flight time, and network usage. Using this model, four incremental strategies were compared including regional, stakeholder-specific, platform-specific, and ""big bang"" approaches. By evaluating network performance improvements and representative cost profiles, this thesis contends that utilizing an incremental regional or stakeholder-specific strategy is a valid path forward for the ATN transformation. Additional research is necessary; however, to better understand the social dynamics between stakeholders and the relative magnitude of costs associated with each option. This thesis finally presents a 5th incremental strategy utilizing functional increments, which modifies the technical deployment of the systems by staging levels of upgrades sequentially over time. If this is technically viable, the results would distribute lower levels of costs over time and provide enough benefit to account for several years of anticipated growth in network demand.",2013,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,Implementing technical transitions through schedule-based policy,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2013 S.M.,Book Title: Implementing technical transitions through schedule-based policy : insights from the Military's Airborne Tactical Network,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant concerns over safety have been expressed. This research explores traditional engineering and biotechnology practices for overarching principles of design, testing and demonstration that address safety concerns. The information is used to assess the current state of design, testing and demonstration in current synthetic biology projects addressing safety. Component and system design literature provide an engineering backbone of safety systems however, biological attributes such as mutation, growth, and multiplication create safety gaps, where biological engineering practices are needed. These principles are organized into categories of design and testing, and testing and demonstration to gain greater insight on where gaps in the literature might lie. Retrospective cases of traditional engineering and current cases of biotechnologies provide external validation and further illustrate which practices address which design, testing and demonstration needs. While most of the traditional engineering cases addressed safety through design and testing, when they were faced with questions of safety, they presented specific efforts to gain public confidence. The pro-biotics case was different in that the safety concerns came from the scientific community since history is being used as the convincing demonstration of safety. The three synthetic biology research projects cross the divide between traditional engineering and biotechnologies, but theses efforts are firmly in the area of design and testing.

The earliest cetacean tags were Discovery marks developed by the British Colonial Office at the turn of the 20th century, and their influence continues to inform some of the implanted cetacean tags being deployed. Today, there are a wide variety of tags in use that can be broadly divided into two principal categories driven by the length of attachment required-disposable transmitting systems that are implanted in the animals and archival tags that must be recovered in order to collect the data. Archival tags typically use a non-invasive attachment with a release to get the data back. These tags provide essential information for conservation and management of these vulnerable species. In the United States, a broad suite of regulations protects cetaceans and other marine mammals. Welfare protection stems from the Animal Welfare Act and Conservation protection stems from the Marine Mammal Protection and Endangered Species Acts. To navigate this policy landscape, both regulators and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees need to weigh the benefits of a tagging study against the potential for serious harm and evaluate whether a proposed method is the least harmful way to answer a scientific question. However, the effects of tagging wild cetaceans are not well-understood and difficult to compare, leading to challenges for objectively assessing proposals. In this environment of uncertainty, specific guidelines from professional societies would be helpful, but varying institutional and individual approaches to the balance between conservation and welfare will make consensus difficult.

The feasibility of this strategy will partially depend on public acceptance of these technologies as part of a national energy policy. To varying degrees, public misconceptions and knowledge gaps exist for each of these low-carbon technologies. Thus, people need balanced and comparative information to make informed decisions about which low-carbon electricity technologies and portfolios to support. In this thesis, we describe paper-based and computer-based communications presenting multi-attribute descriptions about the costs, benefits, risks and limitations of ten electricity technologies and low-carbon portfolios composed of those technologies. Participants are first asked to rank the technologies under a hypothetical scenario where future power plant construction in Pennsylvania must meet a CO2 emissions constraint. Next, participants attend small group meetings where they rank seven portfolios that meet a specific CO2 emission limit. In a subsequent study, participants instead construct their own low-carbon portfolio using a computer decision tool that restricts portfolio designs to realistic technology combinations. We find that our participants could understand and consistently use our communications to help inform their decisions about low-carbon technologies. We conclude that our informed participants preferred energy efficiency, nuclear, and coal (gasification) with CCS, as well as diverse portfolios including these technologies. The thesis continues with a retrospective view for the value of research that elicits general public opinions of CCS and that develops communications to educate people about low-carbon electricity generation. In the latter, we find that the knowledge of science teachers may be insufficient to correct common public misconceptions about low-carbon technologies among their students. Thus, the communications we developed for this thesis could also benefit science teachers. Overall, we conclude that the computer tool, supplemental materials and procedure developed for this thesis may be valuable for educating the general public about low-carbon electricity generation.",5/1/11,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721184.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GMNJ2Z94,thesis,2010,"Lindsey, Johnathan Jake; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Characterizing opportunities for short reach optical interconnect adoption: a market survey and total cost of ownership model approach,,,,,,"Over the past decade, the demand for digital information has increased dramatically with the rising use of the Internet and various types of multimedia data - text, audio, graphics, video, and voice. As a consequence, the technologies that connect and transport data have become critically important. Available interconnect technologies are broadly organized into two categories: electrical and optical. Although many digital systems use electrical interconnects, optical interconnects are becoming an attractive alternative as electrical connection has become increasingly difficult in terms of cost and performance. However, the transition from electrical to optical interconnects across multiple markets could still be hampered by its higher cost relative to interconnects in the mid-term. Thus, this work seeks to shed light on the following question: ""What additional characteristics are useful to evaluate the attractiveness of optical interconnects in emerging markets?"" This thesis seeks to explore and answer this question in three parts. The first part of the thesis attempts to gauge the opportunities and barriers to optical interconnect adoption in emerging markets through an analysis of first phase interviews with professionals working in the datacom, automobile, consumer hand-held device industries. Initial review of the response set shows that of the five initial emerging markets for optical interconnect, datacom, specifically high-performance computing (HPC), has the greatest potential for increased optical interconnect adoption in the near future. To further explore the environment for optical interconnects in the HPC, a second, more detailed questionnaire was distributed to a limited number of interviewees. In response to this interview, some respondents noted that several metrics other than cost and performance, particularly power consumption, as being ""very important"" when deciding which technology to adopt. The second part of the thesis is primarily concerned with investigating further the influence that power and performance concerns have on optical interconnect adoption in HPC data centers. Specifically, this part of the thesis seeks to explore whether power concerns in data centers could lead to increased adoption of optical interconnects. To that end, a cost model of an HPC data center has been developed to identify the possible economic impacts that the adoption of optical interconnect technologies would have in a power-driven scenario. The third part of this thesis presents a set of policy recommendations based on the results from the data center cost model.",2010,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,Characterizing opportunities for short reach optical interconnect adoption,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: Characterizing opportunities for short reach optical interconnect adoption : a market survey and total cost of ownership model approach,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A full climate model, the IGSM-CAM, was first used to force CLM-AG and show the regional disparity of the response to climate change. Some areas like the Midwest or Equatorial Africa benefit from the higher precipitations associated to climate change while others like Europe or Southern Africa see the irrigation need for crops increase. The effect of a mitigation policy appeared contrasted, as water-stress for some areas (including Europe and Africa) is increased if greenhouse gases emissions are limited while for other areas (Central Asia, United States) it is reduced. A second analysis was carried in Central Zambia using uncertainty ensembles. The ensembles demonstrate the notable extent of the uncertainty stemming from different climate sensitivities and different regional patterns in climate models. Crops are impacted differently but a consistent result is that climate mitigation policies reduce uncertainty in crop water stress, making it easier to plan for any anticipated future climate change.",2012,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,Crop water stress under climate change uncertainty,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2012 S.M.,Book Title: Crop water stress under climate change uncertainty : global policy and regional risk,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grounding my interdisciplinary approach in infrastructure asset management practice and social justice theory, I develop several analytical methods for conducting quantitative equity screenings, determining the socioeconomic impacts of infrastructure quality, and rectifying inequities through improved project selection. Previous studies of community-level impacts have either focused on individual projects or the distribution of roadway condition across a single city. Thus, the distribution of infrastructure condition, maintenance actions during the operational life of the assets, and the associated impacts on the neighboring communities are under-studied. To complement these important studies and inform the stakeholder engagement processes that emanate from them, I scale quantitative social equity screenings to state and national infrastructure management programs. For nationwide studies of bridge and highway inventories, I find that the risks and burdens associated with roads and bridges in poor condition have asymmetrically been borne by socioeconomically disadvantaged and marginalized communities (Study 1, Chapter 2). Through econometric assessments of the communities near the highway, I find that the burdens from poor condition highways are associated with less employment, lower earnings, and less vehicle commuting (Study 2, Chapter 3). For bridges in the United States, I show that addressing these inequities with socially-aware project selecting criteria is feasible within realistic budgets and does not decrease the overall performance of the inventory (Study 3, Chapter 4). Beyond transportation infrastructure management in the United States, these methods could be adapted to assess equity and prioritize investment plans for a myriad of infrastructure systems and public services that have long life-cycles and entrenched footprints such as dams, tunnels, and other such assets.",5/10/24,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:54,5/20/25 15:47,,,,,,,Social Equity in Transportation Infrastructure Management,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/25747095.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GWGTPJA9,thesis,2015,"Raheem, Muhammad Arslan","A comparative study of the attitudes of students attending urdu medium, english medium and seminary schools in pakistan",,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1784060319?pq-origsite=primo,"In Pakistan, educational institutions function in parallel under three separate systems: public, private and madrassas. The incidents of 9/11 brought madrassas into the limelight and they emerged as the most controversial educational institutions of Pakistan. International scholarship is polarized on the madrassa issue and presents two opposing pictures about these institutes. For some, madrassas are the cause of radical ideology and militancy, while for others they are a source of free education for the underprivileged. This research compares the attitudes of students attending madrassas with those of students attending other types of school. A comparison of the world view of students coming from different schooling systems was made concerning socio-political and educational issues including an examination of attitudes towards jihad and Islamic militancy. It is argued that students educated under different systems have divergent ideologies about the primary purpose of education, sectarian diversity, the status of women and non-Muslims in Pakistan and, most importantly, Islamic militancy. To determine the worldview of students about the aforesaid issues, both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used. The data were collected from the students of private and public schools and madrassas in South Punjab (N=500). It is argued that madrassas are stratified with some being more liberal than others. The questionnaire and interview tool used in the study attempted to find out the students‘ responses on armed Jihad, sectarian divide, the status of women, the position of non-Muslims in Pakistan and about the purpose of education. The analysis illustrated the ways in which Pakistani society is polarized along socio-economic lines and how different types of schooling are associated with distinct world views. The results indicate that the students from madrassas are somewhat more aggressive and intolerant towards the religious minorities and women than the students of English medium and Urdu medium public schools. They are also less tolerant towards people of other sects and are more susceptible to sectarian prejudices than their counterparts in the English medium and Urdu medium schools. In the same vein, the students from madrassas are more supportive of militancy and jihadist activities than their counterparts. In this regard, the students from Shia and Brailvi madrassas are comparatively less inclined towards the Jihadi notion than that of Ahle Hadith, Deaoband and Jamaat-e-Islami madrassas. While most previous studies of madrassas have presented them as homogeneous institutions, this study highlights the extent to which they are internally stratified and shows that the students studying in these schools have contradictory viewpoints with respect to certain socio-political and religious issues.",2015,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: A comparative study of the attitudes of students attending urdu medium, english medium and seminary schools in pakistan",,,,,Education; Islam; Muslims; Public schools,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GWXVRSVD,thesis,2009,"Nadeau, Marie-Claude; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Evaluating manufacturing flexibility driven by learning,,,,,,"A defining feature of modern industry is operating in a context of nearly continuous technological change. Nevertheless, industrial decision-makers must select technologies and implement production strategies even in the face of known-to-be-incomplete information and environmental uncertainties. Further complicating the picture, the performance, including the economic performance, associated with novel technology options is likely to change over time. To address this problem, two approaches are possible: improving the quality of currently available information, and implementing flexible production strategies. The present work characterizes how the former approach impacts the valuation of the latter. First, a dynamic approach integrating learning curves and process-based cost modeling is used to examine learning in manufacturing, thus allowing decision-makers to incorporate information about expected technology evolution into their economic evaluations of technology. The approach is applied to an automotive assembly process, and quantifies the cost impacts of learning improvements in manufacturing time, downtime, and defect rates. Analysis can be used to focus learning activities on primary learning operational drivers, and to forecast cost improvements for a novel process. Flexibility strategies are often focused on capital-intensive processes, while labor-intensive processes are thought to be inherently flexible. The existence of learning effects, however, implies that labor flexibility has costs and, potentially, benefits in the context of uncertainty. A simple automotive assembly case is used here to illustrate the impact of manufacturing learning on labor flexibility and its economic value. A framework using cash-flow and decision tree models is introduced to quantify the costs and benefits of acquiring worker flexibility, and improve information available for strategic decision-making in labor-intensive systems. The front-end characterization of the technical drivers of learning provides insight into how the value of flexibility can be impacted at the operational level, enabling managers to prioritize improvements and minimize the costs of flexibility.",2009,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2009 S.M.,Book Title: Evaluating manufacturing flexibility driven by learning,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GXR4J62B,thesis,2014,"Jenn, Alan Theodore",Advanced and Alternative Fuel Vehicle Policies: Regulations and Incentives in the United States,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Advanced_and_Alternative_Fuel_Vehicle_Policies_Regulations_and_Incentives_in_the_United_States/6714608/1,"Transportation policy is playing an increasingly important role in the transition towards more fuel-efficient vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). Whether the policy seeks to promote adoption through mandatory requirements or through monetary incentives, or to address issues related to adoption of AFVs, it is clear that such policies can have large-ranging impacts on the future of the US transportation system. The work I conduct in my dissertation seeks to understand these policies, in the past, present, and future. I evaluate the effects of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT) on the adoption of HEVs. As part of EPACT, a tax credit incentives program was implemented for consumers purchasing HEVs. Using a unique fixed effects regression approach with lagged instrumental variables, I am able to estimate the effects of the incentives. I find most significant responses occur when incentives exceed $1,000 in tax cd credit. Depending on the vehicle model the presence of EPACT yielded increases in sales of 5% to 15%. This increase is relatively smaller compared to many existing studies, which my work indicates is likely the result of over-attribution of sales to policy. I go on to examine the effects of the adoption of electric vehicles on funding for transportation infrastructure. A significant portion of revenue for transportation infrastructure comes from taxes on gasoline, these funds will likely be diminished to some extent as electric vehicles are adopted as they consume little to no gasoline as fuel. Using several existing electric vehicle models, I find that at the per-vehicle level, revenue generation can be upwards of 50% lower in certain states depending on how fees are charged. The total annual revenue generation at the federal level could decrease by as much as $200 million by 2025, though this is quite a small portion of total revenues for transportation infrastructure. I demonstrate that the revenue decrease can easily be made up through small policy fee changes in either flat fixed or through incremental increases in use fees, though implementation of such policies can be difficult politically. I also focus on the recent implementation of alternative fuel vehicle incentives in the 2009 update of the CAFE standards. I demonstrate that while the AFV incentives help spur the production and adoption of AFVs, there is a short-term emissions penalty due to the structure of the policy. i find that every AFV sold results in an increase in emissions rate for another vehicle of 50-400 grams of CO2 per mile, comparable to adding an additional conventional vehicle onto the road. The cumulative effect is an increase of 20 to 70 million metric tons of CO2 for vehicles sold between 2012 and 2025. I further extends this work by investigating how other policies promoting AFV sales interact with the CAFE policy. I focus specifically on the California ZEV mandate interaction and find that there is an increase of 120 million metric tons of CO2 for new cars sold between 2012 and 2025. The analysis also demonstrates a counter intuitive effect: the greater the success of ZEV in inducing adoption of AFVs, the greater the short-term emissions penalty due to the two policies. Finally I examines the response of driving behavior response to changes in gasoline prices. Using a unique dataset obtained from Pennsylvania's Department of Transportation, we are able to observe annual driving behavior at the individual vehicle level from 2000 through 2010. We observe heterogeneity of price elasticities using two methods: separating data by quantiles over the factors of interest and by interacting the factors of interest as categorical variables with gasoline prices. We find statistically significant variations in elasticities: for driving intensities we observe values of -0.172 increasing up to -0.0576 as the amount driven annually increases, for gasoline prices we observe a range of elasticities from -0.002 to -0.05 for prices below $4/gallon with a sudden increase to -0.182 for prices above $4/gallon, lastly for fuel economies we find that below 20 MPG elasticities are highest at -0.173 with decreasing responsiveness as vehicle fuel economy increases. Heterogeneity needs to be accounted for in order to properly understand policy effects: responses based on average elasticity values are likely to be incorrect.",5/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:23,,,,,,,Advanced and Alternative Fuel Vehicle Policies,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714608.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/4XFN3KPX/Jenn - 2014 - Advanced and Alternative Fuel Vehicle Policies Regulations and Incentives in the United States.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The monetization of QoS of data can be managed by traffic management and performance optimization policies. This traffic prioritization can be application specific as well as application agnostic, but essentially based on user choice and in compliance with Net Neutrality principles. The mobile operators' quest to evolve from their ""dumb bit pipe"" role to become more involved in shaping the user experience through collaborative innovation with application developers and content providers is the main driver behind this concept. Three case studies, have been evaluated in this thesis, namely 1) zero.facebook.com, where Facebook collaborates with mobile operators across the world to bundle a stripped down Facebook application version with a mobile connection, 2) collaboration between Google Voice and Sprint where Sprint is adding Over The Top Google Voice minutes to its mobile plans, and 3) NTT DoCoMo's i-mode, which served as a revolutionary concept in the mobile services, as a traditional mobile operator reshaped the consumer experience through customized service offerings and by getting involved in almost all sectors of the telecommunication value chain. The common parameters identified in these case studies, combined with the findings of interviews with over fifty stakeholders across the telecommunications value chain, have been brought together in the aggregated model presented in this thesis; ""collaborative innovation"" and ""user experience control"" are identified as two significant factors driving the rationale behind monetization of QoS of mobile data.

H32785WJ,thesis,2021,"Jiang, Bomin; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Identification and robustness in central banking and supply chain,,,,,,"In this thesis, we study identification and robustness issues in central banking and supply chains. First, we present a methodology to identify multiple linear financial networks when only an aggregate outcome is observed, and use the method to assess financial networks among financial institutions in the United States. We discover that the data is better explained by a mix of distinct networks, each of which corresponds to a different transmission mechanism. Second, we investigate the effect of bounded uncertainty in central banking, and derive robust decision rules for central banking policymaking. When bounded uncertainty is passed through a conditional expectation channel, we find that committing not to use a policy tool is sometimes optimal for the central bank. An asset purchasing model and a forward guidance model are examined in depth to illustrate our point. Third, we study a stylized supply chain model where large aggregate shock hits and prices are not adjusted due to anti-price gouging laws. We show that individual producers, in this case, will not diversify for aggregate shock due to the externality of fixed prices. Multinational corporations, on the other hand, would still diversify their supply chain due to continuation value. Furthermore, a robustness analysis shows that individual producers will not diversify even when they adopt robust decision rules, but multinational corporations will further diversify their supply chain in this case. The first two chapters tackle the real-world challenge of financial systemic risk reflected by the 2008 financial crisis, and the proliferation of monetary policy tools thereafter. The third chapter tries to analyze the supply chain disruption caused by the outbreak of the Covid-19 global pandemic, and give policy suggestions based on our model.",2021,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Identification and robustness in central banking and supply chain,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The energy consumption of ICT in general and data centers in particular has been of growing interest to both industry and the public, with continued calls for increased efficiency and greater focus on environmental impacts. The first study examines the metrics used to assess data center energy performance and finds that power usage effectiveness (PUE), the de facto industry standard, only accounts for one of four critical aspects of data center energy performance. PUE measures the overhead of the facility infrastructure but does not consider the efficiency of the IT equipment, its utilization, or the emissions profile of the power source. As a result, PUE corresponds poorly with energy and carbon efficiency, as demonstrated using a small set of empirical data center energy use measurements. The second study lays out a taxonomy of indirect energy impacts to help assess whether ICT’s direct energy consumption is offset by its energy benefits, and concludes that ICT likely has a large potential net energy benefit, but that there is no consensus on the sign or magnitude of actual savings, which are largely dependent upon implementation details. The third study estimates the potential of dynamic load shifting in a content distribution network to reduce both private costs and emissions-related externalities associated with electricity consumption. Utilizing variable marginal retail prices based on wholesale electricity markets and marginal damages estimated from emissions data in a cost-minimization model, the analysis finds that load shifting can either reduce data center power bills by approximately 25%–33% or avoid 30%–40% of public damages, while a range of joint cost minimization strategies enables simultaneous reduction of both private and public costs. The vast majority of these savings can be achieved even under existing bandwidth and network distance constraints, although current industry trends towards virtualization, energy efficiency, and green powermay make load shifting less appealing.",8/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:29,,,,,,,Powering the Information Age,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721103.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the United States, there has been much debate on the merits and faults of increasing variable renewable energy, natural gas, and nuclear capacity; and because the depth to which all are willing to decarbonize is contested, direction from an overarching national policy is lacking. The absence of a formulaic policy offers the opportunity to explore fossil-fuel fleet reduction opportunities that do not advocate the wholesale replacement of the fleet with a zero-carbon technology, and allows for flexibility and the utilization of existing incentives to nudge the carbon-emitting fleet to emissions reduction. In this dissertation, I examine the role competing mitigation technologies under these conditions can play in decarbonizing the fossil-fuel fleet. To do so, I develop a tool for least-cost emission reductions, use this tool to quantify uncertainty and determine regret in the complex mitigation decision, and analyze the impact that the U.S. tax code has on this choice.",7/14/22,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,,,,,,,Marching to the beat of an absent drummer,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/20301786.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/99MMD5KT/Anderson - 2022 - Marching to the beat of an absent drummer Carbon Dioxide Emissions Reduction in the U.S. Power Sect.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disappearances and murdered women in the border town of Cd. Juarez and throughout the country are reported in the news headlines every day. Between 1999 and 2005 more than 6,000 women and girls were murdered, an average of 1,000 murdered women every year. The majority of the deaths result from violence within their household (Mexico, 2009). The rate of violence is not isolated to border towns. The Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas y Geografía (National Institute of Statistics and Geography/INEGI) reports that 67% of Mexican women aged 15 years of age and older have been victims of violence. At the same time, the political representation of Mexican women has increased over the years. The rate of Mexican women who hold national political positions is 35%, higher than most of its neighboring countries (Women, 2013). This thesis will focus on the representation of women at the federal level. Even though political representation numbers are significant compared to other nation states, Mexico ranks high in the Gender Inequality Index measured by the United Nations, signifying that Mexican women hold a poor position in their society. The relationship between the high incidence of violence against women and the number of elected female politicians is contradictory. This thesis will look at the effectiveness of Mexican female politicians in creating policies against violence and aims to answer these questions: 1) To what extent do women politicians follow party lines and to what extent do women politicians have autonomous agendas? 2) To what extent do women politicians get to participate in policy making and what role do quotas play in female participation? 3) Are Mexican female politicians writing and advocating effective legislation against violence? 4) What are some of the challenges and barriers in passing legislation against violence? I approach these questions using quantitative and qualitative methods through two case studies, data analysis, and narrative reports. I frame these questions around representation and critical mass theory. The first case study analyzes whether female PRI Senator Diva Gastelum represents her constituents through descriptive or substantives representation. The second case study analyzes the Ley General de Victimas (General Law for Victims/LGV), a piece of victim's assistance legislation and the role of female politicians.

H45ITLQ6,thesis,2015,Putbrese Benjamin L; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,Exploring design and policy options for orbital infrastructure projects,,,,,,"The space industry is currently at a significant inflection point. New economies are forming in low- Earth orbit (LEO), driven by miniaturization of technologies and the promise of lower launch costs, which should then allow many of these LEO systems to capitalize on designs incorporating smaller, shorter-lived spacecraft in highly-disaggregated constellations. Meanwhile, many spacecraft at geosynchronous orbit are continuing along a trend towards increasingly massive and longer-lasting satellites, and while they do represent some of the most exquisite, highest-performing satellites ever launched, some experts now feel that such trends are unsustainable and are beginning to place increasing strain on the underlying industry. To support current and future spacecraft, orbital infrastructures have been proposed as a means of providing on-orbit services to customer spacecraft and guiding space architectures towards more sustainable paradigms. In LEO, an infrastructure of communications and data relay spacecraft is envisioned as a means of aiding new and existing space enterprises in the areas of satellite connectivity and downlink capability. Meanwhile, an on-orbit servicing (OOS) infrastructure, located primarily in geosynchronous orbit, would provide services such as repair, rescue, refueling, and upgrading of customer spacecraft, in order to alleviate the identified space industry trends. Physics and cost modeling, as well as tradespace exploration, are used to identify optimal LEO infrastructure designs, while system dynamics modeling is used to assess the trends likely to occur in the overall space industry as OOS is incorporated into space architectures. The primary conclusion from the analysis of LEO infrastructure designs is that, when designing for global connectivity, there is an optimal design point between a small constellation of larger spacecraft and a very large constellation of small spacecraft, but this will also depend on the intended mission of the infrastructure and the number of customers expecting to be serviced. Then, for an OOS infrastructure, it is determined that relatively low costs and heavy incorporation of servicing capabilities into customer architectures are needed to ensure long-term sustainability of such a project. Finally, the policy implications for both infrastructure concepts are discussed, with a heavy focus on options for the funding and development regimes employed to implement the infrastructures, as well as the major political and legal implications expected to accompany these projects.",2015,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Exploring design and policy options for orbital infrastructure projects,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Limited gas capacity to the region has resulted in power reliability issues, particularly during severe winter weather when gas demand is high. The majority of proposed solutions have focused on increasing gas supply. However, demand response in the natural gas retail market is a potential alternative answer. To quantify the benefits of gas demand response regional and state level price elasticities of demand for natural gas must be known. In this thesis, the price elasticity of demand for natural gas in the U.S. was estimated for the period 2001 to 2014 at the national, regional and state levels for the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. Differences in demand estimates were observed when performed at the different aggregate data levels and sectors. However, not all the regional and state estimates obtained for each sector showed statistically significant differences from each other or the national level. The short-run regional estimates for New England were used in a simple demonstration of gas demand response to show how they could have been used to mitigate the effects of the 2014 cold snap on electricity generation. Prices were optimized such that they reduced gas demand from retail markets by the amount of fuel that generators were short while minimizing the total deadweight loss.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Regional estimates of the price elasticity of demand for natural gas in the United States,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HEQWXFSF,thesis,2012,"Hagerty, John Michael; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",The role of hydroelectric generation in electric power systems with large scale wind generation,,,,,,"An increasing awareness of the operational challenges created by intermittent generation of electricity from policy-mandated renewable resources, such as wind and solar, has led to increased scrutiny of the public policies that promote their growth and the regulatory system that maintains operation of a reliable and economically efficient power system. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that hydroelectric generation can provide significant benefits in power systems that have already significantly increased their power generation from intermittent renewable resources. A heuristic-based algorithm for optimizing the scheduling of hydroelectric power generation facilities was developed and integrated into the Low-Emissions Electricity Market Analysis (LEEMA) model to analyze the interaction of generation capacity from wind, thermal, and hydro resources in the economic dispatch of individual generation plants. The algorithm identifies the most costly periods of thermal production, considering fuel, startup and operation and maintenance costs, to determine the optimal schedule of hydro generation within its capacity constraints. The hydrothermal LEEMA model is run on the current Spanish electric power system to identify the impact of introducing hydro generation to a system, varying levels of flexibility in hydro generation, and increasing levels of wind generation. The analysis concludes that hydro generation can significantly reduce the impact of intermittent renewable generation, that the level of flexibility of hydro generation must be understood to determine how beneficial the hydro generation can be, and that hydro generation will delay the most significant impacts of increasing levels of wind generation.",2012,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2012 S.M.,Book Title: The role of hydroelectric generation in electric power systems with large scale wind generation,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HF8ITH8Q,thesis,2016,"Stefancik, John; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Demand forecasting using Monte Carlo Multi-Attribute Utility Theory,,,,,,"Volatile commodity prices over the past decade, environmentally-focused policy initiatives and new technology developments have forced manufacturers to consider the idea of substituting towards alternative materials in order meet both consumer and societal needs. The threat of substitution has created the need for manufacturing firms and other members of the supply chain to have the ability to understand the implications of substitution on future product market shares and overall raw material demand. This thesis demonstrates how Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) can be extended to the group level to forecast future market shares by applying a distribution to the attribute weights and using a Monte Carlo simulation to capture the choices made by a heterogeneous set of decision makers. Unlike established demand forecasting techniques, such as discrete choice models, this methodology requires only a few data points from a handful of expert interviews and allows for systematic changes of preferences over time. Furthermore, the Monte Carlo MAUT methodology utilizes both revealed preference and stated preference data by integrating the two data types through a response surface methodology. Two case studies on underground distribution and overhead distribution power cables are explored in order to illustrate how the Monte Carlo MAUT methodology can be successfully applied in cases where there are diverse product types, limited numbers of decisions makers and historical market share data is sparse. Each case study illustrates how Monte Carlo MAUT can, on a regional basis, provide key insights into the impacts of changing commodity prices, changing product attribute levels, varying new technology learning rates and changing consumer preferences over time. Furthermore, an example of how Monte Carlo MAUT can be utilized to help policymakers evaluate the advantages, disadvantages and overall impact of different policy schemes within an environmental context is provided. Private firms and public governments alike can utilize Monte Carlo MAUT to improve their understanding of how market shares are likely to change over time, and more importantly, the key decisions needed on each party's behalf in order to maximize societal well-being.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Demand forecasting using Monte Carlo Multi-Attribute Utility Theory,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated an evaluation method for a platform that used neural network agents of varying skill levels for the simple strategic game of Connect Four. We manipulated the presence, sequence, skill, and information display of Artificial Intelligence (AI) advice in a strategy game against another AI opponent that sometimes varied its skill to measure their effect on users’ performance. Human agent teams outperformed unaided subjects with those receiving the AI recommendations simultaneously achieving the best results. Although team performance was higher and subjects improved during game play, there was little evidence of learning from their AI advisors. AI reliability proved to be the greatest determiner of team performance with subjects retaining trust in higher skilled advisors even in varied environments. Those with higher numeracy demonstrated the highest ability to make use of AI advice including more detailed output formats including ranking of choices and probabilities. More reliable AI agents correlated to higher AI trust while higher self-confidence correlated to greater rejection of AI advice, greater confidence in success, but slightly lower performance. The value of these human agent teams depended on AI reliability, users’ ability to extract lessons from their advice, and users’ trust in that advice.

HGXQ2QXH,thesis,2015,"Kessler, Alaina Justine",A Framework for the Evaluation of Medication Errors in the Inpatient Setting,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/3073207639?pq-origsite=primo,"Over fifteen years ago, The Institute of Medicine's ""To Err is Human"" shed light on medication-related errors and their adverse effect on patient safety and quality . Medication use is ubiquitous in the United States. It is estimated that more than four out of five adults in the United States take at least one prescription or over-the-counter medication, and nearly one third of adults use at least five medications . Given these staggering medication use rates, it is not surprising that medication errors are some of the most prevalent types of errors seen across the healthcare continuum . These statistics can be applied to the hospital population demographic as well. Although the incidence based on prior literature is controversial, medication errors occurring in the inpatient hospital setting are estimated to range between 1.5% and 35% .Medication errors are costly, both with regards to increased healthcare expenditure as well as the adverse effects on society . A study looking at the cost of medication injuries reported in the states of Utah and Colorado concluded that adverse drug events comprised 32% of all reported events, and were the second most costly type, generating expenses of about $213,750,000/year . This was extrapolated to amount to nationwide costs approaching $5.2 billion/year . Errors not only result in increased hospital expenditure, but also lead to adverse societal costs ranging from disability and lost income to decreased worker productivity and reduced school attendance. Factoring in the cost of outpatient healthcare, lost wages, and lost household production to the prior figure. Thomas et al. estimated the national cost of adverse drug events to be $12.2 billion/year. Medication errors also result in dissatisfaction with respect to both the patient and the healthcare professional, and can lead to an overall loss of trust in the healthcare system .Data has shown that transitions of care are particularly high-risk times for medication errors as patients transition between inpatient and outpatient settings.""Interfaces of care"" [are] points of contact with patient care in which a caregiver is transferring, admitting, or discharging a patient to another floor in the hospital or to another health care organization. At the point of this transition, vulnerability has been created within the health care system. This occurs because essential data must accompany each patient and be assimilated by the new environment to ensure that care is not compromised.According to Bates et al., nearly half of preventable adverse drug events in hospitalized patients occur at the ordering stage. Upon admission to the hospital, it is good practice to have providers obtain an accurate list of medications a patient is taking at home to provide uninterrupted and appropriate treatment while the patient is hospitalized. An inaccurate list of outpatient medications may hinder the provider's ability to detect drug-related problems that can potentially cause admissions such as interactions, adverse drug events, or medication noncompliance.A preadmission medication list can be obtained from a variety of sources including patients themselves, family members or caregivers, pharmacy refill information, outpatient medical records, and previous admission records. There exists no all-inclusive electronic medical record; therefore all of these sources can contain inconsistencies. Medication errors from the medication list at admission can then carry through to the patient's new medication regimen at discharge, resulting in omission of drugs, drug duplication, incorrect dosages, and drug interactions.Patients undergoing the transition of care process face a variety of obstacles. Changes in a person's health status frequently cause them to be under the care of several prescribing providers, all of which are simultaneously adjusting the patient's medication list. It is important to consider the fact that hospitalized patients rely on clinical staff to administer medications at appropriate dosages and times, which can cause complacency during their inpatient stay. Upon discharge, patients and their families are suddenly expected to self-manage their medications in tandem with their recovery process.Undesirable side effects and the high cost of some medications are significant barriers that can also affect compliance. 6All of these factors can in some way result in variations between the medications a patient is prescribed, the medications a patient is actually taking, and the written list of medications found in the patient's medical record.",2015,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: A Framework for the Evaluation of Medication Errors in the Inpatient Setting ISBN: 9798382877655,,,,,"Health services administration; Medical errors; Medical records; Medicine; Pharmaceutical chemistry; Prescription Drugs; Public health; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In their aim to take advantage of data many large organizations are launching data management programs. In these attempts organizations recognize that taking full advantage of data requires enterprise wide changes in organizational aspects, business processes, and technology. The lack of recognition of this enterprise-wide scope haunts most data management programs. Research shows that most of these programs fail and get abandoned after long efforts and investments. This study aims to highlight critical reasons why these programs fail and a different approach to address the fundamental problems associated with the majority of these failures. It is important to be successful in the data efforts due to the fact that data driven businesses are gaining significant competitive edge. Data Centric Business Transformation Strategy (DCBT) is a holistic approach for the enterprise to transform into a data driven and agile entity. DCBT is also away to achieve better alignment in the enterprises. DCBT aims to achieve two goals to transform the organization; become a smarter organization by instilling continuous learning and improvement culture in all aspects of the business and achieve agility in enterprise-wide organizational learning and technology. To achieve these two goals, understanding the current state of the organization in the tree fundamental DCBT areas of organizational learning capacity, business processes and technology is essential to incrementally and continuously improve each one in concert. Required improvements should be introduced to smaller parts of the organization delivering the value of data. Strategically chosen pipeline of projects would allow the ramp up of the organization to a continuously learning and changing organization. In the age of digital economy, agile organizations can learn quicker from large amounts of data to have the competitive edge.

HHKXYLQS,thesis,2014,"Galván, José Alfredo Galván",Effects of College Internships on the Innovation Capability and Employability of the Mexican Workforce,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Effects_of_College_Internships_on_the_Innovation_Capability_and_Employability_of_the_Mexican_Workforce/6716153/1,"It is theorized that competition in the global market requires highly skilled human capital with different types and levels of skills, and with transferable skills. Internships are intended to nurture the skills and make students better professionals, better innovators, and more likely to get employment. In this thesis I evaluated these claims by examining the effect of the skills developed by internships on the professional performance, innovation capability and employability of Mexican students. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate both the mandatory internship program in its ability to improve employability and to test some of the educational theories of workforce improvement and of what skills contribute to workers’ innovation capacity. Internships prepare students for the workplace by giving them opportunities to develop relevant skills. The Committee on the Assessment of 21st Century Skills of the U.S. National Research Council (NRC), identified three categories of workplace skills enabling individuals to face 21st Century challenges: cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal skills. I tested the relevance of these skills to interns’ professional performance using intern evaluation data on interns working at a multinational enterprise in the global steel industry, Ternium Mexico. A general model of internship outcomes was used to predict Main task and learning performance internship outcomes, and ordered logistic regression was used to predict Overall internship performance. The results confirmed that (1) cognitive intelligence or technical skills are necessary but not sufficient for success in executing professional tasks and (2) certain interpersonal and intrapersonal skills were also significantly associated with better professional performance as an intern. vi The ability to innovate is one of the most important and desired meta-skills for individuals, firms, and economies. It is believed that nurturing students’ innovation capability will improve their employability and their ability to deal with a rapidly changing future. A recent conceptual model of Individuals’ Innovation Capability, the D4 innovation model, has four stages: defining, discovering, developing, and demonstrating. Using the same internship evaluation data set, I determined whether the four D innovation skills: defining, discovering, developing and deploying skills, predicted Individuals’ Innovation Capability. The study confirmed that three of the innovation skills, discovery, developing and deploying, increase Individuals’ Innovation Capability. The foundation skills of oral communication and ability to self-update, and the professional competencies of establishing priorities and explicit knowledge also foster individual innovation capability. Internships have often been required for graduation by institutions of higher education because internships are perceived to help students increase their employability as well as provide educational value. I conducted statistical analyses to test whether students’ performance as interns and the number of internships they completed are predictive of their Probability of Employment, controlling for various labor-market conditions. The study analyzed the records of graduates at a private Mexican university who had completed undergraduate degrees as well as mandatory internships. A logistic regression model for job placement four months following graduation included: individual factors, personal circumstances, external conditions, and interactions with external conditions. This study revealed that the performance as an intern played an important role on employment and that employability depended on the interaction of a vii graduate’s personal assets, his/her family connections, and whether or not the labor market was contracting. This thesis is an empirical exploration of educational theory concerning the value of internships and also the skills that internships should foster. Since educational policy is frequently driven by theory, such validation is a potentially useful reality-check for policy makers. This work can inform educational policy and provide the underpinnings for shaping initiatives that benefit students, firms and the region.",8/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716153.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HJWEAI95,thesis,2014,"Craig, Michael T.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Reducing the contribution of the power sector to ground-level ozone pollution: an assessment of time-differentiated pricing of nitrogen oxide emissions,,,,,,"Nitrogen oxide (NOx) is a prevalent air pollutant across the United States and a requisite precursor for tropospheric (ground-level) ozone formation. Both pollutants significantly impact human health and welfare, so National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have been established for each. As of 2013, over 100 million people in the U.S. lived in areas with ozone concentrations above the NAAQS. NOx emissions from the power sector, roughly 12% of total NOx emissions, are and will be significant contributors to ozone concentrations in the U.S. As such, states have reduced peak ozone concentrations through technology-based standards and cap-and-trade programs on NOx emissions from the power sector. These policies have largely treated NOx emissions uniformly. But marginal damages from NOx emissions are greatest on hot sunny days when meteorological conditions favor high ozone formation rates and, consequently, peak ozone concentrations. This thesis informs what type of policy is the most efficient for reducing peak ozone concentrations on high ozone days by assessing the cost-effectiveness of three policies for reducing NOx emissions on high ozone days. Emissions and costs under a relatively-novel differentiated policy, time-differentiated pricing, are compared for the first time to two currently-implemented undifferentiated policies, cap-and-trade and technology-based standards. Two power systems are studied, Texas and the Mid-Atlantic. A unique two-phase model is developed to capture the short- (re-dispatching) and long-term (control technology installation) effects of pricing schemes on power plants. The two-phase model dispatches generators with a unit commitment model, which, unlike past studies, captures real-world operational constraints of generators that may strongly influence emissions and costs under time-differentiated pricing. Technology-based standards are simulated via Monte Carlo analysis to capture the uncertain rule-making process. For reducing NOx emissions on high ozone days in both power systems, time-differentiated pricing is shown to be the most cost-effective policy with regards to producer and consumer costs. Most emissions reductions are due to substitution of gas- for coal-fired generators, as control technology installations are only observed at very high time-differentiated prices. For reducing summer-wide NOx emissions, undifferentiated pricing is the most cost-effective. In a minority of allocations, technology-based standards also achieve more cost-effective summer-wide reductions than time-differentiated pricing, but such allocations cannot be guaranteed ex ante. These results suggest that time-differentiated pricing is the most efficient policy for reducing peak ozone concentrations, depending on ozone formation rates.",2014,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,Reducing the contribution of the power sector to ground-level ozone pollution,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Reducing the contribution of the power sector to ground-level ozone pollution : an assessment of time-differentiated pricing of nitrogen oxide emissions,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HKUJSALF,thesis,2018,"Davidson, Michael; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Creating markets for wind electricity in China: case studies in energy policy and regulation,,,,,,"China's rapid economic growth -- largely industrial, energy-intensive, and reliant on coal -- has generated environmental, public health, and governance challenges. While China now leads the world in renewable energy deployment, curtailment (waste) of wind and solar is high and increasing, generating much discussion on the relative contributions of technical inflexibilities and incomplete institutional reforms on integration outcomes. These integration challenges directly affect China's ability to meet long-term environmental and economic objectives. A second, related challenge emerges from how wind integration interacts with China's reinvigoration in 2015 of a three-decade-old process to establish competitive electricity markets. A ""standard liberalization prescription"" for electricity markets exists internationally, though Chinese policy-makers ignore or under-emphasize many of its elements in current reforms, and some scholars question its general viability in emerging economies. This dissertation examines these interrelated phenomena by analyzing the contributions of diverse causes of wind curtailment, assessing whether current experiments will lead to efficient and politically viable electricity markets, and offering prescriptions on when and how to use markets to address renewable energy integration challenges. To examine fundamentals of the technical system and the impacts of institutional incentives on system outcomes, this dissertation develops a multi-method approach that iterates between engineering models and qualitative case studies of the system operation decision-making process (Chapter 2). These are necessary to capture, respectively, production functions inclusive of physical constraints and costs, and incentive structures of formally specified as well as de facto institutions. Interviews conducted over 2013-2016 with key stakeholders in four case provinces/regions with significant wind development inform tracing of the processes of grid and market operations (Chapter 3). A mixed-integer unit commitment and economic dispatch optimization is formulated and, based on the case studies, further tailored by adding several institutions of China's partially-liberalized system (Chapter 4). The model generates a reference picture of three of the systems as well as quantitative contributions of relevant institutions (Chapter 5). Insights from qualitative and quantitative approaches are combined iteratively for more parsimonious findings (Chapter 6). This dissertation disentangles the causes of curtailment, focusing on the directional and relative contributions of institutions, technical issues, and potential interactive effects. Wind curtailment is found to be closely tied to engineering constraints, such as must-run combined heat and power (CHP) in northern winters. However, institutional causes -- inflexibilities in both scheduling and inter-provincial trading -- have a larger impact on curtailment rates. Technical parameters that are currently set administratively at the provincial level (e.g., coal generator minimum outputs) are a third and important leading cause under certain conditions. To assess the impact of China's broader reform of the electricity system on wind curtailment, this dissertation examines in detail ""marketizing"" experiments. In principle, spot markets for electricity naturally prioritize wind, with near zero marginal cost, thereby contributing to low curtailment. However, China has not yet created a spot market and this dissertation finds that its implementation of other electricity markets in practice operates far from ideal. Market designs follow a similar pattern of relying on dual-track prices and out-of-market parameters, which, in the case of electricity, leave several key institutional causes of inefficiency and curtailment untouched. Compared to other sectors with successful marketization occurring when markets ""grow out of the plan,"" all of the major electricity experiments examined show deficiencies in their ability to transition to an efficient market and to cost-effectively integrate wind energy. Although China's setting is institutionally very different, results support implementation of many elements of standard electricity market prescriptions: prioritize regional (inter-provincial) markets, eliminate conflicts of interest in dispatch, and create a consistent central policy on ""transition costs"" of reducing central planning. Important for China, though overlooked in standard prescriptions: markets are enhanced by clarifying the connection between dispatch and exchange settlement. As is well established, power system efficiency is expected to achieve greatest gains with a short-term merit order dispatch and primarily financial market instruments, though some workable near-term deviations for the Chinese context are proposed. Ambiguous property rights related to generation plans have helped accelerate reforms, but also delay more effective markets from evolving. China shares similarities with the large class of emerging economies undergoing electricity market restructuring, for which this suggests research efforts should disaggregate planning from scheduling institutions, analyze the range of legacy sub-national trade barriers, and prioritize finding ""second-best"" liberalization options fit to country context in the form and order of institutional reforms.",2018,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,Creating markets for wind electricity in China,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2018 Ph.D.,Book Title: Creating markets for wind electricity in China : case studies in energy policy and regulation,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HLMG8IGJ,thesis,2016,"Abrahams, Leslie",Quantitative Modeling Under Uncertainty to Inform Effective Energy and Environmental Policies,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Quantitative_Modeling_Under_Uncertainty_to_Inform_Effective_Energy_and_Environmental_Policies/6721223/1,"Natural gas production in the United States has increased significantly over the past decade. This is largely due to advancements in hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, and seismic monitoring capabilities that have enabled extraction of natural gas from shale resources to be economically viable. While natural gas is an important global energy resource and may result in fewer emissions than coal for electricity generation, it is important to recognize that extraction of natural gas has the potential to cause local and regional environmental damages. Successfully managing these risks is critical in order to ensure natural gas consumption has a net positive environmental footprint. The second and third chapters of this dissertation use quantitative modeling to assess how policies can address and mitigate potential environmental impacts in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, this work focuses on minimizing incremental fragmentation in critical core forest ecosystems resulting from natural gas infrastructure and on managing wastewater byproducts from natural gas extraction. The second chapter finds that in the case study of a core forest region in Bradford County, Pennsylvania, the number of core patches of forest, an indicator of fragmentation, could as much as double throughout the life time of the Marcellus Shale play (from 80 to 160 core patches) without any regulatory intervention. However, through unitization and collaborative planning, and by designating that gathering pipelines must follow the route of pre-existing roads in forests whenever possible, natural gas infrastructure can be developed in a manner that would both prevent incremental fragmentation from occurring and reduce pipeline construction costs for operators as a result of reduced infrastructure redundancies. The third chapter finds that approximately 1.3 million gallons of wastewater, called produced water, are generated by each well. Across Pennsylvania, 67% of the time Class II disposal is the least cost option, 25% of the time CWT is the least cost option, and 8% of the time on-site treatment is the least cost option. The corresponding average costs are $5.80/bbl ($0.015/Mcf), $7.80/bbl ($0.020/Mcf), and $8.40/bbl ($0.021/Mcf), respectively. In addition to cost, however, there are several technical, ecological, regulatory, and logistical issues that also affect the relative feasibility of these three produced water management strategies. If regulators could capture producers willingness to pay to dispose of water rather than treat the water, that money could be invested in treating other water quality issues in Pennsylvania such as coal mine drainage, which can be treated for $0.064/bbl on average, or agricultural runoff, which could be prevented at an average cost of $0.08/bbl. The last two chapters in this dissertation explore how quantitative modeling can inform policy making on a national and global scale. Chapter 4 does this by characterizing the life cycle greenhouse gas impact of United States natural gas exports. This study finds that mean landed (pre-combustion) life cycle GHGs for exported U.S. LNG after regasification at the importing country were found to be 37 g CO2-equiv/MJ with a range of 27 to 50. The net global impact of these emissions depends on the global warming potential time scale, methane leakage rate, end use, and the fuel it displaces. On a 100 year time scale, life cycle emissions from exported LNG were found on average to be 655 g CO2-equiv/kWh for electricity generation, a 45% reduction over life cycle emissions from coal consumption. However, because of the spatial shift in emissions generation, although there is a global GHG benefit to US natural gas exports, the United States should consider the implications of this given that emissions calculations are based on CO2-eq emitted within a country’s borders rather than based on the net global impact of those emissions. The fifth chapter continues to explore international trade policy by focusing on the global crude trade as a case study. This chapter considers how shifting trade patterns can influence global costs and greenhouse gas emissions using a linear optimization model. The baseline 2014 crude trade system had a global cost of $3T and resulted in 16.5 Gt of CO2. Minimizing by cost would save $6T and increase emissions by 4 Gt CO2, while minimizing by emissions would increase cost by $0.5T and decrease emissions by 5.4 Gt. This chapter then explores the interaction between climate policies including carbon accounting methods, a designated global carbon cap, and unilateral country specific emissions allocations. There is a 40% higher allowable consumption under a strict global carbon cap without country-specific emissions allocations (1100 Mmt) than with country-specific emissions caps (770 Mmt). These results illustrate cooperative international climate policy could be more cost-effective in mitigating carbon emissions than countries acting individually.",4/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721223.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HQDHVJZN,thesis,2009,"Nadeau, Marie-Claude; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Evaluating manufacturing flexibility driven by learning,,,,,,"A defining feature of modern industry is operating in a context of nearly continuous technological change. Nevertheless, industrial decision-makers must select technologies and implement production strategies even in the face of known-to-be-incomplete information and environmental uncertainties. Further complicating the picture, the performance, including the economic performance, associated with novel technology options is likely to change over time. To address this problem, two approaches are possible: improving the quality of currently available information, and implementing flexible production strategies. The present work characterizes how the former approach impacts the valuation of the latter. First, a dynamic approach integrating learning curves and process-based cost modeling is used to examine learning in manufacturing, thus allowing decision-makers to incorporate information about expected technology evolution into their economic evaluations of technology. The approach is applied to an automotive assembly process, and quantifies the cost impacts of learning improvements in manufacturing time, downtime, and defect rates. Analysis can be used to focus learning activities on primary learning operational drivers, and to forecast cost improvements for a novel process. Flexibility strategies are often focused on capital-intensive processes, while labor-intensive processes are thought to be inherently flexible. The existence of learning effects, however, implies that labor flexibility has costs and, potentially, benefits in the context of uncertainty. A simple automotive assembly case is used here to illustrate the impact of manufacturing learning on labor flexibility and its economic value. A framework using cash-flow and decision tree models is introduced to quantify the costs and benefits of acquiring worker flexibility, and improve information available for strategic decision-making in labor-intensive systems. The front-end characterization of the technical drivers of learning provides insight into how the value of flexibility can be impacted at the operational level, enabling managers to prioritize improvements and minimize the costs of flexibility.",2009,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2009 S.M.,Book Title: Evaluating manufacturing flexibility driven by learning,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the re-introduction of democracy and open society in the post-socialist region, educational borrowing has become one of the key strategies in the rebuilding and reformation of post-socialist education systems. While the process of educational borrowing is not a new phenomenon, the role of local and national governments' involvement has changed as multiple agencies, ranging from international NGOs to semi-governmental organizations (such as the World Bank), have become involved in the development and implementation of educational reform processes. The provision of ECE has become a critical catalyst to promote stability within transitioning countries, as funding for these programs provides an important site for foreign intervention due to the intrinsic value offered to parents, along with the perceived neutrality of ECE. The study highlights tensions present between local practitioners responsible for implementation of the transferred program and foundation personnel responsible for maintenance and the future of the foundation; and illustrates difficulties in maintaining enthusiasm and impetus for a developed program when the goals of the developing foundation have changed over time. Specifically, the study focused on four main findings: (1) donors choose specific programs and practices that support the mission of the organization; (2) specific forms of transfer are involved in the borrowing process that serve as a filter to the information and practices transferred; (3) there is a need for more genuine local involvement in the early stages of program replication; (4) the transfer of a program is not a linear process; instead it becomes enmeshed in the complex social interactions of individuals and organizations involved in the transfer process.",2010,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,Policy transfer in the post-socialist region,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Policy transfer in the post-socialist region: The Open Society Institute and the Step By Step initiative ISBN: 9781124253954,,,,,Early childhood education; Education (Early childhood),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HSCYXV6I,thesis,2013,"Graham, Tracey E.","Jamaican migration to Cuba, 1912--1940",,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1346016927?pq-origsite=primo,"This study helps to broaden a growing body of literature by examining the growth of an urban Jamaican community in the southeastern port of Santiago de Cuba, Cuba. Background: When the British colony of Jamaica abolished slavery in 1838, the upper classes attempted to tie free workers to sugar plantations; ex–slaves attempted to move away from the estates as soon as possible. Despite an increase in internal migration after abolition, the majority of the black population remained in rural areas, and dedicated their labor to the land. The Jamaican elite successfully argued for the introduction of contract laborers from Asia as a replacement for the slavery system. It brought the planters some limited economic success as export crops—particularly sugar—had the chance to rebound, but planters used immigrants to drive down wages. Increasing population pressure on the land, a series of natural disasters, few economic opportunities, and ineligibility for political participation prompted Jamaicans to look outside of their homeland for socioeconomic improvement by the late 1800s. Travelers emigrated in significant numbers to Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua with the hope of earning higher wages, sending remittances to family members, and returning home with enough money to live independently. As work on the Panama Canal ended by the 1910s, Jamaicans turned their sights back to the Caribbean. During the second half of the 19th century, Cuba was one of Spain's two remaining Caribbean colonies despite attempting several wars of independence. At the end of the final effort in 1898, the United States intervened against the metropolis; the two powers reached an agreement giving possession of Cuba to the US, who would help to establish political order and assist the islanders in ruling themselves. US investment in Cuban industry, especially in sugar, allowed foreigners to purchase enormous tracts of land and to influence the restructuring of the island's political, social, and economic landscape. The seasonal sugar cane harvest attracted foreign workers from Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean seeking better wages than what they could find at home; between 1912 and 1920, thousands of British West Indians traveled to Cuba to labor in the agricultural industry or to occupy niches in the service industry. However, Cubans scrutinized and discriminated against them for being black, for being foreign, for driving down wages, or some combination thereof. Though Cubans claimed to live in a color-blind society, racial discrimination persisted and the white elite supported a policy of “whitening” the island through selective immigration from Spain and miscegenation; these racial and cultural prejudices were particularly divisive given that a significant percentage of Cubans were of African descent. Furthermore, the general population was frustrated by the lack of Cuban sovereignty and saw foreign workers as complicit in the US intervention. As a result, calls for nationalism tended to veer into xenophobia and racism during economic downturns in the early 1920s and 1930s. Methods/Sources: Due to limited access to archival sources in Cuba, the bulk of the data is from the British National Archives: the consular reports summarized political and social upheaval in Cuba, collected publications from the Cuban government, and gave a perspective of the migration from the viewpoint of the British government. Similar information came from the U.S. National Archives at College Park, Maryland. The provincial archive of Santiago de Cuba provided information on migrant activities: marriage and citizenship documents; and social, cultural, and political organizations. It also yielded the Cuban government's responses to West Indian immigration. Correspondence between colonial officials and international organizations came from the Jamaican National Archives; the Sir Arthur Lewis Institute for Social and Economic Studies at the University of the West Indies, Mona, held interviews of Jamaicans who lived during the period under study. Cuban and Jamaican newspaper reports detailed economic and political conditions in the two islands from journalists' investigations, letters from migrants, and governmental decrees. Findings: I relate how different groups in Cuba reacted to Jamaican migration: the support for and against it, how this support changed over time, and how it differed by geography. I also attempt to give a fuller description of who these migrants were. I discuss their relationships with other West Indians and Cubans, their marriages, and the paths that they took to Cuban citizenship. How gender influenced and differentiated Jamaicans' experiences when they went abroad—how they were perceived and treated, and how they fared—receives special attention. The work concludes by examining the reaction of the British officials who represented British West Indians in Cuba. It also puts the migration into a broader context by examining black British subjects who traveled to other parts of Latin America and the Caribbean during this era.

While the earliest programs of its kind were initiated about a decade ago, we still lack empirical evidence on its effectiveness. Using the detailed dataset of the gap-funding program at MIT, the Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, I observe two mechanisms that gap-funding program can facilitate academic commercialization. First, by providing research funding that allows academic freedom of problem selection and mode of disclosure, gap-funding program attracts applications from junior faculty members with commercialization interests. Second, providing research funding for prototype development and networking opportunities with industry practitioners increases the likelihood that an academic invention results in start-up founding. Moreover, its positive impact is larger for inventions without intellectual property rights protection, partly because of the reduced level of uncertainty after prototype development. However, awarding gap-funding does not increase the likelihood of technology licensing to incumbent firms. Together, I argue that gap-funding program can be a useful policy toolkit for regional economic development by fostering academic entrepreneurship.",2013,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Bridging the innovation gap through funding,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2013 S.M.,Book Title: Bridging the innovation gap through funding : the case of MIT Deshpande Center,,,,,Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation (Massachusetts Institute of Technology),,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I2PL6XXH,thesis,2012,"Ramesh, C.","Autopsy Study of Unnatural Deaths of Teenagers and Adolescents in the Age Group of 13-21 Years Conducted at Kims Hospital, Bengaluru",,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2848394766?pq-origsite=primo,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Unnatural deaths are the leading killer of today’s teenaged and adolescent generation, as the patterns have changed from infections towards social etiologies during the last decades. The unnatural deaths may be due to unintentional or intentional injuries. Unintentional injuries are mainly accidents and homicides. Intentional injuries are mainly suicides. During the last decade, unnatural deaths were more common than natural deaths (disease) among teenagers and adolescents.Many cultural and socio-economic factors of a country are usually related to the causation of unnatural deaths. The aim of this study is to investigate teenager and adolescents deaths due to unnatural cause in the city of Bangalore. Unintentional injury and suicide are leading causes of death among teenagers/adolescents and reducing this is an important health priority as the people of this age is characterized by hope, drive and ambition. This particular section of the society is very much needed for the building the nation in future. There is limited data on teenager and adolescent mortality particularly from developing countries with unreliable death registration systems. This calls for the use of other sources of data to ascertain cause of teenager and adolescent mortality. Police investigation records provide a valuable source of information on the events leading to the death of an individual, and analysis of these records along with postmortem analysis may help us understanding of the causal pathway, elucidate potential areas for intervention and socio-political system to investigate and develop preventive measures.MATERIALS AND METHODS:Department of Forensic Medicine, KIMS Hospital and Research Centre, Bengaluru is a post graduate Institute which conducts autopsies of all sudden, suspicious, unnatural deaths which occur in and around south Bangalore. The present study is a descriptive study of unnatural death cases of teenagers and adolescents of the age group 13-21 years which were autopsied at KIMS hospital, Bengaluru for a period of 2 years from June 2009 to May 2011.RESULTS:During this period 918 cases were brought for post mortem examination out of which 804 (87.6%) deaths were due unnatural causes. Out of 804 cases of unnatural deaths 114 deaths were of teenagers and adolescents of the age group 13 to 21 years. During the two years of study period 918 cases were autopsied out of which 804 cases (87.6%) cases were unnatural deaths and 114 cases (12.4%) were of natural deaths. Out of 804 cases of unnatural deaths, 114 cases (14.2%) were of teenagers and adolescents belonging to the age group 13 to 21 years. Among 114 cases of unnatural deaths in teenagers and adolescents 20 (17.5%) were in the age group of 13-15 years, 33 (30%) were of 16-18 years and 61(53.5%) cases were of the age group 19-21 years. Out of 114 cases 55 (48.2%) were males and 59 (51.8%) were females. In this study maximum number of unnatural deaths in teenagers and adolescents occurred during night times i.e., 70 cases (61%), followed by 20 cases (18%) during morning, 15 cases (13%) during evening and 9 cases (8%) during afternoon. Out of 114 cases unnatural deaths among teenagers and adolescents, maximum number of victims were from social class III i.e., 51 cases and least among social class V i.e., 10 cases. In this study among 114 deaths 91(79.8%) cases were intentional and 23 (20.2%) cases were unintentional. Among intentional deaths 2 cases (2.2%) were homicidal and 89 cases (97.8%) were suicidal in nature. In case of homicidal deaths both were male victims, while in case of suicidal deaths 36 victims were males and 53 were females. Hanging is the most preferred method used to commit suicide with 68 cases ((76.4%) out of 89 cases, followed by 10 cases (11.2%) of poisoning, 7 cases (7.9%) of burns and 4 cases (4.5%) of fall from height. The cause for committing suicide with 28 cases (31.5%) were due to Insanity/Mental illness, 25 cases (28.1%) were due to family problems, 14 (15.7%) due to illness, 9 (10.1%) each due to love affairs and failure in examination. 3 cases (3.4%) due to dowry related and 1 case (1.1%) due to drug addiction/abuse. Out of 23 cases of unintentional deaths 18 cases (78.3%) were due to road traffic accidents, 2 cases (8.7%) were due to electrocution and 3 cases (13%) were due to drowning. Out of 23 cases of unintentional deaths 20 (87%) were males and 3 (13%) were females. All the deaths due accidents were of unnatural. No accidents due to natural calamities were reported during this study. Out of 18 cases of Road traffic accidents 14 victims were males and 4 victims were females.CONCLUSIONS:Teenage and adolescence are important stages in development. Death among them is the important reasons of potential life loss to the family and society and to some extent it reflects the socio-economic and medical health care status at national and regional levels. It is essential to establish the protective system, enhance the education level among teenagers and adolescents to prevent them from unnatural deaths. So all possible steps of measures should be carried out by the concerned authorities to prevent those unnatural deaths among teenagers and adolescents to improve the situation.",2012,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Autopsy Study of Unnatural Deaths of Teenagers and Adolescents in the Age Group of 13-21 Years Conducted at Kims Hospital, Bengaluru ISBN: 9798380032971",,,,,Clinical psychology; Criminal investigation; Developing countries; Economics; Firearms; Gangs; Law enforcement; Medicine; Mortality; Poisoning; Psychology; Socioeconomic Factors; Sociology; Teenagers; Violence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I553TNI6,thesis,2014,"Frank, David Elliot",Waste Cooking Oil-to-Biodiesel Conversion for Institutional Vehicular Applications,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1545897931?pq-origsite=primo,"Biodiesel is a renewable, sustainable, clean-burning biogenic fuel that can serve as a substitute for conventional ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD). Biodiesel is comprised of mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids and is produced via transesterification, whereby glycerin is separated from the fatty acid component of either an oil or fat. The full process yields the fatty acid methyl ester (biodiesel fuel) and glycerin, an economically valuable by-product. As part of a United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Climate Showcase Communities Grant to Monroe County, New York and Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), the Golisano Institute for Sustainability (GIS) was engaged to develop a closed-loop biodiesel production process system using the food service waste cooking oil stocks. Because the waste oil feedstock supply and fuel demand are internal within the institution, the system dynamics, economic feasibility, and environmental benefits versus the incumbent ultra-low sulfur diesel can be effectively quantified. Along with establishing quantitative metrics associated with quality of the fuel itself, the main goal of this part of a broader research program included utilizing the biodiesel fuel for campus vehicular applications. Ultimately, developing a robust waste-to-energy process within the system boundaries of the institution is the desired outcome, along with economic valuation, emissions testing, fuel quality metrics and standardization, life cycle assessment, and energy return on investment for the university's stakeholders. Through the execution of this project, two successful biodiesel batches were produced which met American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) quality standards for vehicle use. Lower heating value (LHV) measurement demonstrated comparable embodied energy content to earlier published data. In addition, cloud point measurements were taken to understand the performance of the fuel in cold weather conditions, and these metrics were also consistent with published data for biodiesel fuels. Through direct measurements of exhaust gas composition, overall reductions in greenhouse gas emissions were observed in two test vehicles. However, consistent with published data, there is evidence that emissions of nitrous oxides (NOx) may be higher with a 20% biodiesel blend (B20), depending on the specific vehicle and the type of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve technology employed. According to a life cycle assessment conducted on the closed-loop biodiesel production process, the cumulative energy demand (CED) was 752 MJ/100 km and the global warming potential (GWP) was 80.6 kg CO2-eq./100 km. Crude oil-based diesel contributes the most to the energy and environmental impact to the total combustion CED and GWP of a B20 fuel mixture, while the methanol component contributes the greatest energy and environmental impact to just the biodiesel component. The energy return on investment (EROI) was determined to vary depending on specific waste oil properties and processing conditions, with a value of 4.16 determined to be most representative of the developed conversion process. This demonstrates that waste cooking oil biodiesel production at RIT is net energy positive, and thus can reasonably contribute to the University's renewable energy and GHG emissions reduction goals. The closed-loop biodiesel process also presented a compelling economic case, with a total computed cost of $3.35/gallon (including a conservative estimate for production labor) well lower than the reported national prices of B100 at retail market.",2014,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Waste Cooking Oil-to-Biodiesel Conversion for Institutional Vehicular Applications ISBN: 9781303940347,,,,,Environmental sciences; Renewable energy sources; Sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Refined spatial and temporal data are needed to accurately model how the dynamics of human travel contribute to epidemiological patterns of disease as well as access to healthcare resources. Here, I address a number of key issues related to modeling human mobility patterns and applications for understanding the spatial spread of infectious diseases and geographic access to public health resources. Using large sources of behavioral data anonymously collected from mobile phones within two African countries, I first analyze the utility of these data to quantify human mobility patterns as well as the usefulness of common modeling frameworks. Then I compare these data to two more common sources of human travel data: the national census and a comprehensive travel survey. Next, I use these data to assess the impact of human travel on the movement of malaria parasites. The final component of my thesis focuses on the utility of this data source to generally understand the role of geographic isolation on travel patterns to better understand the disparity between areas with various levels of access to public resources and the uptake of preventative healthcare such as immunizations and antenatal care.",5/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721214.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to analyzing historic epidemic data, computational simulation of epidemic propagation processes and disease control strategies can help us understand in the laboratory the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics. Consequently, the public can be better prepared and the government can control future epidemic outbreaks more effectively. Epidemic propagation simulation systems which use high performance computing technology have been proposed and developed to understand disease propagation processes. The proposed systems, however, do not strongly support two important steps in modeling disease propagation: run-time infection situation assessment and intervention adjustment. In addition, while these simulation systems are computationally efficient in their simulations, most of them have limited capabilities in terms of modeling interventions in realistic scenarios. In this dissertation, we focus on building a modeling and simulation environment for epidemic propagation and propagation control strategy. The objective of this work is to design such a modeling environment supporting the previously missing functions while still performing well in terms of the expected features such as modeling fidelity, computational efficiency, modeling capability, etc. Our proposed methodologies to build such a modeling environment are: 1) a loosely coupled and co-evolving model for disease propagation, situation assessment, and propagation control strategy, and 2) using relational databases to assess situations and simulate control strategies. Our motivations are: 1) a loosely coupled and co-evolving model allows us to design modules for each function separately and reduces design complexity for the modeling system, and 2) simulating propagation control strategies using relational databases improves the modeling capability and the human productivity of using this environment. To evaluate our proposed methodologies, we have designed and built a loosely coupled and database supported epidemic modeling and simulation environment. With detailed experimental results and realistic case studies, we demonstrate that our modeling environment provides the missing functions and greatly enhances many expected features, such as modeling capability, without significantly sacrificing computational efficiency and scalability.",2013,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: A Database Supported Modeling Environment for Pandemic Planning and Course of Action Analysis ISBN: 9781303788000,,,,,Computer science; Operations research; Public health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I86BUGM9,thesis,2015,"Oh, Suzie",Education and Challenges for North Korean Defector Youth in South Korea,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1696750651?pq-origsite=primo,"Despite the South Korean government’s North Korean defector resettlement support system that aims to provide for a smooth transition into a new society, North Korean defectors fail to successfully adjust and thrive in their new environment. High unemployment rates and high drop out rate from school among North Korean defectors are only a few indicators that attest to social maladjustment. This thesis will look into the unique challenges North Korean defector youth face in the South Korean education system and how the South Korean government’s assistance lacks to provide the support North Korean youth need in this critical period of social transition and educational development. After establishing that existing scholarship overwhelmingly points to mental/psychological and sociocultural factors stemming from past experiences as having a significant effect on defectors’ adjustment to South Korea, this thesis will the examine the experiences and the challenges that defector youth face within the South Korean education system. By uncovering the deficiencies in South Korean resettlement policies in addressing these psychological and sociocultural factors within education and support for defector youth, this thesis will argue that despite the varying levels of traumatic experiences that affect the intellectual and social development of North Korean defector youth before and after coming to South Korea, south Korean laws and policies lack a centralized education system, long-term support, expertise and support for specialized programs show the government’s inability to address the challenges of that defector youth face adjusting to South Korean society. Data for this study comes largely from statistics from the South Korean government and organizations such as the Korean Educational Development Institute, Ministry of Unification and the North Korean Refugees Foundation, previous academic studies on the experiences of North Korean defectors, and documentation of South Korean resettlement policy and laws. Additional insight and narratives from the researcher’s informal interviews conducted with four defector students will be used to further illustrate the difficult reality defector youth face. These students attend the Jangdaehyun School, an alternative Christian boarding school for North Korean defectors located in Busan, South Korea. The principal of the school, Professor Changho Lim was also interviewed for additional insight on the need and significance of alternative education for defector youth.

However, the security techniques that are well-suited to the traditional cloud computing model do not adequately protect against the increased cyber-physical and privacy risk element of the Internet of Things (IoT). Off-premise code execution in the hybrid cloud computingmodel must be resilient against both malicious software and an adversary with physical access. Moreover, in the absence of user-controlled and remotely verifiable data protectionmechanisms, individuals must implicitly rely upon application service providers — including the full software stack responsible for the deployment, management, and monitoring of cloud workloads — for the handling of personal data. This work develops the concept of fog mediation — a fog computing systems design pattern, derived exclusively from the physical microstructure of commodity CPUs, for generating user-controlled cryptographic key material and, thereupon, mediating the usability, security, and privacy requirements of security-sensitive Internet of Things applications.The tamper-evident key generation properties of an isolated execution environment enable security-sensitive application logic and data to move freely between on-premise and offpremise computing resources. Fog mediation maps the variegated device capabilities of the IoT to a manageable set of mandatory protections and discretionary controls that accord with the application requirements and the data handling preferences of individuals. How we regulate the use of data in the context of IoT has significant implications forindividual rights with regards to personal data and notions of privacy and cybersecurity in an increasingly connected society. The policy analysis focuses on laws, standards, and regulations relevant to the use of IoT in the United States. In particular, this work investigates policy measures that could be adopted through the joint efforts of U.S. federal and state regulation, private sector self-regulation, transnational technical standards organizations, and consumer-oriented non-governmental organizations.",12/18/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:37,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/11337008.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/DSSHZ9QA/Owusu - 2019 - Fog Mediated Security in the Internet of Things.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hydrogen has emerged as a promising part of a portfolio of solutions, with the potential to offer a clean alternative for various sectors such as transportation, industry, and power generation. However, integrating hydrogen into the existing energy infrastructure presents challenges, including issues of cost competitiveness, achieving clean production with very low leakage, public understanding and acceptance, and ensuring a reliable supply chain. All of these challenges underscore the complexities involved in the deployment and adoption of a transformative technology within energy and infrastructure systems. Currently dozens of pilot projects, designed to jumpstart the production and use of hydrogen and demonstrate its large-scale application in the energy mix, are being planned and developed across the United States. While achieving, or at least providing a pathway to, cost competitiveness is a key market-based objective for these projects, identifying and overcoming non-economic challenges will be at least as important to ensuring the successful development of a hydrogen market. This dissertation contributes to the understanding of barriers and opportunities associated with the widespread use of hydrogen technologies in the United States today. It applies both qualitative and quantitative methods to (1) evaluate barriers identified across published national hydrogen roadmaps, as well as stakeholder views on non-economic barriers the hydrogen market is currently facing in the US; (2) gain a more nuanced understanding of the public perception of hydrogen and hydrogen hubs; and (3) provide a comparative lifecycle assessment of the envi?ronmental impacts that various regions of the US will face in establishing hydrogen production facilities. The results advance the understanding of current opportunities in the integration of hydrogen into the clean energy sector and provides actionable guidance to aid decision-makers and stakeholders in the development and implementation of the U.S. Hydrogen Roadmap. Results and insights from this dissertation can be summarized as follows. Global barriers to hydrogen development, as identified in existing national hydrogen roadmaps, were shown to be infrastructure development, market development, and the need for research and development. Domestically, providing regulatory clarity and addressing decision makers’ lack of awareness were the two non-economic barriers that stakeholders identified as being the most impactful to hydrogen technology deployment today. Additionally, public perception of hydrogen resulted vi in surprisingly disparate views between industry and government employees – suggesting an opportunity for these groups to work together in addressing this barrier. To address public perception, private and public sectors should work together to develop balanced messages and address the public’s desire for additional information. Specifically, leak detection and safety considerations were top concerns for participants in the focus group participants in the Southwest Pennsylvania case study. Lastly, as regulatory policies are proposed and refined, incentives need to be carefully designed to ensure developers’ process designs and investments achieve the low?carbon goals of hydrogen technology. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, while no single variable can result in increasing a developer’s clean energy tax credit eligibility, the electricity grid mix provided the largest impact independently to emissions.",2025,5/20/25 15:39,5/20/25 15:39,5/20/25 15:39,10789442 Bytes,,,,,,Beyond the Bottom Line,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 10789442 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering; Other engineering; Other engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have integrated the methodologies of Michel Foucault and the theories of archetypal psychology developed by James Hillman with work done by Victor Turner as well as other work from the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, literary criticism, feminist theory, cultural studies and histories of the sixties era. I use this interdisciplinary data to inform a qualitative study of eighteen subjects raised by countercultural parents. I asked my subjects about their lives as children, teenagers, young adults, and currently approaching midlife. Through an analysis of these interviews I identified six cultural complexes specific to the counterculture that I then deconstructed and discussed as systems of knowing within the American culture of the last forty years: freedom, anti-authority, intense experience, cool, being real, and utopia. These complexes together provide a unique way of experiencing the world that informs the ethnological and psychological perspective of Post-Cool Kids, and provides them with a multi-schematic, process-based way of engaging with the world around them. I also discuss such topics as alternative education, communal experiences, drug addiction, creative thinking, embodied trauma, parental entwinement, and personal activism. My objective was to identify the transmission of culture from counterculture parents to their Post-Cool Kids. In the process I developed several unique methodological approaches. Merging postmodern theory, archetypal psychology and methods from religious studies and anthropology, I evaluate the nature of belief within a secular cultural context. Ultimately, I place American historical concepts of utopia side by side with the experience and multi-schematic perspective of Post-Cool Kids to suggest that they represent an emergent pattern in culture, and show how they can inform new theories of utopia.",2013,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,Post-cool kids,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Post-cool kids: How the children born into the counterculture of the American 1960s and 70s became a scattered, disorganized, postmodern tribe ISBN: 9781303075322 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 9 Volume: 74",,,,,Children; Counterculture; Ethnology; Parents; Psychology; Social psychology; Utopias,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IMQS7XZE,thesis,2016,"Horn, Abigail Lauren; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",Locating the source of large scale outbreaks of foodborne disease,,,,,,"Foodborne illness outbreaks impose enormous health and economic burdens in the US. Identifying the origin of the contaminated food causing an outbreak is a challenging problem due to the complexity of the food supply and the absence of coherent labeling and distribution records. Current investigative methods are slow, resource intensive, and the overwhelming majority of investigations are unsuccessful in identifying the location source of an outbreak. New tools and approaches that take advantage of modern data and analytical techniques are needed to more quickly identify outbreak origins and prioritize response efforts. The practical objective of this work is to improve the food safety regulator's ability to efficiently locate the source of an outbreak while contamination-caused illnesses are occurring, thereby resolving investigations earlier and averting potential illnesses. This thesis develops new methods that leverage currently unutilized or underutilized sources of information to identify the location source of an outbreak. A novel, network-theoretic approach to source detection is developed that (1) immediately identifies all feasible source locations, (2) ranks the feasible locations by the likelihood that each one is the true source, and (3) develops a decision model for guiding investigators to implement effective interventions. The approach functions on food system network data, reported cases of illness at specific times and locations, and a prior probability function over likely sources. The methodology is the first to be designed specifically for tracing back outbreaks on food distribution networks. A Monte Carlo simulation environment was developed to evaluate traceback performance and robustness across a wide range of network structures and outbreak scenarios. When compared against existing traceback methods, both those currently in practice and those in academic literature, this methodology demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and speed. Specific results suggest the approach can provide substantial benefits to the investigation process by identifying the source early enough in an outbreak's progression that a substantial fraction of cases of illness can be averted. These computational results serve as a powerful first step towards validating the accuracy and applicability of the approach. The immediate next step will be to demonstrate accuracy when applied to real food distribution networks. While acquiring representative network data for this purpose presents significant practical challenges, an additional contribution of this work is the identification of a representative network model that can be integrated with the source identification methodology, forming a holistic traceback framework.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 Ph.D.,Book Title: Locating the source of large scale outbreaks of foodborne disease,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Measurement campaigns can be costly, especially when the area of interest includes oceans, forests, agricultural regions or other dispersed spatial domains. Satellite based remote sensing offers a way to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of policy analysis concerning these systems. However, there are key limitations to the implementation of satellite data. Uncertainty in data derived from remote-sensing can be significant, and traditional methods of policy analysis for managing uncertainty on large datasets can be computationally expensive. Moreover, while satellite data can increasingly offer estimates of some parameters such as weather or crop use, other information regarding demographic or economic data is unlikely to be estimated using these techniques. Managing these challenges in practical policy analysis remains a challenge. In this dissertation, I conduct five case studies which rely heavily on data sourced from orbital sensors. First, I assess the magnitude of climate and anthropogenic stress on coral reef ecosystems. Second, I conduct an impact assessment of soil salinity on California agriculture. Third, I measure the propensity of growers to adapt their cropping practices to soil salinization in agriculture. Fourth, I analyze whether small-scale desalination units could be applied on farms in California in order mitigate the effects of drought and salinization as well as prevent agricultural drainage from entering vulnerable ecosystems. And fifth, I assess the feasibility of satellite-based remote sensing for salinity measurement at global scale. Through these case studies, I confront both the challenges and benefits associated with implementing satellite based-remote sensing for improved policy analysis.",8/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721313.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imperfect adherence decreases the average outcome effects measured during clinical trials and observational studies. Many methods exist to measure adherence which differ in their accuracy and costs, depending on the type of intervention. Study designs improve adherence through reminders to participants or evaluation during a run-in period. Analysis methods can account for imperfect adherence, but they vary in terms of the statistical assumptions required and the potential bias that each introduces. This dissertation applies decision science principals to create recommendations addressing how adherence should be measured, analyzed, and reported for future studies. Decision scientists can fill many roles in terms of informing policy analysis. Three roles addressed by this dissertation include (a) translating human behavior into analytic terms, (b) treating analysis as human behavior, and (c) facilitating two-way communication between experts and lay people. Chapter two addresses (a) by using a simulated clinical trial of a common hypertension drug in order to inform when collecting adherence information could be beneficial to researchers. The trial evaluates two trial designs, a randomized controlled trial with and without an enrichment period, and two analysis methods, intent-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis. This simulated trial finds that the costs of using a less pragmatic study design or more biased analysis method does not outweigh the benefits of the monetary savings that these approaches provide. Chapter three addresses (b) by evaluating how imperfect adherence is accounted for by researchers of software as medical device (SaMD) apps. The chapter uses normative criteria from the literature to evaluate how researchers measure and analyze adherence information. Our review finds that the majority of trials imperfectly reported adherence metrics (63%) and did not use an appropriate method to evaluate efficacy (75%). Future SaMD trials could be improved by reporting all facets of adherence, preregistering efficacy analyses, and using less biased analysis methods. Chapter four continues to address (b) by applying the recommendations found from Chapter three to evaluate the MyHealthyPregnancy (MHP) app. The MHP app collected observational data between September 2019 and February 2022. Metrics of each facet of usage find that usage of the MHP app during the study was very low. For example, the majority of participants used an app activity less than three days throughout the trial. An evaluation of the average treatment effect finds no evidence that the MHP app is effective at increasing gestational age at birth or reducing preterm birth risk. Analyzing the dose-response effect for app usage finds that increased use is correlated with increased gestational age at birth. The interpretation of this finding is limited by our knowledge of confounders and low usage of the app by study participants. In the future, studies could be improved through a randomized trial design and increased app usage. The sum of this work has identified many gaps between how researchers are currently accounting for imperfect adherence and how they could address this source of bias in the future. Researchers would benefit from measuring adherence both in terms of how users interact with an intervention and how they interact with recommendations from the intervention. They would also benefit from measuring and reporting on all facets of adherence. Analysis of adherence could be improved through the preregistration of efficacy analyses and more careful consideration of the confounders that could affect these analyses. Regulators could support these changes by creating clearer guidelines for accounting for imperfect adherence and more strict requirements for the preregistration of observational studies.",2023,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,1492159 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 1492159 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/YAZZWNQW/Grayek - 2023 - A Decision Science Approach Towards Improving the Study of Adherence Information.pdf,,,160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science; FOS: Mathematics; Statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ISP69JCI,thesis,2009,"Castillo, Andrea R.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Assessing computational methods and science policy in systems biology,,,,,,"In this thesis, I discuss the development of systems biology and issues in the progression of this science discipline. Traditional molecular biology has been driven by reductionism with the belief that breaking down a biological system into the fundamental biomolecular components will elucidate such phenomena. We have reached limitations with this approach due to the complex and dynamical nature of life and our inability to intuit biological behavior from a modular perspective [37]. Mathematical modeling has been integral to current system biology endeavors since detailed analysis would be invasive if performed on humans experimentally or in clinical trials [17]. The interspecies commonalities in systemic properties and molecular mechanisms suggests that certain behaviors transcend specie differentiation and therefore easily lend to generalizing from simpler organisms to more complex organisms such as humans [7, 17]. Current methodologies in mathematical modeling and analysis have been diverse and numerous, with no standardization to progress the discipline in a collaborative manner. Without collaboration during this formative period, successful development and application of systems biology for societal welfare may be at risk. Furthermore, such collaboration has to be standardized in a fundamental approach to discover generic principles, in the manner of preceding long-standing science disciplines. This study effectively implements and analyzes a mathematical model of a three-protein biochemical network, the Synechococcus elongatus circadian clock., (cont.) I use mass action theory expressed in kronecker products to exploit the ability to apply numerical methods-including sensitivity analysis via boundary value formulation (BVP) and trapiezoidal integration rule-and experimental techniques-including partial reaction fitting and enzyme-driven activations-when mathematically modeling large-scale biochemical networks. Amidst other applicable methodologies, my approach is grounded in the law of mass action because it is based in experimental data and biomolecular mechanistic properties, yet provides predictive power in the complete delineation of the biological system dynamics for all future time points. The results of my research demonstrate the holistic approach that mass action method-ologies have in determining emergent properties of biological systems. I further stress the necessity to enforce collaboration and standardization in future policymaking, with reconsiderations on current stakeholder incentive to redirect academia and industry focus from new molecular entities to interests in holistic understanding of the complexities and dynamics of life entities. Such redirection away from reductionism could further progress basic and applied scientific research to embetter our circumstances through new treatments and preventive measures for health, and development of new strains and disease control in agriculture and ecology [13].",2009,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2009 S.M.,Book Title: Assessing computational methods and science policy in systems biology,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IW4N2LLB,thesis,2013,"Reis, Lynn; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",An exploration of materials taxonomies to support streamlined life cycle assessment,,,,,,"As life cycle assessment (LCA) gains prominence as a reliable method of environmental evaluation, concerns about data availability and quality have become more important. LCA is a resource intensive methodology, and thus data gaps pose a frequent challenge, motivating the need for robust streamlining approaches. Existing methods for filling data gaps often ignore the effects of the uncertainty inherent in estimated data. Under-specification, or using structured data to provide less information in product characterization, is one option to incorporate uncertainty, and has been shown to be a viable method both for streamlining and decision-making under uncertainty. However, previous work did not emphasize developing robust data structures intended to balance trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency in streamlining methods. Furthermore, there was little consideration given to analyzing the environmental profile (multiple impacts) of a process, rather than a single impact. This thesis explores how data mining techniques can be used to quantitatively develop data structures to enable streamlined assessment. The use of clustering and principal component analysis is explored in an effort to identify potential material classifications, and other statistical methods further assess the classifications. These insights are used to create hierarchical taxonomies that are evaluated in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The method is applied to life cycle inventory process datasets for three material types (metals, polymers, and precious metals). Four environmental midpoints from the TRACI 2.0 impact assessment method are used to illustrate the uncertainty reduction enabled by classification. It was found that the most useful classification method for both metals and polymers was based on price, and for precious metals, material type and recycled content. In general, the method was able to select efficient groupings that accounted for a large percentage of the overall variation in the data. With one additional level in the taxonomy, the overall median percent error rates were approximately 30- 40% for all impacts except non carcinogenicity, which was 65-80%. This is compared to initial error rates that were on average twice as high for the metals and precious metals datasets. Case studies demonstrated how the analysis and structure provided by this methodology can be useful in comparative decision-making, to reduce the number of elements prioritized for detailed data collection in triage methods, and for developing models to predict materials' impacts. This work serves as a framework for structuring data to enable streamlined LCA as well as provides guidance for predictive model development. By showing the feasibility of developing effective and efficient taxonomies, the work demonstrates a method to reduce the amount of information required to characterize a product while achieving relatively low uncertainty in the final product impact.",2013,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2013 S.M.,Book Title: An exploration of materials taxonomies to support streamlined life cycle assessment,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These technologies have enabled us to recognize many forms of community—from close knit social groups to individuals who merely co-habit public spaces—and to support interaction with each other in novel ways. The notion that modern digital technology holds promises of democratization by expanding access to information and broadening modes of knowledge production often fails to acknowledge that these benefits rely upon devices and infrastructure whose availability reflect socioeconomic contours; that the technologies that enable information access can also reinforce rather than obviate marginality due to barriers to access and suitability. This assessment points to opportunities for better understanding and better designing technologies for the marginalized or dispossessed. The research presented in this dissertation discusses the findings from empirical, theoretical, and design based investigations of technology use with the urban homeless. The empirical work provides a foundation for understanding current technology practices among the homeless and their care providers. The theoretical investigation develops Deweyan publics as a novel frame for participatory design. The design-based investigation presents findings from the design and deployment of the Community Resource Messenger at a shelter for homeless mothers.

However, the construction and operation of large hydropower plants may affect the environment, the local economy, and the population surrounding those projects. Considering the magnitude of the investments and the potential impacts for the Amazon basin, it is crucial to apply policy analysis techniques to support informed decisions about whether the construction of large hydropower plants in the Amazon is the best alternative to supply the additional electricity that Brazil needs, taking into account economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits. Here, I apply three different quantitative policy analysis techniques to assess three major questions related to the construction of hydropower plants in the Amazon region. First, I study the greenhouse gas emissions from hydropower reservoirs in the Amazon. Second, I explore the local socio-economic impacts of building hydropower plants.

J6HHCYFA,thesis,2015,"Fingerhut, Henry Alan; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",A systems framework and modeling approach to predict and manage the mental health effects of a military conflict,,,,,,"Combat-related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) poses complex challenges for policymakers that systems analysis could help elucidate. True population prevalence and future clinical need are highly uncertain, because individuals' PTSD symptomatology may fluctuate in time. Though we increasingly measure policy outcomes, outcome metrics often address direct, short-term effects, so the impact on long-term prevalence is unclear. The PTSD burden involves a diverse set of actors across domains who independently make decisions based on incomplete information. Systems analysis can indicate how these local aspects of the PTSD burden jointly impact long-term prevalence and identify leverage points for PTSD mitigation. This thesis presents a systems framework and stochastic modeling approach to predict PTSD prevalence and clinical demand over the decades following the current Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi Freedom (OIF). The system developed in this study incorporates the literature on PTSD symptom dynamics and social factors governing its recognition and treatment in order to identify the structure and dynamics of the PTSD burden. The simulation results indicate the extent to which PTSD is chronic, prevalent, and resistant to treatment. The best-case model predicts that 11-16% of OEF/OIF combat veterans will maintain a long-term need for PTSD services, and as many as 23% of OEF/OIF combat veterans will seek PTSD-related health care at least once in their lives. By controlling for symptom dynamics, model results account for a large component of the variation in empirically observed prevalence rates. Sensitivity and policy analyses show that care-seeking factors tend to have the most significant effect on long-term PTSD prevalence. Model limitations and assumptions are documented, particularly regarding symptom and care-seeking dynamics and parameter interactions, to provide the basis for future empirical and analytical work to elaborate systemic complexities underlying military mental health. The current study specifically addresses OEF/OIF combat-related PTSD, however this approach may be generalized to other populations and mental health concerns. This study has three main policymaking implications. First, study predictions regarding long-term PTSD prevalence and clinical demand can be used for clinical planning and resource allocation over time. Second, baseline model results indicate the long-term limits of current best practice PTSD mitigation efforts. Third, the study identifies effective policy levers by indicating the factors with the greatest direct impact on long-term PTSD prevalence.",2015,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 S.M.,Book Title: A systems framework and modeling approach to predict and manage the mental health effects of a military conflict,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JASCYKN4,thesis,2015,"Chang, Michael Tse-Gene; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Performance targets for electric vehicle batteries,,,,,,"Light-duty vehicle transportation accounted for 17.2% of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2012 [95]. An important strategy for reducing CO₂ emissions emitted by light-duty vehicles is to reduce per-mile CO₂ emissions. While one approach is to improve vehicle efficiency, greater reductions in emissions can be achieved by switching from gasoline vehicles to electric vehicles, if the electric vehicles run on electricity from clean energy sources. Batteries affect the consumer adoption of electric vehicles by influencing two important vehicle characteristics: cost and driving range on a single charge. The cost of the battery is a significant fraction of total vehicle cost, and the battery's energy capacity determines driving range. To lower battery costs and improve battery energy capacity, further research is needed. To guide such research, several organizations have created performance targets for batteries, including the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and the US Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC). The goal of this thesis is to assess these performance targets based on real-world vehicle performance. A method is developed for estimating the energy requirements of personal vehicle travel, which improves upon previous methods by accounting for per-trip variation of vehicle energy consumption and analyzing data with wider geographic scope. The method consists of a model of battery-to-wheel vehicle energy consumption and a conditional bootstrap procedure for combining GPS travel data with large-scale data from the US National Household Travel Survey. The research finds that the distribution of energy requirements for US vehicle-trips and vehicle-days (the sum of all trips taken in a day) has a heavy tail, namely that a small proportion of long trips accounts for a disproportionately large amount of energy consumption. Current electric vehicle batteries (2011 Nissan Leaf) can satisfy 83% of vehicle-days, which account for 53% of all energy consumed in personal vehicle travel, while batteries that meet the performance targets can satisfy 98 to 99% of vehicle-days, which account for 90 to 96% of energy. These results allow for a quantification of the benefits of meeting performance targets for battery energy capacity, which can help assess technology readiness and guide allocation of research funding.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Performance targets for electric vehicle batteries,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JCIU5GAH,thesis,2018,"Merchán Dueñas, Daniel Esteban; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Effects of road-network circuity on strategic decisions in urban logistics,,,,,,"This thesis proposes a research framework that leverages high-resolution traffic and urban infrastructure data to improve analytical approximation methods used to inform strategic decisions in designing last-mile distribution systems. In particular, this thesis explores the effects of the road-network on the circuity of local trips, and introduces data-driven extensions to improve predictive performance of route distance approximation methods by increasing the resolution of the underlying urban road-network. Overall, these circuity-based extensions significantly increase the real-world validity of routing approximations compared to classical methods, and entail relevant implications in the configuration of logistics networks within urban markets. The framework presented in this thesis entails three inter-dependent levels of analysis: individual trip, consolidated route and last-mile network levels. In Chapter 2, we introduce a method to quantify and analyze the network circuity of local trips leveraging contemporary traffic datasets. Using the city of Sao Paulo as the primary illustrative example and a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, significant heterogeneities in local network circuity are observed, explained by dimensional and topological properties of the road-network. Results from Sao Paulo are compared to seven additional large and medium-sized urban areas in Latin America and the United States. At a coarse-grained level of analysis, we observe similar correlations between road-network properties and local circuity across these cities. In Chapter 3, this thesis proposes a data-driven extension to continuum approximation-based methods used to predict urban route distances. This extension efficiently incorporates the circuity of the underlying road-network into the approximation method to improve distance predictions in more realistic settings. The proposed extension significantly outperforms classic methods, which build on the assumption of travel according to the rectilinear distance metric within urban areas. By only marginally increasing the data collection effort, results of the proposed extension yield error reductions between 20-30% in mean absolute percentage error compared to classical approximation methods and are within 10 - 20% compared to near-optimal solutions obtained with a local search heuristic. Further, by providing a real-world validation of classic continuum approximation-based methods, we explore how contemporary mapping technologies and novel sources of geo-spatial and traffic data can be efficiently leveraged to improve the predictive performance of these methods. Finally, building on the augmented route distance approximation, in Chapter 4 we explore the effect of road-network circuity on the design and planning of urban last-mile distribution systems. These improved routing approximations are used within an integer linear programming model to solve large-scale, real-world instances of the two-echelon capacitated location routing problem. Using the parcel delivery operation of Brazil's largest e-commerce platform in the city of Sao Paulo as the primary example to illustrate the impact and relevance of this work, we demonstrate how explicitly accounting for local variations in road-network circuity can yield relevant implications for fleet capacity planning, the location of urban distribution facilities, and the definition of facility-specific service areas. Results indicate that failing to account for local circuity would underestimate the necessary fleet size by 20% and would increase the total last-mile network cost by approximately 8%.",2018,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2018 Ph.D.,Book Title: Effects of road-network circuity on strategic decisions in urban logistics,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JF3MEEPU,thesis,2010,"Morisset, Thomas; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Comparing capacities and delays at major European and American airports,,,,,,"Successful air transport systems must satisfy the demand for flights while maintaining a high level of service and safety. For airports, which have limited capacities, policy-makers must compromise between maximizing the number of flights served and avoiding excessive delays. Differences between policies adopted in the US and in Europe result in distinct airport performances, the analysis of which reveals best practices. The first point of comparison is over the capacities of a set of the busiest airports in the US and Europe. Under radar-based air traffic control procedures, Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), American airports achieve equal or higher capacities than European airports with similar runway layouts. These discrepancies cannot be explained by the differences in separation requirements alone. Besides, through their extensive use of Visual Flight Rules (VFR), weather permitting, American airports gain an important premium on their capacities. US air traffic control practices and policies clearly result in a more efficient use of airport infrastructure. Second, arrival delays relative to schedule increase over the course of the day at the US airports, while they remain mostly constant in Europe. Similarly the distributions of these delays show that schedule reliability at airports is significantly better in Europe than in the US. These comparisons underscore the benefits of Europe's policy of airport slot-controls, which cap the number of aircraft movements at a declared capacity. Moreover, arrival delays in the US are much higher under IFR (23 minutes average) than VFR (9 minutes). This shows that the high variability of the capacity of US airports depending on weather conditions, coupled with the tendency toward over-scheduling of flights, is damaging to the national airport system's stability and reliability. From these comparisons stem a few policy recommendations. Airline schedule reliability might benefit from additional controls or economic incentives to rationalize the scheduling of aircraft movements at some US airports. At the same time, some European airports could benefit from increasing their declared capacities. More generally, European aviation authorities should consider relaxing air traffic control separation procedures along the lines of US practices.",2010,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: Comparing capacities and delays at major European and American airports,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JIKM2QC5,thesis,2015,"Kemeny, Carlos Alexandre",Three Studies on Institutional Environment and the Private Equity Continuum: From Early-Stage Venture Capital Investments to Buyouts,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Three_Studies_on_Institutional_Environment_and_the_Private_Equity_Continuum_From_Early-Stage_Venture_Capital_Investments_to_Buyouts/6723914/1,"This dissertation evaluates the effects of the institutional environment on investment and performance in the private equity industry. It provides insights on how trade secret protection can increase venture capital (VC) investment through a state court’s favorability toward the inevitable disclosure doctrine, the effect of anti-takeover regulation as it relates to private equity firm buyout performance, and the role that political context has in determining VC distributions to different states. Data analysis is based on Thomson Reuters’ VentureXpert for VC investment and geography, inevitable disclosure rulings gathered from multiple sources, a proprietary database on private equity firm buyout performance, and election results at the state and national levels of the United States. Three studies were conducted, which comprise this dissertation. The first paper investigates how inevitable disclosure, a form of trade secret protection, affects the geography of VC investment in the United States. Results show that a rule in favor of inevitable disclosure increases the overall amount of VC inflows and the proportion of investment by non-local VCs in a state more than an against or no rule. Mechanisms are addressed that can explain these findings by considering how a court decision on inevitable disclosure might increase the probability of obtaining a court injunction against a former employee departure and the predictability of that probability. The second paper extends experiential learning theory by arguing that the degree of causal ambiguity in firm decisions likely differs not only across different settings (i.e. operational vs. strategic), but also across different stages of the same strategic decision. With particular regard to acquisitions, the selection stage seems to be less causally ambiguous than the restructuring stage. Since experience translates into learning to a lesser extent when causal ambiguity is greater, acquisition experience translates more readily into learning to select than into learning to add value. Accordingly, results show that more experienced acquirers should perform better in scenarios when the focal acquisition is more selection- (rather than restructuring-) oriented, such as when (1) the educational background of the acquiring firm’s top management is more finance- (rather than business-) oriented; and (2) the information environment is less transparent. Results are largely consistent with the notion that correlation between acquisition experience and performance is more positive when the firm’s capacity to select target companies is more relevant. The third paper attempts to uncover the effects of political context, as it relates to VC distributions to different states across the United States. The primary finding is that VC investment distributions increase when states that elect a Republican governor also vote for a Democratic presidential candidate (regardless if that candidate wins). Additionally, as the stability of a Republican gubernatorial regime increases, VC investment decreases. Finally, results show that policies that improve the quality of financial institutions (through the number of IPOs) might help explain the political effects on VC, whereas tax policy (through capital gains tax rate) and proentrepreneurship policy (through the number of new firms) do not.",5/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Three Studies on Institutional Environment and the Private Equity Continuum,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723914.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JJ7V4X5W,thesis,2015,"Heo, Jinhyok",Evaluation of Air Quality Impacts on Society: Methods and Application,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Evaluation_of_Air_Quality_Impacts_on_Society_Methods_and_Application/6716489/1,"Though essential for informed decision-making, it is challenging to estimate the public health impacts of air quality because it must address the complicated atmospheric processes of air pollutants: emissions, dispersion, chemistry, and removal. Employing a chemical transport model (CTM) is the most rigorous way to address these atmospheric processes. The first part of this thesis analyzed the potential risk of ammonia emissions from post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology using a CTM. It was found that, if not controlled properly, CCS ammonia may create a serious public health problem, substantially compromising the benefit of reducing carbon dioxide. The results will guide the level of appropriate control for a wide range of future scenarios. CTMs are expensive from a computational standpoint and, therefore, beyond the reach of policy analysis for many types of problems. On the other hand, current tools used for policy analysis fall short of the rigor of CTMs and may lead to biased results. To address this gap, we developed the Estimating Air Pollution Social Impacts Using Regression (EASIUR) method, which builds parameterizations that predict per-tonne social cost and intake fraction at any location in the United States like a CTM with negligible computational costs. With tagged CTM simulations, the EASIUR method builds a dataset of air quality impacts for a large number of representative emissions sources in the United States and then derives parameterizations for those results. We used an “average plume,” a generic PM2.5 plume generated from CTM results, to describe the exposed population over large receptor areas around an emissions source. The parameterizations have intuitive functional forms with population and common atmospheric variables; their coefficients explain key underlying mechanisms. Out-of-sample evaluations meet the ‘excellent’ criteria of a common air quality model performance metric in most cases, with some exceptions meeting the ‘good’ criteria. We found that the average seasonal per-tonne social costs in the United States are $150,000-180,000/t EC, $21,000-34,000/t SO2, $4,200-15,000/t NOx, and $29,000-85,000/t NH3. It is hoped that the EASIUR model will be of great use in policy research that involves changes in air quality.",2/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,Evaluation of Air Quality Impacts on Society,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716489.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technology refers to hardware, software and telecommunication systems used in the management and processing of information. Information is the result of data processing, collection and analysis that can add knowledge to the recipient of the information while communication is a process of transferring information, feelings, ideas and thoughts from one individual to another individual or group of individuals.ICT is a very important medium in daily work where human life today is dominated by technology. ICT not only simplifies and eases human work but also changes the way people live today. Through this ICT facility, users can access and obtain information quickly and quickly and can avoid wasting time and energy.Malaysia today is in the era of ICT progress by the year 2020. Malaysia will emerge as a developed country where today the government is trying to implement various programs on ICT that aim to provide benefits and benefits to Malaysia and society in particular. In moving towards the ICT era, various innovations have been introduced especially in the Public Service System (SPA). Changes and reforms in the SPA are very necessary as the scenario inside and outside the country is getting more complicated and challenging. The process of globalization, liberalization and ICT development that is increasing rapidly demands SPA to make various efforts to reform and improve the system.Therefore, the government is working on pioneering the MSC mega project as a stage to prepare for this information revolution. Malaysia is not lagging behind in implementing the electronic government (EG) policy to take advantage of the use of ICT as an agent of progress in public services. Electronic Government aims to increase the productivity and effectiveness of public services towards more outstanding achievements through the use of ICT. Malaysia also hopes that the use of ICT will have a positive impact on the country's economic, political, social and administrative development.The use of ICT is growing rapidly and the main purpose is to smooth and speed up the management system for an organization. The main goal of government departments switching to the use of ICT is to improve their productivity and service quality where Malaysia wants to form a government that is oriented towards the use of ICT and further eliminate the use of paper in all administrative matters or better known as online government services. When compared to manual work methods, the use of ICT can save a large part of time and energy that can be used for other tasks.Online services are now becoming increasingly important where according to the Director General of the Malaysian Administration Modernization and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU), Datuk Mohamad Zabidi Zainal, 90 percent of government services will be provided online by 2015. This is set out in the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) which needs to be achieved in line with efforts to transform existing services into online services by fully utilizing the speed of ICT (Daily News, 27 January 2012). Therefore, all departments are urged to make a paradigm shift in their management system through the use of ICT. The purpose is to increase efficiency in working and produce effective work.However, in terms of the implementation of the use of ICT in public services, there are still a few staff who refuse to use all the facilities provided. This was confirmed by the secretary of the Sabah Federation, Datuk Muhammad Hatta Ab. Aziz while inaugurating an ICT seminar at the Sabah National Institute of Public Administration (INTAN) campus (Bernama, 1 January 2011).",2015,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,may,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Keberkesanan Penggunaan Teknologi Maklumat Dan Komunikasi (ICT) Di Jabatan Penguatkuasaan Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur (DBKL) ISBN: 9798380466271,,,,,Information technology; Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyze the conditions that facilitate developing country entrepreneurs to learn about business models and the incentive of local and multinational firms to carry out experiments for BoP adaptations. We test our frameworks’ implications on the evolution of the mobile telecommunications industry across Africa. Contrary to the economic models that posit one-directional investments from the North to the South, our findings suggest a two-step industrialization process. The spillover of modern-industry knowledge from the North through Joint Ventures enables a few entrepreneurial firms in the South to gain access to valuable knowledge with which they actively experiment and, through successful BoP adaptations, gain ownership advantages and further internationalize across the South, catalyzing the growth of the industry. Overall, the thesis shows how these entrepreneurial firms with a particular heritage are at the core and explain most of the development of the mobile industry in sub-Saharan Africa. This thesis further explores the factors that influenced the diffusion of mobile telephony in Africa. Whereas prior research has focused on the role of country and industry characteristics in country-level measures namely the adoption rate of new products and services, price, total investment and employment in related sector, this thesis examines whether such patterns across countries can be influenced by the heterogeneity in quality of firms that enter in those countries. The thesis also presents a set of detailed case studies of pioneering companies, including two of these key entrepreneurial firms with heritage.",8/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723752.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, an evaluation of different decarbonizing strategies across nations is missing in the literature. This dissertation consists of two methodologically distinct but related studies looking at the environmental, climate, and public health impacts of freight transportation. In the second chapter, I look at these impacts in the context of ocean shipping in India and explore the emissions reduction potential of shore power in India. However, given how dirty and emissions-intensive India’s electricity generation currently is, I show that shore power is not a cost-effective strategy to reduce air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions in India. In the third chapter, I evaluate freight trucking pollution impacts across the contiguous United States and the implications of trucking pollution on minority group populations. Based on my analysis, I find that the environmental and climate social costs due to freight trucking in the US result in ~$17B in environmental damages and ~$25B in climate damages, respectively. Further, more trucking pollution occurs in counties and census tracts with a higher proportion of Black and Hispanic populations.

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are an important tool in resource-constrained settings, as they do not rely on costly lab equipment and specially trained personnel. In Uganda's private sector clinics and drug shops, which is where the majority of patients first seek care, diagnosis of malaria is often presumptive and patients receive neither RDT nor microscopy. Several studies have focused on the patient perspective (e.g. willingness to pay and willingness to be tested) but much less is understood about the supplier perspective (e.g. willingness to stock). This study aimed to understand the preferences and priorities of agents across the malaria RDT supply chain in Uganda on stocking the devices using multi-criteria decision analysis. This methodology was adapted to be relevant and understandable for agents in Uganda so that it was possible to analyze business decisions incorporating a multiplicity of attributes such as selling price, purchase cost, sales volume, complexity of regulations, waste management, and training available. Data surveys and semistructured interviews were collected from 28 private sector retailers (i.e., shopkeepers, pharmacists, clinic managers), two first line buyers, and three distributors. Analysis of the data resulted in the construction of value functions for all agents, the relative weights (therefore the tradeoffs) among decision criteria, and the calculation of an overall value for the decision about whether or not to stock RDTs for the different supply chain agents. Results indicate that the best option for one level of the supply chain is not necessarily the best for another. A discussion offers insights on how to align value across the supply chain, which is important for facilitating public health interventions.",2015,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Using multi-criteria decision analysis to assess private sector agents' preferences and priorities in stocking malaria rapid diagnostic test kits in Uganda,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JRS7L5FC,thesis,2012,"Machaka, Ronald",Ion Implantation into Boron Suboxide: Formation of Boron-Rich Structures and Related Phenomena,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/3152862928?pq-origsite=primo,"This thesis focuses on the boron suboxide B6O, a boron-rich super-hard ceramic material. With hardness values previously reported between 24 GPa and 45 GPa, B6O is one of the hardest known materials. Although first reports on boron suboxides date back as far as 1909 (Weintraub E., Transactions of the American Electrochemical Society, 16 (1909) 165), it is the B6O-based composites that have attracted considerable interest in recent years due to their enormous technological potential, especially as an alternative to polycrystalline diamond and polycrystalline cubic boron nitride for wear and abrasive applications. Investigations into the properties of B6O itself appear to have been neglected in favour of the improvement of densification and fracture toughness of the composites.The B6O samples used for the work reported in this work was hot-pressed was prepared under an argon environment at 1800 C and 50 MPa for 20 minutes followed metallographical preparation. The density of the hot-pressed compacts measured 2.44 g/cm3. The starting B6O powder material was supplied from the Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems, Dresden.This thesis primarily seeks to generate and report as much practical data for polycrystalline B6O materials prepared by uniaxial hot-pressing as possible from a variety of characterization techniques. Firstly, the Raman spectra of hot-pressed B6O, which was until now poorly understood, was investigated using using a 514.5 nm green Ar+ laser excitation source. Secondly, the fundamental nature of some mechanical properties of hot-pressed B6O were investigated by means of Vickers and Berkovich indentation techniques. New approaches for data analysis, especially the investigations of the nanomechanical properties of hot-pressed B6O by Berkovich nanoindentation, were also suggested. Thirdly, the intrinsic hardness of hot-pressed B6O was investigated by means of a comprehensive inter-model comparison study. Fourthly, a combined experimental and simulation approach for determining mechanical properties of hot-pressed B6O by nanoindentation was also carried out, based on the outcomes of the study, the deformation response of the material under dynamic indentation was investigated at different stages using a custom developed finite element model. Finally, based on the preliminary ab initio density functional calculations of the structural properties of B6O conducted by Lowther showing that the presence of a high electronegativity interstitial in the B6O structure could enhance the strength of the bonding in B6O, fluorine ion implantation into B6O were conducted. The effects to the structural and the nanomechanical properties of radiation damage induced by ion implantation was investigated. The possible formation of novel nanostructures in the ion-irradiated B6O matrix near-surface was also investigated.Results obtained from this study provides a vast amount of practical data for hot-pressed B6O materials as well as a number of novel analysis approaches for the extraction useful properties from the measured raw data. Firstly, using an automated background subtraction method, observable first- and second-order Raman spectra of B6O were obtained. A comparative analysis with previously reported spectra of other α-rhombohedral boron-rich ceramic materials demonstrate a good agreement. Results also confirm the existence of highly resolved Raman modes measured at ambient conditions using a green Ar+ excitation source which is contrary to the conventional understanding. Secondly, results from the micro-indentation investigations indicate the measured microhardness exhibits indentation load dependence. A model inter-comparison study of indentation size effects in the microhardness measurements of hot-pressed B6O is comprehensively discussed. Thirdly, the intrinsic hardness value of 30 GPa was deduced. Fourthly, a quantitative analysis approach was developed to simulate multi-cycling loading load-displacement curves from a single measured load-displacement nanoindentation curve. Based on the results, the nature of the indentation size effect in the nanoindentation hardness as well as the intrinsic nanomechanical properties of hot-pressed B6O were established. Fifthly, a combined experimental and finite element method simulation approach for determining mechanical properties of hot-pressed B6O by nanoindentation was developed. Based on the outcomes of the combined experimental and simulation studies, the deformation response of the material under dynamic indentation was also investigated at different stages using a custom developed finite element model. Finally, results from the structural characterization of the ion implanted B6O material demonstrates the formation of novel nanostructures by means of the ion bombardment of B6O. In addition, the study presented here also seeks to investigate the effects of the fluorine ion implantation on the near-surface nanomechanical properties of hot-pressed B6O.The principal conclusions that the study provide are both comprehensive practical data for B6O materials prepared by uniaxial hot-pressing. A number of properties, including the Raman spectra, the intrinsic hardness, and the radiation resistance and the effects of radiation damage are reported in the thesis.",2012,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,Ion Implantation into Boron Suboxide,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Ion Implantation into Boron Suboxide: Formation of Boron-Rich Structures and Related Phenomena ISBN: 9798346899501,,,,,Materials science; Nanoscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research explores traditional engineering and biotechnology practices for overarching principles of design, testing and demonstration that address safety concerns. The information is used to assess the current state of design, testing and demonstration in current synthetic biology projects addressing safety. Component and system design literature provide an engineering backbone of safety systems however, biological attributes such as mutation, growth, and multiplication create safety gaps, where biological engineering practices are needed. These principles are organized into categories of design and testing, and testing and demonstration to gain greater insight on where gaps in the literature might lie. Retrospective cases of traditional engineering and current cases of biotechnologies provide external validation and further illustrate which practices address which design, testing and demonstration needs. While most of the traditional engineering cases addressed safety through design and testing, when they were faced with questions of safety, they presented specific efforts to gain public confidence. The pro-biotics case was different in that the safety concerns came from the scientific community since history is being used as the convincing demonstration of safety. The three synthetic biology research projects cross the divide between traditional engineering and biotechnologies, but theses efforts are firmly in the area of design and testing.

Estimates suggest that ideally, the electricity sector would be responsible for approximately 85% of emissions abatement associated with climate polices such as America’s Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES). This is equivalent to ~50% cumulative emissions reductions below projected cumulative business-as-usual (BAU) emissions. Achieving these levels of emissions reductions will require dramatic changes in the US electricity generating infrastructure: almost all of the fossil-generation fleet will need to be replaced with low-carbon sources and society is likely to have to maintain a high build rate of new capacity for decades. Unfortunately, the inertia in the electricity sector means that there may be physical constraints to the rate at which new electricity generating capacity can be built. Because the build rate of new electricity generating capacity may be limited, the timing of regulation is critical—the longer the U.S. waits to start reducing GHG emissions, the faster the turnover in the electricity sector must occur in order to meet the same target. There is a real, and thus far unexplored, possibility that the U.S. could delay climate change policy implementation for long enough that it becomes infeasible to attain the necessary rate of turnover in the electricity sector. This dissertation investigates the relationship between climate policy timing and infrastructure turnover in the electricity sector. The goal of the dissertation is to answer the question: How long can we wait before constraints on infrastructure turnover in the electricity sector make achieving our climate goals impossible? Using the Infrastructure Flow Assessment Model, which was developed in this work, this dissertation shows that delaying climate change policy increases average retirements rates by 200-400%, increases average construction rates by 25-85% and increases maximum construction rates by 50-300%. It also shows that delaying climate policy has little effect on the age of retired plants or the stranded costs associated with premature retirement. In order for the electricity sector to reduce emissions to a level required by ACES while limiting construction rates to within achievable levels, it is necessary to start immediately. Delaying the process of decarbonization means that more abatement will be necessary from other sectors or geoengineering. By not starting emissions abatement early, therefore, the US forfeits its most accessible abatement potential and increases the challenge of climate change mitigation unnecessarily.",5/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,How the Timing of Climate Change Policy Affects Infrastructure Turnover in the Electricity Sector,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6719882.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the operation of UAS in civil aviation has been limited since there are a lot of uncertainties: a regulatory scheme needs to be established and associated technologies need to be developed. This thesis contributes to both technology development and establishing a regulatory scheme for UAS by generating safety constraints using the new methodology developed by Professor Leveson and Dr. Fleming. This methodology is called ""'Systems-Theoretic Early Concept Analysis"" (STECA) and is based on Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) analysis, which is also developed by the professor. STECA has potential to generate more safety constraints that have not been considered otherwise in the early stage of development and this allows the producer to redesign the entire system with potentially less cost. This thesis illustrates why and how STECA can be powerful to support integration of UAS into NAS. In addition, this thesis actually demonstrates how STECA derives safety constraints as a case study and shows how the safety constraints should be integrated in the system development.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Deriving safety constraints for integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace by application of STECA,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JTHJEBWA,thesis,2015,Putbrese Benjamin L; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,Exploring design and policy options for orbital infrastructure projects,,,,,,"The space industry is currently at a significant inflection point. New economies are forming in low- Earth orbit (LEO), driven by miniaturization of technologies and the promise of lower launch costs, which should then allow many of these LEO systems to capitalize on designs incorporating smaller, shorter-lived spacecraft in highly-disaggregated constellations. Meanwhile, many spacecraft at geosynchronous orbit are continuing along a trend towards increasingly massive and longer-lasting satellites, and while they do represent some of the most exquisite, highest-performing satellites ever launched, some experts now feel that such trends are unsustainable and are beginning to place increasing strain on the underlying industry. To support current and future spacecraft, orbital infrastructures have been proposed as a means of providing on-orbit services to customer spacecraft and guiding space architectures towards more sustainable paradigms. In LEO, an infrastructure of communications and data relay spacecraft is envisioned as a means of aiding new and existing space enterprises in the areas of satellite connectivity and downlink capability. Meanwhile, an on-orbit servicing (OOS) infrastructure, located primarily in geosynchronous orbit, would provide services such as repair, rescue, refueling, and upgrading of customer spacecraft, in order to alleviate the identified space industry trends. Physics and cost modeling, as well as tradespace exploration, are used to identify optimal LEO infrastructure designs, while system dynamics modeling is used to assess the trends likely to occur in the overall space industry as OOS is incorporated into space architectures. The primary conclusion from the analysis of LEO infrastructure designs is that, when designing for global connectivity, there is an optimal design point between a small constellation of larger spacecraft and a very large constellation of small spacecraft, but this will also depend on the intended mission of the infrastructure and the number of customers expecting to be serviced. Then, for an OOS infrastructure, it is determined that relatively low costs and heavy incorporation of servicing capabilities into customer architectures are needed to ensure long-term sustainability of such a project. Finally, the policy implications for both infrastructure concepts are discussed, with a heavy focus on options for the funding and development regimes employed to implement the infrastructures, as well as the major political and legal implications expected to accompany these projects.",2015,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Exploring design and policy options for orbital infrastructure projects,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As patient-generated text becomes more common, natural language processing techniques can estimate semantic content like affect in writing, opening another route to risk detection. This thesis identi?es methods to supplement traditional risk detection procedures like self report measures and discussion with clinicians with computational analysis of reflective written language. I apply natural language processing techniques to extract information like emotional or thematic content from people's writing, then customize and train models to estimate writers' psychosocial risks. Two of the studies additionally present methods for elicitation of original data for this purpose, with both datasets coming from pregnant and postpartum respondents. Computational risk detection models could expand the scope of mental health screening beyond doctors' offices and formalized measures to anywhere a person in need of help decides to reach out. In addition, identifying those language features which best indicate elevated risk could extend practitioners' understanding of the ways that that risk can appear, potentially providing or reinforcing heuristics for clinicians to screen for risk during normal appointments.",7/8/22,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/20111099.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/VIQ756RP/Allen - 2022 - Analyzing Natural Language for Real-Time Risk Identification and Communication.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this thesis, I present analyses of four different aspects of this transition, with an emphasis on the PJM Interconnection. The effects of bulk electricity storage on the PJM market I analyze the value of three storage technologies in the PJM day-ahead energy market, using a reduced-form unit commitment model with 2010 data. I find that large-scale storage would increase overall social welfare in PJM. However, the annualized capital costs of storage would exceed social welfare gains. Consumers would save up to $4 billion annually, largely at the expense of generator surplus. Storage modestly increases emissions of CO2 and other pollutants. The external costs and benefits of wind energy in PJM Large deployments of wind create external costs and benefits that are not fully captured in power purchase agreements. I find that wind’s external costs in the PJM market are uncertain but significant when compared to levelized PPA prices. Pollution reduction benefits are very uncertain but exceed external costs with high probability. The climate and health effects of a USA switch from coal to gas electricity generation I analyze the emission benefits created by a hypothetical scenario in which all U.S. coal plants are switched to natural gas plants in 2016. The net effect on warming is unclear; results are highly sensitive to the rate of fugitive methane emissions and the efficiency of replacement gas plants. However, the human health benefits of such a switch are substantial. The costs of building and operating new gas plants likely exceed the health benefits. Robust resource adequacy planning in the face of coal retirements Over the next decade, many U.S. coal-fired power plants are expected to retire, posing a challenge to system planners. I investigate the resource adequacy requirements of the PJM Interconnection, and how procuring less capacity may affect reliability. I find that PJM’s 2010 reserve margin of 20.5% was sufficient to achieve the stated reliability standard with 90% confidence. PJM could reduce reserve margins to 13% and still achieve levels of reliability accepted by other power systems.",9/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Reducing Carbon Intensity in Restructured Markets,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721280.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
K38UXIAT,thesis,2009,"Nadeau, Marie-Claude; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Evaluating manufacturing flexibility driven by learning,,,,,,"A defining feature of modern industry is operating in a context of nearly continuous technological change. Nevertheless, industrial decision-makers must select technologies and implement production strategies even in the face of known-to-be-incomplete information and environmental uncertainties. Further complicating the picture, the performance, including the economic performance, associated with novel technology options is likely to change over time. To address this problem, two approaches are possible: improving the quality of currently available information, and implementing flexible production strategies. The present work characterizes how the former approach impacts the valuation of the latter. First, a dynamic approach integrating learning curves and process-based cost modeling is used to examine learning in manufacturing, thus allowing decision-makers to incorporate information about expected technology evolution into their economic evaluations of technology. The approach is applied to an automotive assembly process, and quantifies the cost impacts of learning improvements in manufacturing time, downtime, and defect rates. Analysis can be used to focus learning activities on primary learning operational drivers, and to forecast cost improvements for a novel process. Flexibility strategies are often focused on capital-intensive processes, while labor-intensive processes are thought to be inherently flexible. The existence of learning effects, however, implies that labor flexibility has costs and, potentially, benefits in the context of uncertainty. A simple automotive assembly case is used here to illustrate the impact of manufacturing learning on labor flexibility and its economic value. A framework using cash-flow and decision tree models is introduced to quantify the costs and benefits of acquiring worker flexibility, and improve information available for strategic decision-making in labor-intensive systems. The front-end characterization of the technical drivers of learning provides insight into how the value of flexibility can be impacted at the operational level, enabling managers to prioritize improvements and minimize the costs of flexibility.",2009,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2009 S.M.,Book Title: Evaluating manufacturing flexibility driven by learning,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Energy efficiency has been identified as a low-cost resource of reducing energy use and hence the carbon footprint in the buildings sector. As a result, a myriad of policy actions has been put in place to ensure that energy reduction goals can be achieved through energy efficiency. This dissertation performs a critical examination of some of these programs and policies that have been put in place with the aim ofensuring that their intended efforts are indeed achieved. This work also provides a prospective look into other considerations e.g. the inclusion of broader health and environmental benefits needed to be made when making the decision about building energy efficiency. In Chapter 2, I use a panel data approach to measure the association of policy implementation at different levels of the government with increases in green building adoption. I find that the effectiveness of green building policies is dependent on both the nature of the policy as well as the background federal policy context. I corroborate existing research by finding that local policies especially requirement and densitybonuses are essential in driving green building certification. I also highlight the importance of federal policies (e.g. federal funding like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act – ARRA) and private actions (e.g. through improvements to the building rating system process) in driving green buildingadoption. These findings highlight that local policy, federal policy, and private actions need to work in tandem to drive green building growth. In Chapter 3, I explore a similar line of questioning, however, focusing on the associations of different energy efficiency programs with reductions in electricity and gas usage. Using the difference-indifferenceand event history modeling approaches, I find that behavioral programs are associated with the largest increases in energy reductions even when compared to financial incentive programs. I also provide a means of detecting unexpected program impacts (i.e. changes that occur at the same time as the introduction of a new technology leading to biased estimates of program impacts) using electricity andgas usage data. I find gas reductions for some electricity-only programs thereby indicating that energyreductions may have occurred in the absence of the program. I highlight here that energy efficiencyprograms have the potential to significantly reduce electricity and gas use in buildings. However, the expost evaluation of these programs need to be appropriately measured to ensure that these reductions are indeed associated with policy implementation as significant amounts of money and time is invested in program implementation. While Chapters 2 and 3 focus on the evaluation of past energy efficiency programs and policies, in Chapter 4, I focus on other considerations that need to be made when making the decision about building energy efficiency. Specifically, I focus on the incorporation of other health and climate impacts when addressing the issue of climate change in the building sector. I investigate the energy reductions,greenhouse gas and other air emission reductions, as well as the private net costs and benefits of implementing a myriad of energy efficiency measures using the case study of the state of Pennsylvania. I find significant energy reductions compared to 2017 baseline levels - 36%, 44%, 19%, and 43% reductions of electricity, gas, propane, and fuel oil. More importantly, I estimate significant social benefits of $2.4billion per year and highlight the energy efficiency measures which maximize both theprivate and social benefits for the state. In Chapter 5, I discuss overarching conclusions and some considerations for policy revealed in Chapters 2 to 4. Findings in Chapters 2 and 3, for example, show the benefits of non-economic programs and incentives in driving building energy efficiency. I corroborate the nascent research on behavioralprograms on energy reductions and recommend that utility evaluators examine non-financial program and policy approaches to reducing energy use as it also offers a low-cost alternative to promoting energy use reductions. More specifically, In Chapter 2, I learn that policy actors i.e. local and federal policy makers, as well as private bodies, need to work together in driving green building adoption. However, highlighted is the need for more transparency in ensuring that green building certifications are indeed translating toenergy reductions. In Chapter 3, I learn the importance of more robust analyses when using data-driven approaches in the energy measurement and verification process of energy efficiency programs. In Chapter 4, I find that energy efficiency measures which yield the highest private benefits may not necessarily yield the highest social benefits therefore highlighting the need for a more holistic look when making the decision between competing energy efficiency measures.",10/11/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:34,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/9792074.v1,,"/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/XS3S24P5/Adekanye - 2019 - Evaluation of Building Policies, Programs, and Potential for Energy Efficiency in the United States.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasingly, direct nuclear weapons verification proves relevant to future arms control treaties. I therefore explore the epistemology of direct nuclear weapons verification through interviews, reports, and publications on potential verification systems. I argue that within Russia, most involved in the arms control non-governmental community, consider existing verification technologies sufficient. They are noticeably caught between contradictions in their work on disarmament verification and skeptical that their efforts will influence arms control dynamics. Within direct verification of nuclear weapons (DVNW) experiments, the few vulnerability tests and technology demonstrations that occur tend to disrupt prior assumptions about verification and longstanding research trajectories within the field, triggering epistemic crises within the verification field. Shifting political and technical constraints shape many of the ideas within DVNW. Narratives that frame secrecy and certainty as direct trade-offs appear to have developed in the United States with Field Test 34 and continue to generate an underlying skepticism towards any approaches that attempt to reconcile the aims of direct weapons verification..",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Direct verification of nuclear weapons and the secrecy-certainty spectrum,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KFA8NK75,thesis,2015,"Fingerhut, Henry Alan; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",A systems framework and modeling approach to predict and manage the mental health effects of a military conflict,,,,,,"Combat-related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) poses complex challenges for policymakers that systems analysis could help elucidate. True population prevalence and future clinical need are highly uncertain, because individuals' PTSD symptomatology may fluctuate in time. Though we increasingly measure policy outcomes, outcome metrics often address direct, short-term effects, so the impact on long-term prevalence is unclear. The PTSD burden involves a diverse set of actors across domains who independently make decisions based on incomplete information. Systems analysis can indicate how these local aspects of the PTSD burden jointly impact long-term prevalence and identify leverage points for PTSD mitigation. This thesis presents a systems framework and stochastic modeling approach to predict PTSD prevalence and clinical demand over the decades following the current Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi Freedom (OIF). The system developed in this study incorporates the literature on PTSD symptom dynamics and social factors governing its recognition and treatment in order to identify the structure and dynamics of the PTSD burden. The simulation results indicate the extent to which PTSD is chronic, prevalent, and resistant to treatment. The best-case model predicts that 11-16% of OEF/OIF combat veterans will maintain a long-term need for PTSD services, and as many as 23% of OEF/OIF combat veterans will seek PTSD-related health care at least once in their lives. By controlling for symptom dynamics, model results account for a large component of the variation in empirically observed prevalence rates. Sensitivity and policy analyses show that care-seeking factors tend to have the most significant effect on long-term PTSD prevalence. Model limitations and assumptions are documented, particularly regarding symptom and care-seeking dynamics and parameter interactions, to provide the basis for future empirical and analytical work to elaborate systemic complexities underlying military mental health. The current study specifically addresses OEF/OIF combat-related PTSD, however this approach may be generalized to other populations and mental health concerns. This study has three main policymaking implications. First, study predictions regarding long-term PTSD prevalence and clinical demand can be used for clinical planning and resource allocation over time. Second, baseline model results indicate the long-term limits of current best practice PTSD mitigation efforts. Third, the study identifies effective policy levers by indicating the factors with the greatest direct impact on long-term PTSD prevalence.",2015,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 S.M.,Book Title: A systems framework and modeling approach to predict and manage the mental health effects of a military conflict,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KKA4N4EA,thesis,2015,"Chang, Michael Tse-Gene; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Performance targets for electric vehicle batteries,,,,,,"Light-duty vehicle transportation accounted for 17.2% of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2012 [95]. An important strategy for reducing CO₂ emissions emitted by light-duty vehicles is to reduce per-mile CO₂ emissions. While one approach is to improve vehicle efficiency, greater reductions in emissions can be achieved by switching from gasoline vehicles to electric vehicles, if the electric vehicles run on electricity from clean energy sources. Batteries affect the consumer adoption of electric vehicles by influencing two important vehicle characteristics: cost and driving range on a single charge. The cost of the battery is a significant fraction of total vehicle cost, and the battery's energy capacity determines driving range. To lower battery costs and improve battery energy capacity, further research is needed. To guide such research, several organizations have created performance targets for batteries, including the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and the US Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC). The goal of this thesis is to assess these performance targets based on real-world vehicle performance. A method is developed for estimating the energy requirements of personal vehicle travel, which improves upon previous methods by accounting for per-trip variation of vehicle energy consumption and analyzing data with wider geographic scope. The method consists of a model of battery-to-wheel vehicle energy consumption and a conditional bootstrap procedure for combining GPS travel data with large-scale data from the US National Household Travel Survey. The research finds that the distribution of energy requirements for US vehicle-trips and vehicle-days (the sum of all trips taken in a day) has a heavy tail, namely that a small proportion of long trips accounts for a disproportionately large amount of energy consumption. Current electric vehicle batteries (2011 Nissan Leaf) can satisfy 83% of vehicle-days, which account for 53% of all energy consumed in personal vehicle travel, while batteries that meet the performance targets can satisfy 98 to 99% of vehicle-days, which account for 90 to 96% of energy. These results allow for a quantification of the benefits of meeting performance targets for battery energy capacity, which can help assess technology readiness and guide allocation of research funding.",2015,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Performance targets for electric vehicle batteries,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KKEKWNE7,thesis,2012,"Gordon, Timothy D.",Secondary Organic Aerosol from On- and Off-Road Combustion Emissions: Scientific and Policy Perspectives,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Secondary_Organic_Aerosol_from_On-_and_Off-Road_Combustion_Emissions_Scientific_and_Policy_Perspectives/6721430/1,"Combustion emissions from on-road sources such as light duty gasoline vehicles (LDGV), medium duty diesel vehicles (MDDV) and heavy duty diesel vehicles (HDDV) as well as small off-road engines (SORE) such those used in lawn and garden equipment are a major source of fine particulate matter (PM) pollution in the ambient atmosphere. Existing regulations have restricted direct PM emissions, especially for on-road sources; however, recent studies suggest that organic PM formed from the photo-oxidation of gaseous precursor emissions—so-called secondary organic aerosol (SOA)—contributes at least as much to the overall PM burden as PM “emitted from the tailpipe.” A major limitation of many of these studies is that they attempt to induce from the behavior of simple emission surrogates (e.g., vaporized whole fuel) the behavior of actual combustion emissions from real world sources. This research investigates combustion emissions directly. The primary gas- and particle-phase emissions, SOA production and SOA yields from a range of different on-road and off-road combustion sources were characterized. LDGV, MDDV and HDDV were driven on chassis dynamometers over realistic, urban driving cycles. Off-road sources, including 2- and 4-stroke lawn and garden equipment and a diesel transportation refrigeration unit were tested using engine dynamometers operated over certification cycles. For nearly all gasoline engines (LDGV and SOREs), photo-oxidizing dilute combustion emissions for 3 hours produced at least as much SOA as the directly emitted primary PM. SOA increased net PM production for LDGV by a factor of 1-10, depending on the vehicle emission standard. SOA yields were found to increase with newer vehicles, which have lower primary emissions. SOA for diesel vehicles, while still large on an absolute basis, was a smaller fractionof the primary PM emissions (between 10-30%), due to the very high elemental carbon (EC) emissions from vehicles without diesel particulate filters (DPF). Aftertreatment systems utilizing a DPF and a diesel oxidation catalyst essentially eliminated primary PM and SOA. Among the off-road sources, SOA from 2-stroke emissions increased the net PM by roughly a factor of 2. Primary emission and SOA production factors from the various combustion sources tested in this work were combined with fuel consumption data for California’s South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) to determine the impact on the aggregate PM from on- and off-road sources in the region. These estimated impacts were compared to the PM values derived from the regulatory models EMFAC and OFFROAD. Our data indicate that PM from on-road gasoline sources is significantly under-represented by existing emissions models due to the dominant role of SOA. When SOA production is included, newer LDGV are one of the largest sources of PM in SoCAB. Furthermore, LDGV will become an even more important PM source once existing regulations requiring DPF retrofits on both on- and off-road diesel sources are implemented over the next few years. While on-road diesel vehicles are currently an important source of PM based on total fuel consumption, LDGV are responsible for a larger fraction of total PM. The primary and secondary PM contribution of off-road sources also appear to be high, but the magnitude remains highly uncertain, pending further experimental data. Evidence is presented that suggests that existing models may dramatically overpredict primary PM emissions from off-road sources",8/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Secondary Organic Aerosol from On- and Off-Road Combustion Emissions,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721430.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, not much is known about their influence, if any, on technology trajectories. This dissertation explores the relationship between the burst of the telecommunications bubble and the rate and direction of innovation of United States (U.S.) inventors in optoelectronics, a technology pivotal to the telecommunications industry. Leveraging a hand-built dataset of 790 inventor CVs, we analyze optoelectronics’ inventor market shifts and associated innovation outcomes before, during, and after the burst of the telecommunications bubble. We find that the burst of the bubble disproportionately reduced inventor innovation in the rest of the field compared to the emerging general purpose technology (GPT) enabler. An increase in the emerging GPT-enabler post-burst is driven by Super Star inventors (top 1.5% both by cumulative patents and annual patenting pre-bubble) that switch markets applications post-burst out of diversified firms with telecommunications divisions and into firms focused exclusively on telecommunications. These Super Stars continue an increase in integration patenting that was driven during the bubble by Non Stars who left a period of unemployment, other markets and academia and went into firms focused on telecommunications and diversified firms with telecommunications divisions. These superstars do not act in an institutional vacuum, however. There were several factors that influenced the growth of innovation in optoelectronics. This dissertation explores the ways vi that the location of research in different kinds of organizations, government funding and government regulation have combined to influence innovation worldwide in optoelectronics. Analyzing patenting patterns in optoelectronics between 1955 and 2010, we identify the most influential firms, government agencies and individuals responsible for leading innovation in this field. We use archival data on firms’ decisions, firms’ market applications and collect oral histories on key individuals. We find evidence for co-operation and competition between academia and industry in the early years. We also find that the most prolific firms are not the most influential. In addition, government regulation influenced innovation in at least two unexpected ways: by limiting U.S. permanent residents from defense applications of the technology and by inspiring new ventures when mergers were delayed by Department of Justice investigations. This dissertation contributes to research on innovation and mobility, and to academic discourse on the relationship between business cycles and technology trajectories. Previous research in the field of mobility and innovation that has used patent data to estimate mobility is limited by inventors only showing up in patent data if they patent after they move, thus biasing the observed sample. CV data disentangles the relationship between mobility and patenting. With respect to business cycles, our results suggest that both non-stars and super-stars may have important roles in pushing innovation frontiers during different parts of the business cycle. While super-stars advance the emerging GPT enabler during resource-constrained parts of the business cycle, they continue the efforts of non-stars during less constrained times. This suggests there may be a role for government in supporting emerging-GPT-enabler innovations during economic downturns.",5/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,Following the Light,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716999.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this thesis, we show that there can be huge benefits to the alternative scheme, multi-network access (MNA), where a mobile device may use the infrastructure owned by any one of multiple network operators, at any point in space and time.MNA can greatly improve the spectral efficiency of cellular networks. Given uniformly distributed tower location, MNA can increase network capacity by over 50% without additional infrastructure or spectrum; or equivalently, it can reduce infrastructure and spectrum spending each by 20% to produce the same capacity. The benefit of MNA is accessible - it does not require large separation distance between the transmitters belonging to different network operators, nor does it require many non-colocated transmitters. Moreover, colocation does not necessarily negate the benefit of MNA; they can be deployed together to achieve even greater cost efficiency.The economic impact of MNA on individual network operators is a result of both business decisions and technical parameters. When mobile network operators (MNOs) participate in MNA, the distribution of traffic volumes and the associated revenue among partner MNOs with MNA is not necessarily equal to that without MNA, and is not necessarily commensurate with the distribution of investment on infrastructure and spectrum resources among partner MNOs. There exists MNA arrangements that make all stakeholders, including consumers, better off; exactly how these benefits are distributed among all stakeholders comes down to negotiations.MNA-capable users can benefit from higher-layer protocols and features that enable the fast switching between networks without disruption to ongoing sessions and the better utilization of multiple networks. Flow-level migration allows fine-grained load balancing and QoS matching for multihomed devices running heterogeneous applications. Locators based on directed-acyclic-graphs allow quick response to link failure and enhances the resiliency of multihomed hosts and networks. Self-certifying identifiers facilitate authentication of migration signaling messages and helps reduce handoff latency.MNA already exists today in the form of a multi-operator mobile virtual network operator (MO-MVNO) like Google Fi, and there are signs of growing momentum in other forms such as through dual-SIM phones. The advent of 5G and network slicing thanks to software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) technologies will make MNA even more relevant in the future. MNA may have a profound impact on our wireless internet services by bringing a fundamental shift in control from service providers to end users. Consumers will no longer be limited by a single service provider in price, coverage, performance and customer service, and can always receive the service that best meets current needs. While practical barriers to MNA remain, the potential economic and social benefits provide strong incentives for its consideration.",1/22/20,5/20/25 15:32,5/20/25 15:32,5/20/25 15:32,,,,,,,Multi-Network Access,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/11568666.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/3BLQXM5E/Zhang - 2020 - Multi-Network Access How It Can Benefit Network Operators and Consumers Alike.pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While AM has great potential to address HX manufacturing challenges, it also presents cost and environmental challenges. In Chapter 2, I evaluate laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AM costs for an HX design for concentrating solar power (CSP) with molten salt thermal storage using process-based cost modeling (PBCM). I use this PBCM to identify HX design and LPBF process changes that reduce projected HX cost from $750/kW-th to $220/kW-th. I also identify pathways to further reduce projected cost to $140-160/kW-th by leveraging cutting-edge advances in LPBF technology. In Chapter 3, I extend the PBCM to evaluate alternative CSP HX designs and to enable co-optimization of cost and performance for HX designs for other clean energy applications. In Chapter 4, I characterize the impact of applying productivity improvement strategies for HX on LPBF part cost, speed, and quality via expert elicitation. I find that experts believe that increasing the part footprint is more detrimental to print success than increasing part height. Experts also believe that beam shaping is expected to provide limited print time improvement while improving part quality, whereas going from one to two lasers is expected to provide a moderate print time improvement but degrade part quality. I incorporate expert quantitative insights into the Chapter 2 PBCM and show that the uncertainty in build success rates for large parts dominates expected cost reductions from laser beam shaping or multi laser printing. In Chapter 5, I develop a framework to track metal mass flows through the AM process that comprehensively accounts for sources of uncertainty to enable comparison of various powder production processes. Through a case study of SS316 gas atomization and LPBF, I find that higher AM quality powder yields significantly reduced AM cumulative energy demand (CED), even within the range typical for gas atomization. I also find that for CED of a printed part, AM powder CED impacts part CED less than LPBF part acceptance rate.",2023,5/20/25 15:49,5/20/25 15:49,5/20/25 15:49,14971051 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 14971051 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,/new; Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Directed acyclic graphs (DAG), also called Bayesian networks, provide a natural way to conceptualize these systems. In contrast, regression modeling can provide strong evidence for the local, causal neighborhood of an outcome within the causal system, butproviding structure for the larger system is challenging with regression. Despite its value as exploratory data analysis or in conjunction with regression models to refine causal understanding, methods for estimating the causal structure underlying a dataset, causal discovery, are rare in fields such as epidemiology, possibly due to the difficulty handling data with continuous and discrete random variables.This thesis focuses on developing a causal discovery method for researchers whose data typically are comprised of both discrete and continuous variables. Its primarycontribution is the development of an estimator for graph divergence, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the full, joint distribution and the Bayesian factorizationindicated by a DAG. Graph divergence is a generalization of conditional mutual information: it quantifies the ?t of a DAG to the data, with greater divergence indicating worse ?t and a divergence of zero indicating a perfect characterization ofthe conditional independence relationships among the variables. Its nearest neighbor approach gives the estimator the capability to handle mixed data. We show that the estimator is consistent and its convergence separately for the continuous and discrete case under some assumptions.Last, we demonstrate a way to use graph divergence with a greedy Markov equivalence search algorithm in practice. Though this work is not complete, we estimate causal relationships between personal demographics, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis among men who have sex with men (MSM) on the American Men's Internet Survey data.

While the abundant potential of renewable energy such as solar and wind provides a real opportunity for sustainability, their intermittency and uncertainty present a daunting operating challenge. This thesis aims to develop analytical models, deployable algorithms, and real systems to enable efficient integration of renewable energy into complex distributed systems with limited information. The first thrust of the thesis is to make IT systems more sustainable by facilitating the integration of renewable energy into these systems. IT represents the fastest growing sectors in energy usage and greenhouse gas pollution. Over the last decade there are dramatic improvements in the energy efficiency of IT systems, but the efficiency improvements do not necessarily lead to reduction in energy consumption because more servers are demanded. Further, little effort has been put in making IT more sustainable, and most of the improvements are from improved ""engineering"" rather than improved ""algorithms"". In contrast, my work focuses on developing algorithms with rigorous theoretical analysis that improve the sustainability of IT. In particular, this thesis seeks to exploit the flexibilities of cloud workloads both (i) in time by scheduling delay-tolerant workloads and (ii) in space by routing requests to geographically diverse data centers. These opportunities allow data centers to adaptively respond to renewable availability, varying cooling efficiency, and fluctuating energy prices, while still meeting performance requirements. The design of the enabling algorithms is however very challenging because of limited information, non-smooth objective functions and the need for distributed control. Novel distributed algorithms are developed with theoretically provable guarantees to enable the ""follow the renewables"" routing. Moving from theory to practice, I helped HP design and implement industry's first Net-zero Energy Data Center. The second thrust of this thesis is to use IT systems to improve the sustainability and efficiency of our energy infrastructure through data center demand response. The main challenges as we integrate more renewable sources to the existing power grid come from the fluctuation and unpredictability of renewable generation. Although energy storage and reserves can potentially solve the issues, they are very costly. One promising alternative is to make the cloud data centers demand responsive. The potential of such an approach is huge. To realize this potential, we need adaptive and distributed control of cloud data centers and new electricity market designs for distributed electricity resources. My work is progressing in both directions. In particular, I have designed online algorithms with theoretically guaranteed performance for data center operators to deal with uncertainties under popular demand response programs. Based on local control rules of customers, I have further designed new pricing schemes for demand response to align the interests of customers, utility companies, and the society to improve social welfare.",2014,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,California Institute of Technology,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Sustainable IT and IT for Sustainability ISBN: 9781303963162,,,,,Computer science; Sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L5PERL9L,thesis,2015,"Zhang, Biao; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Decision analysis of novel point-of-care diagnostics for Pediatric Pneumonia: implementation in Developing countries with tiered healthcare systems,,,,,,"Pediatric Pneumonia (PNA) is the single leading cause of death in children under five, accounting for 19% of all childhood deaths worldwide. Due to severe resource constraints on healthcare, the global burden of the disease in children is disproportionately shared by developing countries. In particular, India, having the highest incidence rate of PNA, accounts for more than 30% of the world's neonatal deaths from pneumonia every year. The three-tier referral systems, shared by many other developing countries, has introduced inefficiencies into delivering appropriate healthcare to patients in need. Point-of-care (POC) diagnostics is a type of tool used to assist physicians to make clinical decisions. Its key advantage include the quick turnaround of results, low cost and high diagnostic power could potentially improve India's pressing situation due to pneumonia. Since the disease progresses quickly in infants and babies and transportation of patients within the healthcare system is time consuming, POC diagnostic is crucial in lowering both the mortality of children with pneumonia and the cost of treating PNA. To this effect, we investigate the potential impact of POC diagnostics when implemented in a three-tier referral system. Using India as a case country, I construct a decision tree model that evaluates cost, mortality, and the combined cost-effectiveness in Tree-Age software as a framework which evaluates five implementation strategies of a POC diagnostic for PNA within the Indian public healthcare system. The strategies reflect various prescription decisions and referral patterns in current medical practice in India. I concluded that (1) the diagnostic will result in both higher cost and mortality in areas where the practice is to provide all patients antibiotics and thus not recommended, (2) the diagnostic is very likely to achieve lower cost and mortality when patients do not always receive antibiotics and sometimes are given only symptom-relieving drugs and thus recommended, (3) the diagnostic has great potential in generating savings by limiting patients from being transported to urban hospitals, (4) when dual diagnostic is employed combining POC diagnostics and X-ray, confirming positive cases from the diagnostic by X-ray results in lower cost and confirming negative cases results in lower mortality and (5) the diagnostic can save resources and benefit health outcomes and should be implemented in places where X-ray is not available.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Decision analysis of novel point-of-care diagnostics for Pediatric Pneumonia,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Decision analysis of novel point-of-care diagnostics for Pediatric Pneumonia : implementation in Developing countries with tiered healthcare systems,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation examines near future battery technology and cost by (1) validating existing physics-based battery performance models using laboratory testing and manufacturer specifications, (2) constructing battery design optimization and production cost models to identify the least-cost design and investigating how key design-decision variables affect performance and cost for a variety of vehicle power and energy requirements, and (3) conducting expert elicitation on future battery costs and the key factors that drive cost. The validation, cost, and optimization modeling work use LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2/LixC6 (NMC-G) as the chemistry of choice. Validation results of Battery Design Studio™ (BDS) a Li-ion battery modeling software indicated that BDS predictions of total energy delivered under our constant C-rate battery discharge tests are within 6.5% of laboratory measurements for a full discharge and within 2.8% when a 60% state of charge window is considered. Once validated, BDS is used to develop a power meta-model that predicts the 10–sec power capability of a cell design as a function of its capacity (Ah) and cathode coating thickness (microns). The production cost model is a process-based model and is constructed adopting process step information from existing literature. Subsequently, an optimization model is developed which estimates the cheapest cost battery pack design for a set of five different electrified vehicles (EVs) whereby the role of design-decision variables like cathode coating thickness is investigated among others. The energy and power requirements for the EVs, used as constraints in the optimization model, are calculated using the Powertrain Systems Analysis Toolkit (PSAT). Battery pack costs calculated are in the range of costs reported in the literature. Results indicate that higher capacity cells manufactured using higher electrode coating thicknesses can decrease manufacturing costs by 5-8%. Results suggest that economies of scale can be reached at a plant size of about 200MWh. Expert elicitation indicates that a variation of NMC-G is likely to be the cheaper cell-chemistry by 2018 with no major technological breakthroughs. Some experts also expect manufacturing improvements resulting in higher electrode coating thicknesses and cell capacities expected by 2018.",12/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721202.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L9UYCFW9,thesis,2022,"Bertolotti, Paolo; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Inference and diffusion in networks,,,,,,"Networks provide a powerful and unified framework to study complex systems. By abstracting systems down to entities and their connections, network models provide insight into the structure and dynamics of critical systems across multiple domains. In this thesis, we study diffusion in social networks. Diffusion through networked systems corresponds to numerous consequential processes, and we focus on epidemic spread and information diffusion. We study these processes by applying and extending ideas from statistical inference. Inference, which focuses on estimation, testing, and uncertainty quantification, provides the mathematical tools to learn from data rigorously. This thesis utilizes both theory and data in order to address several real-world challenges. In the first chapter, we study epidemic spread and consider the problem of identifying infected individuals in a population of size N. We introduce an approach that uses significantly fewer than N tests when infection prevalence is low. Our approach utilizes network structure to improve the performance of a classical approach called group testing. In the second chapter, we derive the performance of the most common form of group testing, Dorfman testing, under imperfect tests. We derive the full distribution of the number of tests needed, the number of false negatives, and the number of false positives, taking into account the conditions faced by medical practitioners. In the third chapter, we study information diffusion and introduce a statistical testing framework to identify cascades in network data. We define a test statistic that distinguishes between large, meaningful branches and the small branches formed during normal periods, and apply our statistic to identify information cascades in call detail record data. In the fourth chapter, we study the social network effects of drone strikes, focusing on information and physical diffusion around strikes. Utilizing a dataset of over 12 billion call detail records, we systematically analyze the impact of 74 U.S. drone strikes on communication and mobility in Yemen between 2010 and 2012.",2022,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Inference and diffusion in networks ISBN: 9781349471454,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These technologies have enabled us to recognize many forms of community—from close knit social groups to individuals who merely co-habit public spaces—and to support interaction with each other in novel ways. The notion that modern digital technology holds promises of democratization by expanding access to information and broadening modes of knowledge production often fails to acknowledge that these benefits rely upon devices and infrastructure whose availability reflect socioeconomic contours; that the technologies that enable information access can also reinforce rather than obviate marginality due to barriers to access and suitability. This assessment points to opportunities for better understanding and better designing technologies for the marginalized or dispossessed. The research presented in this dissertation discusses the findings from empirical, theoretical, and design based investigations of technology use with the urban homeless. The empirical work provides a foundation for understanding current technology practices among the homeless and their care providers. The theoretical investigation develops Deweyan publics as a novel frame for participatory design. The design-based investigation presents findings from the design and deployment of the Community Resource Messenger at a shelter for homeless mothers.

The country is emblematic of this tension, having experienced more coups than any other country in the last century, yet also being considered one of the eight ""East Asian Miracles"" and a major destination for foreign direct investment. Through three papers, the thesis examines how businesses and governments can navigate political turmoil to enhance high-tech innovation. The first paper investigates why firms continue to invest in R&amp;D amidst political turmoil. The study uses a unique firm R&amp;D survey to explore this question and finds that R&amp;D investment may increase as it is flexible and redeployable once political uncertainty is more clarified. To further mitigate the risks from political uncertainty, firms invest their R&amp;D in functions that are more reversible and in sectors that have more potential returns from innovation. The second paper explores how multinational corporations (MNCs) adjust their innovation activities differently than domestic firms when their target country is facing turmoil. The study finds that although MNCs are associated with increased R&amp;D investment after the coup, their rate of associated increase is lower than that of domestic firms. MNCs from countries with more politically-oriented business cultures were also associated with less R&amp;D investment after the coup. The third paper explores how governments sustain and adapt the development of science and technology (S&amp;T) systems to political events. The study finds that officials are not just able to maintain public STI institutions, investments, and policies, but they are even able to enhance their efforts in certain instances. The study uncovers two key theoretical constructs that help explain this unexpected phenomenon: bureaucratic expansion and bureaucratic adaptation. Overall, this thesis identifies ways in which stakeholders in an innovation ecosystem can more effectively handle the challenges and opportunities presented by political transitions. It offers insights that can guide stakeholders in making informed decisions and taking calculated risks amidst such turmoil. This research can be particularly beneficial to economies that aim to emerge from the middleincome gap by leveraging science, technology, and innovation but face adverse conditions such as political uncertainty and violence. By providing a roadmap for how Thai stakeholders have navigated such challenges, this thesis can help Thailand and similar other economies unlock their full potential and achieve sustained growth and development.",2023,5/20/25 15:35,5/20/25 15:35,5/20/25 15:35,3147106 Bytes,,,,,,Navigating Political Change,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 3147106 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Organizational Behavioral Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LEZBUBN3,thesis,2015,"Oh, Suzie",Education and Challenges for North Korean Defector Youth in South Korea,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1696750651?pq-origsite=primo,"Despite the South Korean government’s North Korean defector resettlement support system that aims to provide for a smooth transition into a new society, North Korean defectors fail to successfully adjust and thrive in their new environment. High unemployment rates and high drop out rate from school among North Korean defectors are only a few indicators that attest to social maladjustment. This thesis will look into the unique challenges North Korean defector youth face in the South Korean education system and how the South Korean government’s assistance lacks to provide the support North Korean youth need in this critical period of social transition and educational development. After establishing that existing scholarship overwhelmingly points to mental/psychological and sociocultural factors stemming from past experiences as having a significant effect on defectors’ adjustment to South Korea, this thesis will the examine the experiences and the challenges that defector youth face within the South Korean education system. By uncovering the deficiencies in South Korean resettlement policies in addressing these psychological and sociocultural factors within education and support for defector youth, this thesis will argue that despite the varying levels of traumatic experiences that affect the intellectual and social development of North Korean defector youth before and after coming to South Korea, south Korean laws and policies lack a centralized education system, long-term support, expertise and support for specialized programs show the government’s inability to address the challenges of that defector youth face adjusting to South Korean society. Data for this study comes largely from statistics from the South Korean government and organizations such as the Korean Educational Development Institute, Ministry of Unification and the North Korean Refugees Foundation, previous academic studies on the experiences of North Korean defectors, and documentation of South Korean resettlement policy and laws. Additional insight and narratives from the researcher’s informal interviews conducted with four defector students will be used to further illustrate the difficult reality defector youth face. These students attend the Jangdaehyun School, an alternative Christian boarding school for North Korean defectors located in Busan, South Korea. The principal of the school, Professor Changho Lim was also interviewed for additional insight on the need and significance of alternative education for defector youth.

The country is expected to become a net oil importer by the year 2011. To encourage renewable energy development and relieve the country’s emerging oil dependence, in 2006 the government mandated blending 5% palm-oil biodiesel in petroleum diesel. Malaysia produced 16 million tonnes of palm oil in 2007, mainly for food use. This study addresses maximizing bioenergy use from oil-palm to support Malaysia’s energy initiative while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions from land use change. When converting primary and secondary forests to oil-palm plantations between 270 - 530 g and 120 -190 g CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) per MJ of biodiesel produced, respectively, is released. However, converting degraded lands results in the capture of between 23 to 85 g CO2-eq per MJ of biodiesel produced. Using various combinations of land types, Malaysia could meet the 5% biodiesel target with a net GHG savings of about 1.03 million tonnes (4.9% of the transportation sector’s diesel emissions) when accounting for the emissions savings from the diesel fuel displaced. Fossil fuels contributed about 93% to Malaysia’s electricity generation mix and emit about 65 million tonnes (Mt) or 36% of the country’s 2010 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The government has set a target to install 330 MW biomass electricity by 2015, which is hoped to avoid 1.3 Mt of GHG emissions annually. The availability of seven types of biomass residues in Peninsular Malaysia is estimated based on residues-to-product ratio, recoverability and accessibility factor and other competing uses. It was found that there are approximately 12.2 Mt/yr of residues. Oil-palm residues contribute about 77% to the total availability with rice and forestry residues at 17%. Electricity from biomass can be produced via direct combustion in dedicated power plants or co-fired with coal. The co-firing of the residues at four existing coal plants in Peninsular Malaysia was modeled to minimize cost or GHG emissions. It is found that Malaysia can meet the 330 MW biomass electricity target via co-firing with a cost reduction of about $24 million compared to 100% coal. Optimal GHG reduction for co-firing was found to be 17 Mt lower than 100% coal at a cost of carbon mitigation (COM) of about $22.50/t CO2-eq mitigated. This COM is lower than an implied COM under the newly introduced levy on heavy electricity users in Malaysia. Gasoline consumed roughly 370 PJ of energy in Malaysia's transportation sector in 2009. Ethanol can be blended with gasoline up to 10% by volume in most vehicles. Peninsular Malaysia's 12.2 Mt/yr of agro-forestry residues can be used for potentially producing 3.8 billion liters ethanol annually. Using a large scale mixed-integer linear optimization, it is found that if Malaysia introduces a 10% ethanol-gasoline blend (E10), approximately 2.9 Mt (24%) of the residues would be used at $5.4 million more cost compared to 100% gasoline (reference case) estimated at $5.2 billion/yr. In the E10 scenario, all cities receive 10% ethanol altogether producing 900 million liters of ethanol. The GHG emissions for 100% gasoline is estimated at 26.4 Mt/yr. The minimum GHG emissions if E10 is implemented in Peninsular Malaysia was found to be 24.5 Mt, 2.0 Mt lower than 100% gasoline, which implies a $4.70/t CO2-eq cost of carbon mitigation (COM). Since only 24% of the available residues are used to produce the E10, the possibility of producing the E10 and electricity via co-firing with coal simultaneously was investigated. This is done by combining the fuel (gasoline/E10) model with the electricity (coal-only/co-firing) model. The costs of the reference case combined scenario (100% gasoline and 100% coal) is estimated at $6.3 billion/yr and emits 63 Mt/yr of GHG emissions. The minimum cost for producing the E10 and co-firing is found to be $30 million lower than the combined reference case. This is achieved by using 5.9 Mt of residues. The minimum GHG emissions level obtained is 17 Mt lower implying a COM of $19.00/t CO2-eq mitigated. The findings in this research are used to recommend policies for mitigating GHG emissions impacts from the growth of palm oil use in the transportation sector. Policy recommendations are also discussed to ensure a successful implementation of co-firing of biomass and the production of E10 by ensuring a guaranteed supply of residues and financing the high capital cost of the renewable energy program.",8/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,GHG Emissions and Costs of Developing Biomass Energy in Malaysia,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6718319.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, the least developed countries struggle with inadequate access to modern agricultural, water, and energy technologies to provide food efficiently and securely. This thesis aims to identify and quantify food production impacts on energy and water consumption via case studies in the United States and East Africa. In both cases, I use integrated biophysical models to estimate the effects of food production (e.g., chicken broiler meat and irrigated crop yields) on energy and water resources consumption using climatological data inputs. For the case study in East Africa, I also assessed the financial viability of pressurized irrigation on a subnational level. Findings suggest that projected future climate change temperatures by mid-century will increase energy demand for cooling, reduce energy demand for heating, and substantially increase water withdrawals for evaporative cooling for industrial chicken broiler production in the Eastern U.S. The results for the case in East Africa indicate that the techno-economic potential of small-scale pressurized irrigation is highest for horticulture, maize, and potato crops grown with improved seeds and at least moderate fertility levels. My results suggest that food production impacts on energy and water demand are climate and site (or geography) dependent. These factors' relative importance depends on operational practices (e.g., input selection), technology types and costs, and fuel prices.",2022,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:43,5537831 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 5537831 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,90799 Environmental Engineering not elsewhere classified; FOS: Environmental engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LHSGRGK7,thesis,2010,"Funahashi, Yoshifuru; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Comparative analysis of aviation safety information feedback systems,,,,,,"In the aviation system, there are several feedback systems to prevent an accident. First of all, the accident and serious incident reporting and investigation system is established by the Chicago Convention. In general, once an accident or a serious incident occurs, it must be reported to the Investigation Authority in the state where the event occurred. The Investigation Authority which receives the report conducts the investigation of the event. Then, based on the probable causes identified, the Investigation Authority issues the recommendations to the Civil Aviation Authority. Next, the Civil Aviation Authority which receives the recommendations takes corrective actions, including rule-making, to prevent the recurrence of the event. This feedback system ensures that an accident with the same causes will not occur again. The feedback system described above can be considered a reactive approach. There are also proactive feedback systems to prevent an accident. In order to identify hazards that could potentially lead to an accident, the contracting states of the Convention have mandatory reporting systems for incidents. In addition, some contracting states even have voluntary reporting systems for safety-related occurrences not limited to formally defined incidents. If these feedback systems are utilized to the full extent. they could help in reducing the accident rate. This thesis, aiming at offering insights for responsible authorities in contracting states of the Chicago Convention to improve their aviation safety information feedback systems, conducted a comparative analysis of the feedback systems in four contracting states of the Chicago Convention: the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Japan. This thesis examined both mandatory reporting systems and voluntary reporting systems in each state. Furthermore, this thesis examined the rule-making process in each Civil Aviation Authority as part of the feedback systems. This thesis identified several differences in the feedback systems in the four states. In particular, this thesis identified a relatively larger number of differences in voluntary reporting systems than in mandatory reporting systems. On the other hand, as regards the rulemaking process, this thesis showed that there are no substantial differences.",2010,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: Comparative analysis of aviation safety information feedback systems,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LLU47PB4,thesis,2012,"Kishimoto, Paul Natsuo; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program","Passenger transport in China under climate constraints: general equilibrium analysis, uncertainty, and policy",,,,,,"Vehicle sales and road travel volume in China have grown rapidly in recent years, and with them energy demand, greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution. Aviation and rail travel have also grown, while ceding a large share to private vehicles. What path will household transport demand in China take in the future? How might it interact with policies which limit greenhouse gases, and what are the implications for energy use, the environment and the economy? To contribute policy insights and a foundation for future study in this area, I undertake a new calibration of the Chinese household transport sector in the MIT Emissions Prediction & Policy Analysis (EPPA) computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, implementing income elasticities of demand for vehicle travel and vehicle stock growth based on historical data. To bracket uncertainty in the literature, I impose three scenarios of future growth in demand for purchased (air, rail and marine) and vehicle modes. These are explored under a no-policy baseline, a climate-stabilization policy, and with a policy that extends the emissions-intensity goal of China's Twelfth Five-Year Plan-both policies are modelled as caps creating prices on carbon. Examining the results, I find that trends in growth are only modesty affected by policy continuing present energy-intensity goals, with small decreases in travel activity and energy intensity of vehicles combining for a reduction in refined oil use; such a policy has modest cost and affects household transport less than other sectors. In contrast, my results show that a stringent emissions cap has large impacts on vehicle efficiency, limits vehicle ownership and general travel activity levels. Compared to the no-policy baseline, a smaller vehicle fleet (250 million total, or 200 per 1000 capita). Sixteen percent of the fleet is new energy vehicles (plug-in hybrid-electrics), while total refined oil use increases by 2050 to nearly three times its 2010 level. However, these effects come with a reduction in total primary energy as the policy is introduced, and large costs economy-wide. Chinese national and municipal policies include objectives of promoting vehicle ownership and mobility on the one hand, and of reducing dependence on carbon-intensive refined oil on the other. My findings illustrate that these goals are at odds, and offer inputs to policy design related to vehicle sales, public transit, congestion, pollution and energy security.",2012,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,Passenger transport in China under climate constraints,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2012 S.M.,"Book Title: Passenger transport in China under climate constraints : general equilibrium analysis, uncertainty, and policy",,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LRC63B6C,thesis,2015,"Zoepf, Stephen M.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management","Plug-in vehicles and carsharing: user preferences, energy consumption and potential for growth",,,,,,"Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) are seen as a key pathway to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in transportation, yet their sales are under 1% of new cars despite large incentives. Carsharing, a market where consumers rent vehicles for short durations, is a low-risk way for consumers to use Plug-In Electric Vehicles for their travel needs without a large financial commitment. However, deployment of PEVs in carsharing depends on three key factors: (1) consumer acceptance of PEVs for rental trips, (2) the ability of carsharing providers to manage technical limitations of PEVs, and (3) that real-world energy consumption of PEVs meets expectations. To explore the feasibility of PEV deployment in carsharing, this dissertation incorporates a Mixed-Integer Programming and simulation of the assignment of trips and vehicles, and a Hybrid Choice Model of carsharing user preferences. This dissertation's primary contributions consist of the combination of Hybrid Choice Models with a Structural Topic Model to incorporate respondent comments, a two-level representation of the assignment problem faced by carsharing providers in allocating trips to vehicles and locating vehicles, a case study of PEV deployment in Boston, and analysis of real-world energy consumption of two fleets of PEVs. Results suggest that a large fraction of round-trip carsharing fleets could be converted to PEVs, simultaneously increasing profitability and reducing gasoline consumption, and some benefits can be captured using simple heuristics. However, current user attitudes towards PEVs in carsharing vary widely, and while carsharing exposes many users to hybrids, few have tried PEVs.",2015,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,Plug-in vehicles and carsharing,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology, Management, and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 Ph.D.,"Book Title: Plug-in vehicles and carsharing : user preferences, energy consumption and potential for growth",,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LS28RGFL,thesis,2011,"Kushwaha, Pooja S.",Development of Knowledge Management Model for a Management Institute,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2314269086?pq-origsite=primo,"As the world moves towards a “knowledge based economy”, knowledge is increasingly being considered as the main driver of this economy. The success of economies in the future shall be based on how companies or organizations acquire, use, and leverage knowledge effectively. However, most organizations tend to over-emphasize on systems and tools, rather than on the core component that is knowledge sharing within the organization. Knowledge management is vital in knowledge-based organizations such as universities, since the majority of the students are knowledge seekers. The principles of knowledge management (KM) are widely acknowledged and have been developed over the last 50 years, especially in such disciplines as management science, sociology, and construction. Whilst knowledge management (KM) is still an evolving practice, specific emphasis is now taking place on securing leverage through knowledgecontext, interpretation, transfer, and reflection. Knowledge-based economies are increasingly reliant upon their intellectual capital (IC) cognizant of: the Information Technology (IT) revolution; expanding information society; the increased importance of knowledge; and the congruence and emergence of innovation through the application of KM practices. However, little work in the remit of KM has been evidenced in the Educational Institutes the omission of which is the focus of this research. There is a paradigm shift in the teaching methodology and none of the management 4 institutes rely on talk and chalk method and are now using case methodology or presentations as their teaching tools. In today’s digital scenario faculty are more focused on learning rather than teaching and to encompass learning, faculty are more like a facilitator for the students. Knowledge management helped faculty to grow as a good teacher, researcher as well as facilitator and it is fruitful for students to gain multidisciplinary knowledge which help them in their better employability in the growing competition and fast moving digital world. Educational institutions play a key role in knowledge creation. The explicit knowledge that student’s gain is embedded in their minds and constitutes the storehouse of an individual’s intellectual capital. In order to utilize all the benefits of KM, there is an utter need to develop a strong fundamental model for KM which in common can be implemented in different management institutes with flexibility for minor changes as per the individual institute’s requirements. In an educational set up, effective knowledge management ensures that academics are able to realize and develop their potential to the fullest. The KM model should be such that it can integrate the entire management education with uniform goals of mutual growth and imparting best education to the generation next. In order to understand the subject in more than 100 referred articles from various journals; magazines and websites are used for literature review and all the insights from them are used for designing questionnaire. The questionnaire is validated from the panel of experts as per the proven guidelines and procedures. Relevant data was collected from 250 faculty members from different Management Institutes in Indore from a short period of time. Different proven analysis processes were carried on the data leading to 3 factors related to Knowledge management implementation. Finding is also validated using content and criteria validation tests. Finally proposed knowledge management model is developed for Management Institutions and implications are coined for academicians as well as industry professionals.This research must be an attempt to develop framework model of Knowledge Management which is not at all developed in educational institutions in India but there is die need for managing knowledge of knowledge workers.",2011,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Development of Knowledge Management Model for a Management Institute ISBN: 9781088387825,,,,,Information science; Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the re-introduction of democracy and open society in the post-socialist region, educational borrowing has become one of the key strategies in the rebuilding and reformation of post-socialist education systems. While the process of educational borrowing is not a new phenomenon, the role of local and national governments' involvement has changed as multiple agencies, ranging from international NGOs to semi-governmental organizations (such as the World Bank), have become involved in the development and implementation of educational reform processes. The provision of ECE has become a critical catalyst to promote stability within transitioning countries, as funding for these programs provides an important site for foreign intervention due to the intrinsic value offered to parents, along with the perceived neutrality of ECE. The study highlights tensions present between local practitioners responsible for implementation of the transferred program and foundation personnel responsible for maintenance and the future of the foundation; and illustrates difficulties in maintaining enthusiasm and impetus for a developed program when the goals of the developing foundation have changed over time. Specifically, the study focused on four main findings: (1) donors choose specific programs and practices that support the mission of the organization; (2) specific forms of transfer are involved in the borrowing process that serve as a filter to the information and practices transferred; (3) there is a need for more genuine local involvement in the early stages of program replication; (4) the transfer of a program is not a linear process; instead it becomes enmeshed in the complex social interactions of individuals and organizations involved in the transfer process.",2010,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,Policy transfer in the post-socialist region,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Policy transfer in the post-socialist region: The Open Society Institute and the Step By Step initiative ISBN: 9781124253954,,,,,Early childhood education; Education (Early childhood),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this thesis, I investigate the impact of electric vehicles based on this interaction in order to determine the possible benefits of controlling electric vehicle charging and how they compare to other vehicle options based on optimization models of electricity systems. I estimate the cost reductions from controlled charging of electric vehicles in the New York power system both with and without a high wind penetration and with and without the need for capacity expansion. In this power system, controlled charging can reduce the generation costs associated with charging the vehicles in half, with slightly higher cost reductions in high wind scenarios. I also estimate the cost reductions along with the changes in carbon and criteria air pollutant emissions due to controlled charging in the PJM power system. I examine both current and future grid scenarios, several plug-in vehicles types, and a high wind penetration scenario. Again I find that controlled charging can significantly reduce the costs of charging the vehicles, on the order of 30% of the generation costs to meet the charging demand. However, the environmental and health damages from the emissions cause total social costs to be higher with controlled charging in most cases. Finally, using the charging emissions from PJM, I evaluate the lifecycle emissions of plug-in, hybrid, and conventional vehicles in this region to determine which has lower environmental and health damages. I find that given the representative vehicles studied, plug-in electric vehicles have higher lifecycle damages than hybrids in PJM in 2010 but have lower lifecycle damages in a forecasted 2018 PJM power system.",2/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Electric Vehicles and the Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716195.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to a variety of factors, including technological progress and policy goals, many electric power industry stakeholders believe the business model of electric utilities is on the precipice of unprecedented change. However, calls for dramatic changes to utility business models must be backed by substantive analysis of what aspects of the business model must change, who is best suited to provide what services, and what resources should be deployed to provide these services. This thesis presents a review of current utility business models, an introduction to the agents driving changes in utility business models, and a methodology for assessing emerging business models that bridges two important but heretofore unlinked fields of business model analysis. This thesis first provides a definition of the electricity services upon which business models in the utility industry are based. These definitions are grounded in linear programming and fundamental power system economics and technology. Next, this thesis provides an ontological taxonomy of electricity services business models, and demonstrates the application of this taxonomy on demand response and solar photovoltaics business models. This ontological breakdown is extended from management and strategy literature developed over the past fifteen years in the context of emerging Internet-based businesses. This thesis then demonstrates how quantitative models can be used in combination with qualitative analyses to provide a more complete understanding of which, if any, emerging electricity services business models may prove technically and economically attractive.

LY8IJFP2,thesis,2011,"Smithwick-Rodriguez, Tracie",A Study of College Readiness Programs among High School Students in South Texas,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/914225380?pq-origsite=primo,"Low-income high school graduates are less likely to get to a postsecondary institution than their middle and upper-income peers (U.S. Department of Education, 2000). Students who do enter a four-year institution do not have the necessary academic preparation to succeed and obtain a professional degree. The study examined how two national college awareness process programs differ in college preparation of Texas high school students among student characteristics (gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status). The college readiness initiatives, ""Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs"" (GEAR UP) and the ""Early College High School"" initiative (ECHS) were designed to provide educational services to low-income student populations through communities to help create new and/or expanded plans that strengthen schools in preparing high school students for college-level work and pursuit. The study relied on the ""Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills"" (TAKS) to analyze academic performance, commended performance, and college readiness performance data to measure outcomes of student performance from each of the two programs. Each participating school was required to implement the programs with emphasis on three overarching areas of emphasis: (a) nurturing environment that supports college awareness, which was supported by the Developmental Assets Theory, (Search Institute, 2007); (b) provide college awareness information and educational opportunities consistently, which was supported by Resiliency Theory (Goldstein, 2006); and (c) engaged learning that enhances instruction through professional development for teachers, which was supported through the Experiential Learning Theory (Kolb. 1999). Data were based on TAKS students' testing scores from two South Texas high schools. One high school utilized the GEAR UP program and one high school used the ECHS program. TAKS test scores and student characteristics were provided by the independent school district in which the high schools operate. Students were from the 2010 graduating cohort. Test scores from English Language Arts and Mathematics were compared indicators for college readiness. Data were analyzed with descriptive, two-way ANOVA, t-test, and chi-square statistics. Results indicated that students who were involved in the ECHS college readiness program outperformed students in the GEAR UP program. There was statistical significance between scores as students in the ECHS program had higher scores than those in the GEAR UP program in academic performance and commended performance. Although there was not a statistical difference in college readiness, ECHS had higher scores. Ethnicity and socioeconomic status did not have a significant effect on college readiness achievement. Gender was the only student characteristic that had a statistically difference in college readiness performance. Overall, the ECHS program provided an environment more conducive to student performance for college preparation than GEAR UP. Results indicated that environmental implementations and structures contributed to student performance. The focus or the ECHS program had strong literacy components with structured support services and implementations that enhanced instructional components. The ECHS program appeared to exhibit the strongest instructional environment supportive of Developmental Assets Theory, (Search Institute, 2007), Resiliency Theory (Goldstein, 2006), and Experiential Learning Theory (Kolb, 1999). Future research should expand the study in several areas. The study can be conducted in other areas of the state to see if there are comparable results. Another study could investigate whether statistically significant differences exist among GEAR UP, ECHS, and non-college readiness initiatives to understand what impact a college preparation program may have with non-college readiness programs. An investigation could examine the correlation between testing results to help identify whether one type of test topic impacted another. For example, if higher scores in English Language Arts led to higher scores in other subject areas, then school districts could re-focus both curricular and pedagogical strategies. The study examined how well two national college readiness initiatives prepare Texas high school students for college among student characteristics with necessary implementations from both programs. The study provided insight on how students with varied characteristics and backgrounds experience academic preparations and college readiness. The study was a comprehensive review of instructional experiences and outcomes that lead to academic and college readiness performances. The literature informed and guided the study with themes drawn by the research to reflect previous studies that related to the academic experiences of students and college readiness. All students deserve an opportunity to seek a postsecondary education yet must be academically prepared to be successful in seeking a college degree. An increase in college attainment is a necessity for the State of Texas and will contribute to a stronger economic society.

A small percentage of firms (5%) is responsible for a disproportionately large amount of net job creation (>50%). Named high growth firms, these successful enterprises have been in the spotlight of research looking into the key drivers of firm growth and growth policy. This dissertation explores high growth from multiple perspectives: at the level of the firm, by understanding how the definition of a high growth firm impacts its characteristics and expected performance over time; at the local level, by isolating the effect of political connections of firm performance and firm entry; and at the macro level, by observing the evolution of entrepreneurship during transition. The first study finds that most HGFs are unable to maintain high growth rates for long, but do register lower volatility in growth rates and a higher chance of survival. Results on growth volatility and persistence vary significantly with the specific definition of “high growth” used as well as with the specific variable used to measure growth (e.g., revenue, employees, profit, productivity). These findings have direct implications for growth policies and programs that depend on identifying HGFs. The second study indicates a strong significant effect of political alignment on revenue growth and firm entry. Larger firms take advantage of political connections for performance gains, while small firms are negatively impacted. Furthermore, alignment reduces entry into entrepreneurship by 8-11%. These findings establish political alignment and local-level business-politics collusion as important dynamics to consider when evaluating entrepreneurship policy in developing countries. The third study describes the interdependence between entrepreneurship, institutions, and transitions. The case of Romania shows that the beginning of transition was characterized by an initial explosion of newly created private enterprises, followed by a declining trend in enterprise creation and, recently, by a new increase in entrepreneurship activity. To conclude, this work contributes new perspectives towards a better understanding of high growth firms and growth policy. Policy implications are targeted towards transition and developing economies that have seen little representation in literature. The goal is to enable successful high growth policies across multiple levels.",12/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,High Growth Entrepreneurship,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6719819.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such an escalation threatens the economic output of the Kingdom: more oil and gas are needed to produce electricity and thus less oil and gas available for international trade. Therefore, the Kingdom faces the challenge of looking to atomic and renewable energy as options to fill the electricity gap for the upcoming decades. In this thesis, One of the main challenges is that the energy sector is controlled by multiple stakeholders. We address such a challenge through Stakeholder Value Network Analysis. We provide a thorough characterization of the stakeholder network in terms of direct and indirect value exchange from the point of view of a focal organization: government. We quantify the value exchange in the network and provide a research grounded ranking of the most important stakeholders and the most important transactions of value throughout the network and directly linked to the Saudi government. Finally, we use such characterization and quantification of the stakeholder network to identify the mechanisms and tradeoffs that the government has to include regarding atomic and renewable energies in the production of electricity.",2012,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2012 S.M.,Book Title: Stakeholder value network analysis for the energy system of Saudi Arabia,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although user-centered design approaches remains useful for exploring how people cope with interactive systems, they cannot explain how this new breed of artifacts participates in people's sociality. User-centered design approach assumes that humans control interactive systems, disregarding the agency of smart artifacts. Based on Actor-Network Theory, this research recognizes that artifacts and humans share the capacity of influencing society and meshing with each other, constituting hybrid social actors. From that standpoint, the research offers a triadic structure of networked social interaction as a methodological basis to investigate how smart devices perceive their social setting and adaptively mediate people's interactions within activities. These triadic units of analysis account for the interactions within and between human-nonhuman collectives in the actor-network. The ""within interactions"" are those that hold together humans and smart artifacts inside a collective and put forward the collective's assembled meaning for other actors in the network. The ""between interactions"" are those that occur among collectives and characterize the dominant relational model of the actor-network. This triadic approach was modeled and used to analyze the interactions of participants in three empirical studies of social activities with communal goals, each mediated by a smart artifact that enacted--signified--a balanced distribution of obligations and privileges among subjects. Overall, the studies found that actor-networks exhibit a social viscosity that hinders people's interactions. This is because when people try to collectively accomplish goals, they offer resistance to one another. The studies also show that the intervention of smart artifacts can facilitate the achievement of cooperative and collaborative interaction between actors when the artifacts enact the dominant moral principles which prompt the ""preservation of social balance,"" enhance the network's ""information integrity,"" and are located at the ""focus of activity."" The articulation of Actor-Network Theory principles with interaction design methods opens up the traditional user-artifact dyad towards triadic collective enactments by embracing diverse kinds of participants and practices, thus facilitating the design of enhanced sociality.

M44SZBGD,thesis,2014,"McNamara, Julie H.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program","Bridging gaps in synthetic biology oversight: iGEM as a testbed for proactive, adaptive risk management",,,,,,"On the surface, the emerging field of synthetic biology looks highly similar to that of genetic engineering. However, the two fields are based upon divergent underlying logic structures. Whereas genetic engineering affects change through localized modifications of existing organisms, synthetic biology attempts to fuse independent component parts to create wholly novel applications. While legacy regulatory systems were adequate for monitoring biosafety in the early days of the emerging field, as synthetic biology advances, the fundamental differences in its logic structure are creating fissures in the oversight system. A continued reliance on increasingly incompatible mechanisms squanders the limited present opportunity for proactive risk management, and generates increasing potential for significant future risk exposure in the field. This thesis will describe the current state of domestic and international oversight systems relevant to synthetic biology, and characterize their limits and vulnerabilities. It will argue that the current approach of relying on prescriptive, sequence-based controls creates growing gaps in oversight for a field moving toward amalgam organisms, and that the soft methods intended to bridge these gaps, predominantly in the form of institutional biosafety committees, are instead points of additional significant vulnerability. This thesis will also illustrate the challenges that have arisen because of these gaps, both in theory and in practice, through an examination of the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM). iGEM, a university-level synthetic biology contest, first served as a valuable case study for illuminating challenges associated with the current system. Later, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Program on Emerging Technologies collaborated with iGEM to establish the competition as a policy testbed for demonstrating innovative approaches to biosafety oversight. This thesis will conclude by proposing recommendations for improving biosafety oversight based on lessons learned from the iGEM testbed. First, it is not enough for scientists to recognize that risks exist in their field; as the first line of defense in risk management, they must also be able to identify, understand, and engage with the risks inherent in their own work. Second, in light of the limits imposed on policy revisions due to political gridlock, it is necessary to understand what can be realistically accomplished within the existing federal system, and what instead needs to be achieved outside it. Here, a fuller, more invigorated approach to engagement support is coupled with a mix of improved, adaptive interpretations of the existing oversight system.",2014,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,Bridging gaps in synthetic biology oversight,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,"Book Title: Bridging gaps in synthetic biology oversight : iGEM as a testbed for proactive, adaptive risk management",,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these countries, India is one of the largest portals and destination grounds for the trafficking and sexual enslavement of women and children. This phenomenological study of sex trafficking survivors in Kolkata, India, sought to gain an in-depth understanding of seven women's lived experiences before and during trafficking, as well as postrescue. The study provides a thorough evaluation of the circumstances and conditions that led to the trafficking of these women, their perceptions of themselves and life for the duration of their trafficking experiences, and their impressions of themselves, their treatment, and their futures, postrescue. The study involved seven women, between the ages of 16 and 22, who had been rescued from sex trafficking and involved in the participating nonprofit's rehabilitation program, for at least six months. For the sake of safety, this researcher worked with the facility to screen participants to ensure that each girl fulfilled these study parameters prior to their taking part in interviews. The study consisted of one phenomenologically based interview covering three distinct phases of their life experiences: pretrafficking, during enslavement, and postrescue. To facilitate the exploration of survivors' unique trafficking experiences, the interviews were semistructured and open-ended. Once data was collected, it was reviewed, collapsed into meaning units, and translated into psychologically relevant terminology. During the final phase of data analysis, identified meaning units were integrated, categorized, and summarized. The relevance of these meaning units as potentially informs the more comprehensive understanding and treatment of sex trafficking survivors will be considered and discussed. Limitations of my research include the current prevalence of literature addressing the lived experiences and psychological treatment of sex trafficking survivors in India, my limited capacity to communicate in North Indian dialects, and my status as a woman from another culture with a higher social and caste status than the women who participated in my study. I believe that my study will prove beneficial to better understanding the relationship between the lived experiences of sex trafficking survivors and their psychological treatment postrescue. Even though there was some resistance to me owing to my disparate cultural background and socioeconomic status, it is my belief that even the tension deriving from this resistance will prove helpful in informing aspects of these women's fear and resistance towards society and culture at large, as they begin their journeys towards healing, repatriation, and reintegration into their local communities.",2013,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,Speaking self out of darkness,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Speaking self out of darkness: The lived experience of sex trafficking survivors in Kolkata, India ISBN: 9781303884535 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 8 Volume: 75",,,,,Child abuse; Children; Clinical psychology; Females; India; Kidnapping; Slavery; Social psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M6CHWGU8,thesis,2016,"Dykes, Katherine L.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",Dynamics of technology innovation and diffusion with emphasis on wind energy,,,,,,"This thesis takes an interdisciplinary look at wind energy innovation and diffusion through a historical case study and system dynamic quantitative model. The former uses a framework known as actor-network- theory (that allows technical as well social forces to shape historical outcomes) and applies it to an in-depth case study of the history of the technology throughout several époques. Rather than simplifying the story of the technology into a case of winners and losers, as past studies have done, this work demonstrates the complexity of the history of wind technology where many individuals in different countries, companies and national governments, all play a key role in both direct and indirect development of the technology. Without the confluence of activity from these different groups across time and space, the story of wind energy would be very different. In particular, the history shows how the technology develops and diffuses in different regions at different times in different eras, but that traces of each époque survive into the next so that the overall history of wind energy technology has some continuous threads and an accumulation of global learning. This perspective serves as a basis for the development of a system dynamics model of wind energy development and deployment. The model examines the interplay of technology innovation and diffusion dynamics where markets for the technology are local but innovation and learning is global. Wind energy for electricity generation has overcome significant volatility in local markets over the last several decades thanks to the global aggregation of demand from different countries at different times. At the same time, the persistent presence of a market somewhere in the world at any given time has allowed continuous innovation and technology learning to take place. Looking forward, these local and global feedbacks for innovation and diffusion have important implications for the further development of technology and its ability to become a prominent global source of electricity generation.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 Ph.D.,Book Title: Dynamics of technology innovation and diffusion with emphasis on wind energy,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M8M4KLVQ,thesis,2015,"Stein, Beth R.",Applications of Imaging Spectroscopy in Forest Ecosystems at Multiple Scales,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1991483318?pq-origsite=primo,"Forests provide a number of ecosystem services which sustain and enrich the wildlife, human societies, and the environment. However, many disturbances threaten forest ecosystems, making it necessary to monitor their health for optimal management and conservation. Although there are many indicators of forest health, changes in biogeochemical cycling, loss of species diversity, and invasive plants are particularly useful due to their vulnerability to the effects of climate change and intensive agricultural land use. Thus, this work evaluates the use of imaging spectroscopy to monitor forest nutrient status, species diversity, and plant invasions in the Mid- Atlantic region. The research is divided into four separate studies, each of which evaluated a unique application for imaging spectroscopy data at a different scale within the forest. The first two studies examined loblolly pine nutrient status at the leaf and canopy scales, respectively. The first study determined that loblolly pine foliar macronutrient concentrations can be successfully modeled across the Southeastern US (R2=0.39-0.74). Following on these results, the second study focused on the relationship between physical characteristics, reflectance, and nutrients. Reflectance values and W scattering coefficients produced successful nitrogen models across loblolly pine plots at the canopy scale. Regression models showed similar explanatory power for nitrogen, although W scattering coefficients were significantly correlated with nitrogen at multiple wavelengths and reflectance variables were not. However, the direction of some of the correlations with W and the unusually high directional area scattering factor values indicate a need for further experimentation. The third study found that several imaging spectroscopy algorithms were moderately successful in identifying wavyleaf basketgrass invasions in mixed deciduous forests (overall accuracy=0.35-0.78; kappa=0.41-0.53). Lastly, the fourth study used a novel imaging spectroscopy/lidar fusion to identify canopy gaps and measure species diversity of understory vegetation. The lidar algorithm identified 29 of 34 canopy gaps, and regression models explained 49 percent of the variance in gap species diversity. In conclusion, imaging spectroscopy can be used to evaluate ecosystem health through forest nutrient status, nitrogen models, species diversity estimates, and identification of invasive plant species.",2015,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Applications of Imaging Spectroscopy in Forest Ecosystems at Multiple Scales ISBN: 9780355348187,,,,,Remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MAVNVQPZ,thesis,2015,"Wolff, Joshua Michael; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Acceptance by proxy: analyzing perceptions of hydraulic fracturing to better understand public acceptance for geologic storage of carbon dioxide,,,,,,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) represents an important pathway for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to mitigate climate change. However, there is significant uncertainty about how the technology will be accepted by the public, which is difficult to predict for relatively unknown technologies such as CCS. As such, this thesis explores the use of a similar but better known technology-hydraulic fracturing-as an analogue for learning lessons about public acceptance of the geologic storage component of CCS. The thesis asks two questions: (1) What factors are associated with public acceptance of geologic storage? And (2) What actions should communities, regulators, and stakeholders take to ensure the safe and efficient deployment of CCS technology? The thesis investigates these questions using three separate but related analyses. A series of regressions explores links between states' history of fossil fuel extraction and current regulatory attitudes toward hydraulic fracturing. A comparative case study characterizes trends in the development of laws and regulations related to hydraulic fracturing in three states: Pennsylvania, New York State, and Colorado. Finally, a survey identifies factors associated with positive and negative public perceptions of both hydraulic fracturing and CCS. The survey includes an experimental question that measures the extent to which compensation can be used to improve public acceptance for facility siting. Through these analyses, the thesis reaches several conclusions. States with an extensive history of fossil fuel extraction are more likely to regulate hydraulic fracturing with a moderate level of regulatory stringency, and similar tendencies toward CCS are likely. Municipalities are playing an increasingly significant role in the regulation of hydraulic fracturing, and are likely to be important stakeholders for CCS projects as well. A number of demographic and worldview factors are associated with public acceptance, but none were found to have substantial predictive power. However, the amount of compensation offered to nearby residents was found to have a moderate effect on public acceptance. Developers should therefore consider compensation a tool for increasing the likelihood of acceptance among residents nearby a potential project site. Policymakers should in turn institute market incentives such as robust carbon prices to foster a financial environment that encourages developers to engage with municipalities and residents.",2015,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,Acceptance by proxy,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Acceptance by proxy : analyzing perceptions of hydraulic fracturing to better understand public acceptance for geologic storage of carbon dioxide,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the 1960’s Western education came to Bhutan which already had a Buddhist monastic education system and an informal system using traditional methodologies. Currently all aspects of society, including education, are being aligned to Bhutan’s development policy based on Gross National Happiness (GNH). Data for this qualitative research study was collected through interviews in Bhutan and ongoing communication with Bhutanese educators and school reformers. Eight people educated only or first through traditional methodologies were interviewed as well as six who had a combination of Western and traditional education. Three common themes emerged across groups: (1) formal learning was seen as related to spiritual/moral development, (2) experiences of learning were associated with a sense of meaning and personal/internal motivation, and (3) alphabetic literacy was seen to be strongly related to formal learning. Also common to all groups was participation in some type of non-Western learning methodology. Further study of such experiences seems very relevant to creating an education system in Bhutan based on GNH. The navigation processes of two education organizations in Bhutan were also compared and contrasted. Both face similar issues but have very different functions and goals. The Institute of Language and Cultural Studies (ILCS) began as a monastic school for lay people and is now part of the Royal University of Bhutan. In its process of change, it has retained its traditional languages and monastic curriculum while adding a more student-centered pedagogy, study of the English language, and technology. The Royal Education Council (REC) is a temporary organization commissioned by the King to align the education system with GNH. The work of the REC is to reform the current imported Western style system to form a new system based on student-centered models which incorporates traditional values and prepares students to function in the broader world. Study of this navigation can inform Western educators about the conscious process of school reform.",2009,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Navigating Learning in Bhutan, Land of the Thunder Dragon ISBN: 9781109329964 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 9 Pages: 3300 Volume: 70",,,,,"Education, Bilingual; School management and organization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MCLTZI6K,thesis,2010,"Zhang, Na; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Apply option-thinking in long term infrastructure investment: the case of commercial real estate,,,,,,"Over the last two decades the application of real options theory has dramatically altered the way researches model infrastructure investment decisions. Real options are the right, but not obligation to do something for a certain cost within or at a specific period of time. Compared to the rich literature, its implementation in practice is however limited. This thesis identifies a common but ignored problem of the option valuation methodology. While trends and volatilities of market-based uncertainties are fundamental inputs for options valuation, they are in many cases difficult to get reliable estimates due to the changing patterns of the uncertainty factors. Current research on option valuation typically extracts estimates from data of a certain period (such as 10 years) without verifying the chosen period is superior to others. This thesis demonstrates this problem by analyzing the prices indices of underlying assets in real estate markets of U.S. and Singapore; and then shows how to adjust the flexibility design and valuation in long-term infrastructure development to capture the value of embedded options. Since uncertainty is the key driver of option value, the study of uncertainty itself should always be at the core of flexibility design. An in-depth study of (a) both the feature/nature of each uncertainty (b) and interactions among different uncertainties, inside and outside of the project/investment is essential and extremely important to give rise to attractive real options. This thesis looks at a sub-part of long-term infrastructure development - commercial real estate - which is usually high-rise building existing in a highly volatile market. An option-thinking approach is proposed to guide flexibility design, both inactive and proactive flexibility. Proactive flexibility gives rise to an infrastructure design that makes sense for both now and the future. This happens when the design use uncertainties, not the requirements from the user meeting, as one of the primary drivers of the design. The approach involves three aspects: financial, technical and political. Particularly, the political aspect indicates that developers should carefully form contracts with partners/customers as well as relevant authorities to make it possible to exercise the options in the future when desirable. This thesis uses a true case of mixed use commercial real estate development - Central in Singapore - to show the process of utilizing option-thinking in flexibility design and valuation.",2010,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,Apply option-thinking in long term infrastructure investment,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: Apply option-thinking in long term infrastructure investment : the case of commercial real estate,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MDTZS7I9,thesis,2015,"Sakhrani, Vivek A.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",Negotiated collaboration: a study in flexible infrastructure design,,,,,,"This thesis frames design in infrastructure public-private partnerships (P3s) as an exercise in negotiated collaboration. I investigate whether the collaborative design process in P3s can systematically deliver the benefits of innovation in design. The focus is on two aspects of the design process: project co-design, and collaboration mechanism. I find that both aspects enable innovation by driving project actors to learn about the design space and develop a shared understanding of the design problem. Learning through shared understanding not only improves quantifiable payoffs (Objective Value) but also enhances the actors' psycho-social outcomes (Subjective Value). Co-design is a process in which project actors simultaneously design technical and contractual features of a project. I developed a tradespace model to visualize and explore value trade-offs from co-design, using a desalination P3 as a project case. Co-design is a fundamental improvement over the traditional sequential design process because it reveals the zone of negotiated agreement, a frontier set of designs available to project actors, that can help them meet their own objectives while balancing value trade-offs. The combination of flexible modular designs and risk sharing revenue guarantee mechanisms emerged as a frontier design choice in the co-design analysis. Communication and common knowledge are two different collaboration mechanisms that affect the design choices of project actors. A controlled design experiment with 112 experienced designers tested the relative effects of these two mechanisms. The role-playing designers negotiated design decisions for a desalination P3 using the co-design tradespace model. Only the communication mechanism systematically shifted outcomes. To increase the reliability of meeting uncertain water demand, the firm traded away an expected net present value profit share of 24% (p<0.001) on average, subject to the parameter assumptions. The water authority increased contractual payments by an expected net present value share of 6.6% (p<0.001) on average. Final designs in the exercise were on average 97.5% reliable in meeting uncertain water demand. Communication dominated common knowledge as a collaboration mechanism because it enabled participants to learn about the effects of modularity and revenue guarantees on counter-party outcomes and use these design features to negotiate value trade-offs. Objective Value represents the technical (reliability) and economic (profits, payments) payoffs to project participants. Subjective Value on the other hand captures social psychological outcomes such as the degree of trust and rapport between collaborators and perceived fairness and legitimacy of the process, which are important for the partnering relationship. Participants in the collaboration experiment overwhelmingly reported high Subjective Value scores, which are positively correlated with both their improved understanding of the project's design objectives (r = 0.37, p = 0.41, p<0.001) and their ability to communicate with collaborators to agree on design choices (r = 0.36, p = 0.36, p = 0.001). This work directly addresses the literature on infrastructure public-private partnerships and shows how negotiated collaboration can create objective as well as psychosocial benefits for a stronger partnering relationship. The co-design approach speaks to the literature on systems design to emphasize how a systems view can help designers balance trade-offs. The experimental study is a methodological contribution to both the design and negotiations literature, applying the Subjective Value framework in an integrated design setting.",2015,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,Negotiated collaboration,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: Negotiated collaboration : a study in flexible infrastructure design,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MIX7UTVG,thesis,2024,"Heine, Cate E.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Leveraging geospatial data to understand social mixing in cities,,,,,,"Understanding the impact of dense social interactions in urban areas is crucial for designing inclusive cities, as they contribute to both the benefits and challenges of urban living. Various urban planning paradigms and design approaches, such as the 15 minute city, aim to foster social connections and accessibility across communities. However, evaluating the effectiveness of these paradigms is difficult given the complexity of measuring social interactions. In the following projects, I leverage large, geospatial datasets which capture human mobility to describe policy and design impacts on social mixing in three different urban contexts. Study 1 presents a new way to measure social segregation in mobility patterns using sparse, anonymized geolocation data. We identify homophily in the way that Stockholm residents travel through cities without performing privacy-invasive and data-intensive home location detection. Study 2 calculates this metric with geolocated Twitter data to analyze the impacts of Paris's ""Zones 30"" policy, which aimed to enhance human mobility and social mixing by reducing speed limits and implementing street improvements. We find that areas of the city where the policy was implemented fostered more activity from more unique Twitter users who come from more neighborhoods of the city, but not from more socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods of the city. Study 3 employs call detail record data to measure social mixing on a fine spatial and temporal scale across the city of Stockholm, identifying the types of urban amenities that are located in areas where highly income-diverse groups of people gather. We then leverage quasi-random shocks to the road network due to maintenance-based road closures in order to identify causally-interpretable relationships between increasing access to various types of urban amenities and experienced segregation. Study 4 draws on GPS data from mobile phones in order to assess the relationship between local living, as advocated for by the ""15-minute city"" urban planning paradigm, and experienced socioeconomic segregation across the US. We find that low-income neighborhoods with high levels of local living see lower levels of experienced diversity, indicating a potential tradeoff between the social and environmental goals of the 15-minute city paradigm.Collectively, these studies highlight the value of fine-grained mobility data in understanding the types of urban spaces and layouts that foster social interactions between diverse groups of people and those that exacerbate social segregation-questions critical to the design of inclusive, sustainable cities.",2024,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Leveraging geospatial data to understand social mixing in cities,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With declining growth rate projections and access to electricity services all near or at 100%, developed countries have increased their share of sustainable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Unlike the most developed nations, populations are expected to increase drastically throughout the developing world in the 21st century. Recent estimates indicate 97% of the world’s population growth through 2030 (1.3 billion more people) will occur in the developing world. The countries of sub-Saharan Africa alone are projected to add over a billion people through 2050. Such population growth in developing countries will result in growing energy demand and thus growing emissions. The United Nations has underscored the importance of ushering in responsible and equitable energy pathways through their Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With a set of goals emphasizing access to affordable and reliable power, access to modern energy services, and reducing poor air quality and GHG emissions, the SDGs aim to improve quality of life across key areas of concern. The aim of this dissertation is to identify and evaluate opportunities for avoiding continued increases in fossil fuel use in sub-Saharan Africa, which would in turn reduce and avoid emissions of greenhouse gases and criteria air pollution and reduce some associated costs.In Chapter 2 we analyze the energy, emissions, and consumer costs of power outages in sub-Saharan African countries. By modeling the fuel mix for the central electricity grid in each country and the diesel fuel needed to produce backup electricity during outages, we estimate the magnitude of these impacts in the region. We show that use of backup generators leads to higher fossil energy consumption (compared to the central grid) in all countries, even countries that already rely on fossil fuels for power generation at centralized plants. Furthermore, for all countries in the analysis, backup diesel generators result in increased mean emissions of at least three of the five pollutants analyzed, compared to the grid. Our analysis highlights the magnitude of potential avoided emissions and economic savings from increased grid reliability, and has implications for achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Increased reliability may not lead to decreases in generator ownership, but it is likely to lead to decreases in generator use, thus avoiding additional emissions and reducing costs for consumers.In Chapter 3 we assess the emissions, health, and economic outcomes of electrifying motorcycle taxis in Kigali, Rwanda. By modeling fleet demand using observed driving distributions, we are able to estimate travel of this unique subset of all motorcycles which form the basis for all estimates. Our analysis reveals that emissions of key pollutants already identified by government officials (NOx, CO, HCs) as well as the greenhouse gas CO2 and health risks from PM2.5 can be drastically reduced via motorcycle fleet electrification. While a reduction of primary and secondary PM2.5 exposure and thus deaths can be achieved with the electrification of motorcycles, such benefits are dependent on the marginal generating unit. Finally, the Levelized Costs of Driving analysis reveals that at least one of the electric motorcycle alternatives presented in this work is cost competitive over a five-year period, and cost competitiveness improves as vehicle life is extended.In Chapter 4 we extend the vehicle electrification analysis to assess the benefits and costs of bus electrification in Rwanda. We employ a Monte Carlo Analysis to assess how the emissions, health impacts, and non-infrastructure costs associated with diesel powered buses compare to those associated with their electric counterparts. We find that mean emissions of CO2, PM2.5, NOx, CO, and HC all decline significantly when travel provided by diesel buses is replaced with electric buses. However, we also observe increased emissions of SO2 with bus electrification due in part to the prevalence of heavy fuel oil and peat electricity generation. Despite this increased SO2, the health analysis reveals that electrification can result in less annual deaths from primary and secondary PM2.5 but not if peat is the marginal electricity generating unit. Our economic analysis shows that electric buses have greater present levelized costs but given a decrease in capital cost and longer lifetime, electric buses can reach parity with the diesel buses. The final analysis in this chapter compares the normalized emissions and costs of conventional motorcycles, electric motorcycles, conventional buses, and electric buses. We find that the electric buses offer the greatest emission reductions (per passenger-kilometer) while the diesel buses offer the cheapest levelized costs. This research highlights the important role public transit electrification could play in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals as countries commit to lower greenhouse gas and harmful air pollutant emissionsFinally, in Chapter 5 we discuss the important role developing countries will play in achieving global sustainability as their population, mobility, and electricity usage rise over the coming decades. We discuss the implications that reliable power and electrification efforts could have for the Sustainable Development Goals and urge developed nations to assist developing countries in implementing some of the technologies necessary for their completion.

Previous research suggests that these events are not isolated, but rather foreshadow a risk that is to continue and likely increase with a changing climate (17). Since extensive energy infrastructure exists along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts, these facilities are exposed to an increasing risk of flooding. We study the combined impacts of anticipated sea level rise, hurricane activity, and subsidence on energy infrastructure in these regions with a first application to Galveston Bay. Using future climate conditions as projected by four different Global Circulation Models (GCMs), we model the change in hurricane activity from present day climate conditions in response to a climate projected in 2100 under the IPCC A l B emissions scenario using hurricane analysis developed by Emanuel (5). We apply the results from hurricane runs from each model to the SLOSH model (Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) (19) to investigate the change in frequency and distribution of surge heights across climates. Further, we incorporate uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of sea level rise and subsidence, resulting in more detailed projections of risk levels for energy infrastructure over the next century. With a detailed understanding of energy facilities' changing risk exposure, we conclude with a dynamic programming cost-benefit analysis to optimize decision making over time as it pertains to adaptation.",2012,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2012 S.M.,Book Title: The vulnerability of U.S. coastal energy infrastructure under climate change,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This population has been predominantly overlooked by the academy apart from the Family Lifestyles Study completed at UCLA twenty years ago. In this, the first study of its kind, I explore the ethnological specificity of this set of people, Post-Cool Kids. I have integrated the methodologies of Michel Foucault and the theories of archetypal psychology developed by James Hillman with work done by Victor Turner as well as other work from the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, literary criticism, feminist theory, cultural studies and histories of the sixties era. I use this interdisciplinary data to inform a qualitative study of eighteen subjects raised by countercultural parents. I asked my subjects about their lives as children, teenagers, young adults, and currently approaching midlife. Through an analysis of these interviews I identified six cultural complexes specific to the counterculture that I then deconstructed and discussed as systems of knowing within the American culture of the last forty years: freedom, anti-authority, intense experience, cool, being real, and utopia. These complexes together provide a unique way of experiencing the world that informs the ethnological and psychological perspective of Post-Cool Kids, and provides them with a multi-schematic, process-based way of engaging with the world around them. I also discuss such topics as alternative education, communal experiences, drug addiction, creative thinking, embodied trauma, parental entwinement, and personal activism. My objective was to identify the transmission of culture from counterculture parents to their Post-Cool Kids. In the process I developed several unique methodological approaches. Merging postmodern theory, archetypal psychology and methods from religious studies and anthropology, I evaluate the nature of belief within a secular cultural context. Ultimately, I place American historical concepts of utopia side by side with the experience and multi-schematic perspective of Post-Cool Kids to suggest that they represent an emergent pattern in culture, and show how they can inform new theories of utopia.",2013,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,Post-cool kids,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Post-cool kids: How the children born into the counterculture of the American 1960s and 70s became a scattered, disorganized, postmodern tribe ISBN: 9781303075322 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 9 Volume: 74",,,,,Children; Counterculture; Ethnology; Parents; Psychology; Social psychology; Utopias,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rare opportunity to redefine emergency preparedness has been created by the ongoing work at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop the capability to address small modular reactors and other new technologies and to transition to a risk-informed performance-based regulatory structure. This dissertation develops a new framework for emergency preparedness that can address the characteristics of new reactor technologies while also addressing the limitations of current methods. A review of the literature, current regulations, and methods identifies gaps and limitations. Statistically valid methods are defined to enable new analysis of uncertainty and use cases in limited regulatory validated computer codes. A new interdisciplinary framework for emergency planning is developed to reduce the barriers present in current methods, then a risk-based model that integrates protective action and hazard dispersion models is defined. This integrated model considers the risk caused by multiple hazards, including radiological and transportation hazards. The interdisciplinary and integrated structure of the model provides the opportunity for new measures of effectiveness that provide additional insights beyond existing metrics.The integrated model is used to evaluate emergency response at the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station as a case study. The key findings of this case study provide insight into effects previously not discussed in nuclear power emergency planning studies. The ability to compare protective actions across multiple metrics allows for risk and consequences-based evaluation and provides more information for decision-makers. When combined dose and non-dose risks are considered, many historically common protective action strategies become inadvisable by creating more combined risk than taking no action. Even small amounts of time between initiating a protective action and the release of radiation can potentially result in a substantial reduction of consequences. The behavior of the population has a large impact on consequences but is not sufficiently captured in prior studies.",2/9/22,5/20/25 15:39,5/20/25 15:39,5/20/25 15:39,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/19115987.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/WMI86W3Z/Stein - 2022 - An Interdisciplinary Decision Framework for Risk-Based Nuclear Power Plant Emergency Planning and Pr.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis establishes the strategies for the public RTOs in a developing country of Africa, taking Botswana as the case scenario. The aim of the strategies is to leverage the operations of public RTOs to enhance technological research and innovation that will address Africa's development problems. Developing countries around the world are seeking ways to enhance economic growth by improving key institutes of knowledge, innovation and technological advancement. The importance of technological research institutes in an economy cannot be overemphasized. The public research and technology organisations form a pivotal category of the key actors that accentuate innovation towards economic development. They are key players in the national innovation system (NIS), and therefore important to be embedded in it. The study identified three (3) research questions as: (i) what are the characteristics of public research and technology organisations (RTOs) in Botswana? (ii) what is the role of RTOs in the national innovation system (NIS)? (iii) what are the appropriate strategies for research and technology organisations (RTOs) in Botswana? The compass card model was applied when conducting the empirical study and to address the research questions. The application of the model enabled capturing data which has not been obtained before; therefore, the study contributes information to the body of literature about the characteristics of public laboratories in a Sub-Saharan African country. Although the scope of this research is on research and technology organisations in a developing country it traverses the wider issues of innovation to support and aid in building-up the framework for RTO strategies that would leverage the functions of the institutes' to contribute towards knowledge creation, technological advancement and economic progress. The framework for research strategies for Botswana public RTOs is the final outcome of the thesis, and it also serves as contribution to literature especially to other African countries that may use it as a benchmark.",2009,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Framework for Strategies for Public Technology Research Institutes in the National Innovation System (The Case of Botswana) ISBN: 9780438499553,,,,,Civil engineering; Political planning; Public policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MP3AQ732,thesis,2018,"Mueller, Joshua M.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Evaluating storage technologies for wind and solar energy,,,,,,"Rapidly falling wind and solar energy costs over the past four decades have led to exponential growth in installation of these technologies. However, these intermittent renewables do not reliably produce power on demand. One possible mitigation strategy is the addition of energy storage technologies, which are able to shift generation to later periods of higher demand or price. In competitive markets, storage adoption to facilitate renewables penetration will depend on how much value storage can bring to a wind or solar power plant. Which of the diverse energy storage technologies are best suited to profitably perform this function? How do price and resource variability determine the preferred technologies? This thesis develops two novel methods of comparing storage technologies in hybrid wind-storage or solar-storage power plants. In the first, we evaluate technologies based on the increased value of a marginal hybrid plant under today's conditions. We further explain these results by finding the determinants of storage value under uncertainty. In the second, we find the least-cost hybrid plants able to meet predefined demand profiles. Through simulation, optimization, and statistical analysis, we address the following questions: 1) How can one compare candidate storage technologies? 2) What price and resource features determine storage value? 3) What are the cost targets for storage under different market conditions? To address question 1, we optimize storage operation and size for grid-scale energy arbitrage, and study the value of hybrid plants using different storage technologies. The value of the hybrid plant is found by comparing benefits to costs, and is estimated across locations and technologies. We show that at today's wind and solar generation costs, some storage technologies can provide value, but further cost improvement is needed, especially for electrochemical technologies, to facilitate widespread adoption. Finally, we determine both cost targets and the optimal direction of cost improvement for diverse storage technologies and locations. In order to answer question 2, we identify features of the electricity market and the renewables resource availability that determine value. Through simulations of an artificial price time series in which features of electricity price spikes are varied, we find that storage value is driven by the frequency and amplitude of price spikes and the availability of the energy resource. The durations of price spikes determine the relative value of one storage technology to another, because of differing technology cost structures. We demonstrate these results in historical data and explain the differences in storage value across locations. We also explore how uncertainty in future prices impacts storage value. We determine a new heuristic for storage operation and sizing absent perfect foresight. This approach is able to capture at least 80% of the expected value under perfect foresight and improves upon existing heuristics. In answering question 3, we determine the least-cost combination of wind and solar with storage that provides reliable, dispatchable, pre-determined outputs. This approach allows for the evaluation of storage technologies for a possible future with higher renewables penetration. Preferred technologies for this use context have very low energy capacity costs (< $50/kWh), enabling inexpensive installation of long duration storage. Long periods of low wind or solar availability determine storage requirements and can be mitigated by including both wind and solar in the generation portfolio. New cost targets are derived for storage development that would help enable higher levels of renewables adoption.",2018,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2018 Ph.D.,Book Title: Evaluating storage technologies for wind and solar energy,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I performed a safety transportation risk analysis, which shows a high fatality and injury risk from road crashes in Bogota. I then analyzed safety-related benefits and costs of crash avoidance technology used in transit buses. My analysis reveals that despite of the life-safety benefit expected, Bogota’s values of statistical life and injuries make an investment on the technology for buses fall into the economically unjustified ranges. To analyze traffic related air pollution emissions, I developed a link-based emission model, which then it’s used to explore the traffic-related air pollution impacts of a highway capacity enhancement plan and a scrappage program for private cars. I use a bottom-up model that couples detailed activity data from a TAM, developed in EMME/4, with various emissions factors to develop a high-resolution road traffic emissions inventory for Bogotá. In particular, I use three emission models to produce the traffic related emission inventory, which includes exhaust emissions of five criteria air pollutants: Carbon monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), Sulphur oxides (SO2), Particulate Matter (PM, particles with diameters of 10 micrometers and smaller), and Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions generated by hot-stabilized vehicle activity. The on-road vehicle emission model developed as part of this work marks an important turn over previous tools, because it opens the possibility to integrate environmental and transportation policy-making in Bogota. Integrating transportation and environmental policies has the potential to move the focus of environmental programs from “end-of-the-pipe” solutions to holistic analysis of how the land use, transportation systems and vehicle technology decisions play out on the levels of pollution in the city.",8/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6719939.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MSHMUMIY,thesis,2010,"Smith-Grieco, Anthony Nicoll; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",The Internet as recommendation engine: implications of online behavioral targeting,,,,,,"This thesis discusses the economic implications of Internet behavioral advertising, which targets ads to individuals based on extensive detailed data about the specific websites users have visited. Previous literature on behavioral advertising has focused almost exclusively on privacy issues; there has been less study of how it might affect industry structure. This thesis examines which parties in the online advertising value chain would benefit the most from the demand for detailed behavioral data; in particular, it examines whether aggregators (such as advertising networks) that track behavior across a large number of websites would derive the greatest benefit. Qualitative stakeholder analysis is used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of several categories of actors: advertisers, advertising agencies, publishers, advertising networks, advertising exchanges, Internet service providers, and users. Advertising agencies might attempt to bypass networks and work directly with publishers, becoming aggregators in their own right. Publishers might need to become interactive ""information experiences"" in order to collect valuable behavioral data. Users might demand more transparency about what is happening with their data, or even more control over the data collection process. Overall, agencies, networks, and advertising exchanges appear to be in the best position; publishers are faced with a harder task. Furthermore, behavioral targeting may not result in a dramatic increase in overall online advertising spending.",2010,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,The Internet as recommendation engine,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: The Internet as recommendation engine : implications of online behavioral targeting,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MTLD9AZD,thesis,2014,"Mirakhorli, Abbas",A comparative study: Utilizing data mining techniques to classify traffic congestion status,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1629025862?pq-origsite=primo,"Performance measure is a process of evaluating and quantifying a system. Performance measure provides us with information about how good a system is working and how well the predefined goals are met. In order to analyze the performance of a transportation system, the traffic data such as speed, volume, occupancy and travel time of the system need to be collected. These data will generate valuable historical database that can be used to develop models to improve the quality of service of transportation system. The performance measures in transportation studies can be categorized to following main groups: Congestion, Mobility, Accessibility, Reliability, Safety and Environmental. Traffic congestion is one the important issues in any transportation system. Growing congestion in urban transportation network has enforced significant economic burdens to our current society. It causes waste of time, money, fuel and energy for the commuters and consequently impacting daily life of people in the society. Based on 2011 Congested Corridors Report presented by Texas A& M Transportation Institute, traffic congestion incurred $121 billion cost for drivers. Based on this report, 5.5 billion additional hours are wasted waiting in traffic in 2011. It means $818 additional fuel and time cost for each commuter. Being aware of the status of congestion in future can help, decision makers, intelligent systems and apps improve their accuracy and help commuters in their travel routing. To achieve these goals accurate traffic status classification techniques is required. Achieving higher accuracy is still one of the influential driving factor for research in this area. The objective of this thesis is to utilize data mining techniques to classify traffic status to congested or non-congested for some point of time in future based on historical traffic parameters (Vehicle Count, Occupancy, Speed). Moreover, to compare the performance of different data mining techniques on this problem. This dissertation examined several classification techniques including J48 Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector machine, PART and K-Nearest Neighborhood to classify future traffic status to Congested or Non-congested. The one minute traffic data from I-15 Northbound from I-215 up to Desert Inn, Las Vegas, NV were used to run these experiments.

This study addresses that gap in the literature, and serves the interests of those who seek an understanding of divination as it is practiced in contemporary Western society. This study explores the world of psychic-mediums, people who practice a type of divination that involves receiving, interpreting, and communicating both psychic impressions and communications from disincarnate entities. To understand psychic-mediums, the study examines their experiences, assumptions, and views of themselves and their profession, as well as their core assumptions and beliefs. A developmental model of consciousness is used as the basis for understanding the findings. Twenty psychic-mediums completed a questionnaire based on a developmental model of consciousness. A subset of 6 of these participants then participated in an in-depth interview, focusing on their life histories and perceptions of their psychic and mediumship experiences. The results were analyzed for both commonalities in themes and differences in the histories and beliefs. Themes that emerged were examined in the context of developmental theories of consciousness. The results showed that despite some important variations, the participants had many common beliefs and attitudes about their work, as well as about topics such as spirituality and the afterlife. An important finding was that the interview participants all viewed their work as psychics and mediums as a healing profession, rather than as entertainment or within some other context. The interview participants all exhibited a high degree of independence in their attitudes towards their work and their personal belief systems. Nonetheless, they also displayed a strong tendency towards flexibility and regarded their views as relative and conditioned by their own experiences and culture. In terms of consciousness development, the interview participants supported the survey results, which suggested a strong tendency towards self-actualization and authentic consciousness.",2011,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,Divination as a life path in contemporary America,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Divination as a life path in contemporary America: An in-depth exploration of the world of psychic-mediums ISBN: 9781124902180 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 12 Pages: 4584 Volume: 72,,,,,Attitudes; Divination; Metaphysics; Parapsychology; Religiousness; Social psychology; Spirituality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary setting for these studies is the mobile financial services industry. Additionally, this dissertation looks at the overall significance of user innovation at the country level in order to discern drivers of user innovation diffusion. Finally, it investigates implications for innovation policy. These topics are addressed in three studies. The first study examines two main research questions. First, to what extent can users play a role in innovation in developing countries? Second, what is the global relevance and diffusion of innovations that originate in developing countries? This study finds that users pioneered over half of mobile financial services and that 85% of the services originated in developing countries. A comparison between all innovations in this industry shows that user innovations diffuse at more than double the rate of firm innovations. Additionally, three-quarters of the innovations that originated in developing countries diffused to OECD countries. This study also proposes a new methodology to analyze the sources of service innovations, which can be used in future research. The second study tries to answer the following research question: Under what conditions can industries emerge in the economic ‘South’? In addition, what firms are successful at entering in the South? This study uses a hand-collected dataset from the mobile financial services industry. We find that latent demand is an important driver for firm entry in developing countries, as is market share. Furthermore, previous entry in the industry leads to industry-specific knowledge accumulation, which spills over within firms and increases the likelihood of subsequent entry into other countries. The third study examines the characteristics of diffusion of user innovations using data from a large-scale national survey conducted in Portugal. It looks at differences between market and non-market channels of diffusion for professional-user innovators as well as end-user innovators. The main findings are that although most user innovators are willing to share their innovations for free, they do not actively inform other people about their solutions, which negatively affects diffusion. Furthermore, this research concludes that professional-user innovators are significantly more likely to protect their intellectual property than end-user innovators, which increases the likelihood of commercialization of the innovation.",5/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Three Studies on Innovation and Diffusion,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723911.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These consequences and perceptions have important policyimplications, ranging from potentially billions of dollars in societal costs that depend on credit card reissue decisions to the perceived fairness of sentences imposed on people convicted of cybercrimes. I analyze these consequences and perceptions using a combination of legal, empirical economic, and criminological analyses. First, this work analyzes at the economics of credit card reissue after a data breach. Using a parameterized estimation model based on publicly-available information, it compares the cost ofreissuing cards to the total expected cost of fraud if cards are not reissued. The model suggests that automatically reissuing cards may have lower social costs than the costs of waiting until fraud is attempted, although the range of results is considerably broad. The results also show how alack of quality public information about data breach and identity theft can make informed public policy decisions more difficult. Second, it explores a potential misalignment between the factors that contribute to cybercrime sentences and the importance of those factors in public perceptions. It presents the results of two empirical studies that measure public perceptions of different factual attributes ofcybercrime. The studies show that Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) sentences are indeed out of alignment with the public’s views and provide empirical support for arguments that CFAA sentencing is miscategorized in the federal sentencing guidelines. Third, it addresses the question of whether CFAA subsection (a)(2), coveringunauthorized access to a computer to obtain information, should be considered a trespass, burglary, or fraud statute. It does this through an analysis of case records and sentencing data from 1,095 real-world CFAA sentences, and an experimental study of perceptions of 499 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The results of both studies suggest that (a)(2) is not like trespass or fraud, at least in terms of current punishments or perceptions, and lend support to arguments that CFAA sentencing should be covered under its own section of the sentencing guidelines.",9/28/21,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:43,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/16679617.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/EKLNISHU/Graves - 2021 - Empirical Analyses of Effects and Perceptions of Cybercrime.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the composition of faculty at public research universities is changing. Understanding the impact that these changes have on how public research universities function at both an organizational level and individual level is of critical importance if public research universities are to adapt and thrive. This dissertation focuses on the study of faculty roles and governance in public research universities. It considers the impact of both fiscal pressures and stress caused by the external environment as well as the influence of internal and external stakeholders on how public research universities are adapting institutionally--from a governance perspective, and individually--from a role perspective. It considers the structures, processes, and role demands that impact academic governance utilizing organizational theory, higher education governance theory, and role theory. It considers the critical importance of the organizational context of the public research university vis-à-vis society focusing on key aspects of the university as an organization and the importance of dimensionality of role. Six hypotheses will be tested using two data sets. Data from the Integrated Post- Secondary Education Data System (IPEDS) of the National Center for Education Statistics for the period between 1987 and 2007 will be utilized to identify trends regarding faculty hiring (tenure system, non-tenure system, and part-time). A second data set from the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) at UCLA's Cooperative Institutional Research Program for the period between 1989 and 2004 will be used to identify trends regarding faculty roles, stress, and satisfaction. Based on the empirical findings, a discussion of the implications for public research universities related to these changes will follow, including evolving structures, processes, and roles in governance. Future research will be proposed that is aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of the relationship between the role of the institution in society and the role of the individual within public research universities.

The goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of how the costs of doing HSI work within a program can be estimated. The research is divided into two parts. In the first part, problem formulation, literature from several relevant domains is first reviewed. Next a descriptive case study is conducted on the development of the Pratt and Whitney F 119 engine. It examines activities done to support HSI up to engineering and manufacturing development and concludes that, among other factors, HSI in requirements are a major driver of effort. This conclusion leads to work on the integration of HSI into the counting of requirements for an existing systems engineering cost model. In the second part of the research, implementation and validation, two workshops are conducted to assess how HSI considerations are addressed in real-world requirements engineering. The first workshop tests existing requirements counting guidelines, identifies weakness, and suggests improvement. The second workshop applies the Wideband Delphi method to generate consensus between stakeholders in order to deliver a quantitative estimate of HSI effort. The workshop also demonstrates that stakeholders perceive functional and nonfunctional requirements as driving effort in similar ways, a conclusion that challenges a widely-held belief that nonfunctional requirements are less significant than functional ones. The research done in the case study and workshops results in improvements to the existing systems engineering cost model, and an application of the model is presented. Policy considerations are discussed. The integration of the HSI into the model represents a significant step toward being better able to plan HSI effort in acquisition programs.",2010,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: Cost estimation of human systems integration,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose a methodology to create a data-driven decision process for post-disaster resource allocation that enables timely, transparent and consistent decision-making during crisis. Our methodology defines the decisions that must be made, identifies relevant historical, initial, and trending data sources, and develops numerical thresholds, quantitative relationships, and optimization models to support decision making. The general process also offers flexibility to consider non-quantitative factors and spans multiple review periods. We apply this methodology to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) program for establishing and managing Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs) after a disaster. A detailed case study of one disaster response and relevant historical data provide the basis for DRC decision making thresholds, relationships, and optimization models. We then apply the newly developed process to several recent disaster response scenarios and find that FEMA could have reduced cost by 60-80% while providing sufficient capacity for survivors. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of the methodology to other post-disaster programs along with limitations and potential future work.",2014,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,Data-driven resource allocation decisions,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Data-driven resource allocation decisions : FEMA's disaster recovery centers,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEKTZBFP,thesis,2021,"Yang, Qi; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems","Partisanship, friendship, and censorship in online social networks",,,,,,"With the widespread adoption of social media in today's society, it has become increasingly important to understand users' behaviors and the underlying factors driving these behaviors. This thesis considers different aspects of this problem, from tie formation to influence campaigns, examining factors of partisanship, friendship, and censorship in today's online social networks. We begin in the first chapter with an overview of social media and the key behaviors of the users of these platforms and the platforms themselves that we will be studying. In the second chapter, we introduce the follow back problem, and examine how different following strategies and political ideologies can influence the follow back rate. After obtaining followers, one can then begin posting content to influence them. In the third chapter, we consider this type of influence campaign. Recent studies have shown that exposure to opposing opinions causes a backfire effect, where people become more steadfast in their original beliefs. We demonstrate a technique known as pacing and leading which can mitigate this backfire effect over time. In the fourth chapter, we consider the challenge of inferring political bias in a hyper-partisan media ecosystem. From empirical studies in the previous chapters, we discovered that Twitter exhibited an anti-conservative bias when suspending users. However, many studies find that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation on social media. Therefore, it is possible that the suspensions are due to enforcing an unbiased policy aimed at limiting the spread of misinformation. Here, we evaluate the two possible hypotheses empirically by examining the suspension of Twitter users. We found that the observation that Republicans were more likely to be suspended than Democrats provides no evidence that Twitter was biased against conservatives. Instead, this asymmetry can be explained entirely by the tendency of the Republicans to share more misinformation. Lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic created large shifts in how people stay connected with each other due to social distancing and isolation measures. In the fifth chapter, we study research questions around the impact of COVID-19 on online public and private sharing propensity, its influence on online communication homophily, and correlations between online communication and offline case severity in the United States. To do so, we study the usage patterns of 79 million US-based users on Snapchat, a large, leading mobile multimedia-driven social sharing platform. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 has increased private communication, while decreased publicly shared content when users are out-and-about, decreased homophily across locations, ages and genders, and has a positive correlation with widening gaps between across-state and within-state communication increases after the onset of COVID-19.",2021,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Partisanship, friendship, and censorship in online social networks",,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEQ8AXLL,journalArticle,2020,"Roth, Michael",Going Nuclear for Climate Mitigation and Energy Systems Modeling of Carbon Dioxide and Air Pollution Taxes,,,,10.1184/R1/12001224.V1,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/Going_Nuclear_for_Climate_Mitigation_and_Energy_Systems_Modeling_of_Carbon_Dioxide_and_Air_Pollution_Taxes/12001224/1,"The consumption of energy in the United States (U.S.) results in the emission of both carbon dioxide (CO2), which damages the atmosphere, and local air pollutants<br>(LAP), which causes damage to human health and the environment. In this thesis, I assess the efficacy of different policy strategies focusing on the abatement of CO2, LAP, and both simultaneously. The thesis begins by examining whether preserving existing nuclear plants is a cost-effective means for avoiding CO2 emissions. Following the nuclear analysis, I broaden the scope of my work to include all<br>sectors of the U.S. energy system. Using the Environmental Protection Agency’s TIMES model, I simulate energy-system taxes on CO2 as well as on LAPs, including sulfur<br>dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter 2.5 micro-meters in diameter and below (PM2.5). Additionally, I compare the efficacy of LAP tax scenarios at a<br>national and regional level. Across Chapters 3-4, I compare total emissions across multiple simulated tax scenarios to a business as usual scenario. Additionally, using<br>integrated assessment reduced complexity models, I estimate damages from CO2 and LAPs emissions across these scenarios. To measure the efficiency of tax scenarios in this thesis, I model the net-benefits compared to BAU across multiple environmental policies. In Chapter 2, I examine whether preserving existing U.S. nuclear power plants is a cost-effective strategy to avoid CO2 emissions. I perform a Monte Carlo-based analysis to determine the break-even price of electricity that each U.S. nuclear plant must receive in order to avoid financial loses between 2015 and 2040. Subsequently, I model nuclear power plant revenue under four separate future prices of electricity. Under the lowest electric price trajectory, my modeled results suggest that nuclear power plants would require a subsidy in order to break-even. Under the low electric price scenario, assuming natural gas combined-cycle power plants would replace nuclear power plants, I estimate the median cost of avoided CO2 emissions to range from $18-$30 per metric ton of avoided CO2 for multi-reactor plants, and $47-$97 per metric ton of avoided CO2 for single reactor plants (2014$). In Chapter 3, I simulate business as usual as well as two CO2 tax policies from 2015 to 2030 on the United States energy system, using the TIMES optimization model. I<br>find limited near-term decarbonization opportunities outside of the power generation sector, which results in substantial and enduring CO2 tax revenue through 2030. Second,<br>because the social cost of carbon, and therefore the optimal CO2 tax, is uncertain, I perform analysis comparing the deadweight loss associated with picking the wrong, nonoptimal CO2 tax. Due to the convex nature of the CO2 abatement cost curve implicit in the TIMES model, I find that it is more efficient to tax high when the social cost of<br>carbon is low, versus taxing low when the social cost of carbon is high. Additionally, I quantify the co-benefits of LAP emissions reductions that occur under both CO2 tax<br>policies. In Chapter 4, I use energy system and integrated assessment models for air pollution to estimate the consequences of LAP and CO2 policy on technology choice,<br>emissions, and pollution damages in the U.S. economy. Chapter 4 explores various combinations of policies targeting just CO2, just LAPs, and both types of pollutants<br>simultaneously. One goal is to assess whether simultaneous tax policies on both LAPs and CO2 are needed or whether significant spillovers merit control of only LAPs or CO2.<br>I find substantial spillovers across policies, that a scenario taxing both CO2 and LAPs simultaneously produces the highest net-benefits, as opposed to scenarios that target<br>either CO2 or LAPs, and that the timing of taxes is important with regard to technology lock-in in the electric sector.<br>Also in Chapter 4, I simulate national and regional taxes levied on the emission of LAPs from the U.S. energy system. I estimate the efficiency gains, relative to BAU, from<br>taxation of LAPs under two systems: in one scenario taxes are set to the emission weighted average marginal damage on a national level and the other employs a 9-region<br>taxation system on SO2, NOx, and PM2.5, where the regions are defined according to U.S. census regions. I find that both national and regional taxes induce substantial and nearly<br>identical reductions in the emissions of SO2, NOx, and PM2.5. Importantly, across regions and sectors, there is not a substantial difference in emissions between the national and regional tax scenarios. As a result, the modeled welfare gains stemming from policy differentiation are minimal. It is important to note that the lack of an increase in net benefits<br>between the national and regional tax scenarios is likely due to the lack of additional abatement options built into TIMES, which does not allow additional regional abatement in many sectors, regardless of whether there is a substantial tax increase. <br>",2020,5/20/25 16:00,5/20/25 16:00,5/20/25 16:00,3054350 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 3054350 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, what are the competencies needed from leaders in order to address the most challenging issues facing society? How would higher education cultivate the next generation of leaders for a world of problems we currently cannot solve, and how would it be determined if some graduates were ""more prepared"" than others to face these challenges? This dissertation seeks to answer these questions through the work of two distinct manuscripts. The first argues that human processes for meaning-making play critical formative roles in the setting and solving of our most complex problems. In essence, that problem-solving can be considered as embodied acts of meaning-making. This link is made through analysis of Bruner's concept of narrative and highlights the importance played by naming and framing through one's unique perspective while attempting to interpret an ill-structured problem. The second manuscript develops a tool to measure ""systems thinking,"" a competency that describes the sort of cognitive flexibility that might be beneficial for graduates to be emerging leaders capable of addressing critical societal issues. A framework for considering systems thinking competency is presented and used as the foundation of a scenario-based assessment tool. Results from a qualitative pilot study are shown as part of introducing the tool with primary findings: (a) the tool elicited meaningful data on each of the constructs for which it was designed; (b) emergent within each construct were possible means of characterizing the data that will allow for future study of variation across respondents.

In years to come, stress arising from climate change, and the continuing risks of physical and cyberattacks on the system, will likely make resilience even more important. However, while the topic receives a great deal of attention, there is little rigorous analytical work that has assessed the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of strategies to increase power system resilience. This research adopts a mixed methods approach to identify and assess strategies for improving the resilience of power systems and thus enhance planning as the power system evolves. Chapter 2 begins by reviewing a range of resilience strategies discussed in the literature that could be deployed on the grid. The literature on this subject is scattered and unsystematic in its treatment of cost and efficacy. This chapter contributes to the resilience literature by developing a comprehensive list of strategies and summarizing what is known about their costs and efficacy. Chapter 3 has already been published in the journal Risk Analysis. It analyzes and compares a range of individual and collective strategies that could increase the resilience of power supply to residential customers on a distribution feeder by providing contingency power during large power outages of long duration. A typical (but hypothetical) town in the Upper Connecticut River Valley is modelled—we choose this region because it is susceptible to ice storms and hurricanes—to estimate the cost and performance of different resilience strategies, assuming that a large power outage of long duration occurs. This work showed the extent to which collective strategies are cheaper, and therefore highlighted the importance of developing institutional arrangements that make it easier for communities to implement those collective strategies. Chapters 4 and 5 present the first systematic analysis of empirical data about the efficacy of different resilience strategies. To do this, Chapter 4 focuses on the state of Florida, which has required utilities to make substantial investments in storm hardening to improve the resilience of their systems in the face of tropical cyclones. While these utilities compile and report to the state Public Service Commission a phenomenal amount of data on the cost and performance of their different resilience strategies, almost no analysis has been done on these data to assess whether and to what extent these investments are actually improving the power system’s resilience. After compiling fifteen years’ worth of these data for Florida’s Investor-Owned Utilities, the exploratory data analysis shows that after accounting for tropical cyclone severity, undergrounding power lines, changing pole material to non-wood and installing advanced metering infrastructure across all customers likely improve average tropical cyclone restoration time (CAIDI). Increasing annual tree trimming on the other hand does not seem to have an impact on tropical cyclone CAIDI. However, to continue performing at current levels of reliability, these utilities will have to spend more on the same activities and even more on others to continue to address the impacts of climate change and the uncertainty they induce. Informed in part by this applied data analysis, in work reported in Chapter 5 utility engineers were interviewed to extract their mental models of power system resilience, as well as their judgments regarding how to enhance resilience most effectively given the range of threats facing their systems. Operators were asked to consider the worst outage their system had experienced and then to elaborate on how implementing resilience strategies could have improved their response to this worst outage without financial barriers. Undergrounding power lines was the preferred strategy by interviewees, but also estimated to be the most expensive. Finally, participants were asked what technologies, policies and resources are especially needed by utilities to enhance their systems’ resilience, and they suggested new rate designs to account for an increase in renewables, distributed energy resources, and electrification as well as defining new policy standards for new loads and distributed generation being added to their systems. They were additionally concerned with supply chain backlogs and having enough money to do the necessary upgrades on an aging system.",2023,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,6715617 Bytes,,,,,,Investing in Power System Resilience,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 6715617 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,"160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science; FOS: Earth and related environmental sciences; 40104 Climate Change Processes; 90699 Electrical and Electronic Engineering not elsewhere classified; FOS: Electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NIDRCWH4,thesis,2014,"Liu, Tingyu; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Multi-stakeholder collaborations & biomarker development and implementation,,,,,,"The rise of genomic technologies and increasing interest in personalized medicine have triggered a renewed focus on the role of biomarkers in drug development and clinical care. While many stakeholders, including industry, regulatory agencies, patients, academia, and payers, are involved in biomarker development and use, these stakeholders reside in functional siloes that lead to fragmented outputs and efforts. Thus, although biomarker discovery is extensive, biomarker adoption in the R&D process and clinical care is slow, complex, and opaque. The gap between discovery and practice needs to be bridged by clear and consistent evidentiary standards, regulations and policies. Biomarker adoption requires a systems effort that includes active dialogue and understanding among all stakeholders. The level of discussions and resources (data, samples, expertise, financial, etc.) needed also makes this field particularly fertile for collaboration. This thesis suggests that multi-stakeholder collaborations (MSCs) can address the challenges of biomarker adoption. It describes what has been achieved in existing prominent MSCs, extracts general lessons on their contributions, and provides recommendations on the use of MSCs in drug development. Specifically, MSCs have demonstrated impact across 4 key areas: 1) data generation and establishment of standards; 2) development of scientific processes for biomarker evaluation and use; 3) the structuring of innovative operational and organizational scaffolds for collaboration; and 4) delivery of vetted regulatory recommendations and robust biomarkers for use by drug developers and clinicians. Understanding the roles, evolution, and challenges of MSCs will be important in enhancing the capacity to collaborate to address the complex challenges for biomedical innovation and healthcare outcomes.",2014,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Multi-stakeholder collaborations & biomarker development and implementation,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NK92MMTX,thesis,2013,"Antona-Makoshi, Jacobo",Reanalysis of Primate Head Impact Experiments to Clarify Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Kinematics and Thresholds,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2343162801?pq-origsite=primo,"Fatalities and severe injuries due to road traffic accidents still represent a serious health and economic issue intoday’s society. Brain injuries are the most common severe injuries and these injuries account for more than half ofthe 1.3 million traffic related deaths annually worldwide. However, improved accident avoidance systems arepredicted to mitigate and reduce future accident severity. Thus, the number of traffic related deaths and severeinjuries would be reduced and therefore a focus shift towards long-term disabling injuries is expected. One of themost common of such injuries is mild traumatic brain injury.To develop effective countermeasures aimed at reducing traumatic brain injuries, it is essential to understandhead-neck and brain kinematics at impacts to be taken into account in the development of injury criteria and theestablishment of thresholds. With this purpose, experiments comprising animals, used as human surrogates, aredeemed essential and historically, head impact experiments on non-human primates have been carried out. Some ofthese experimental results have been scaled to suit humans and were used in the development of the head injurycriterion, currently in use in the FMVSS 208 US regulation for motor vehicles.This head injury criterion has been used for decades, but is still criticised for not considering many factors thatare important to brain injury. Such factors include the impact direction and area of contact, stiffness of theimpacting surface, and rotational accelerations induced by oblique impacts or when the torso is restrained.Therefore, alternative or complementary criteria that consider rotational acceleration of the head have beenproposed in combination with brain tissue injury criteria, for human head finite element models. The finite elementmodels are currently undergoing validation with reconstructions of real-life sports and traffic accidents, as well asscaled animal injury data. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the methods used to capture head kinematics and detailedbrain injury location and severity from real-life events has limitations. The existing criteria also fail to capture thehead-neck kinematics that causes the brain injuries. Moreover, the methods used to scale animal data to humansare not reliable.The ultimate goal of this study is to generate knowledge that contributes to the development of MTBI criteriaand associated limits that will, when properly applied, reduce the number of moderate brain injuries due to closedhead impacts. This thesis aims at proposing improved criteria that account for the head-neck and brain kinematicsthat occur during brain trauma and to provide thresholds for concussions. This will be facilitated by numericalreconstruction of past head trauma experiments using primates.By re-analysing the existing primate trauma experiments, using a finite element model of these specimens, thereliability of global head injury criteria available in literature was evaluated. This was done by simulating andanalysing sub-sets of frontal and occipital primate head impacts; selected from large series of trauma experimentspreviously conducted at the Japan Automobile Research Institute. Based on the simulation results, the brain injurykinematics hypothesised when the former experiments were analysed is supported: concussions occur due tophysical stress to the brainstem. Based on these findings, brain tissue injury thresholds were also proposed.Assuming that tissue thresholds are the same for non-human primates and humans, these results can be used tointerpret results obtained with human finite element models without scaling.In the future, these results are expected to be used as references for virtual safety assessment and to provide the basis for further development of protective strategies for humans.",2013,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Reanalysis of Primate Head Impact Experiments to Clarify Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Kinematics and Thresholds ISBN: 9781392563601,,,,,Mechanics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NP9DYP3H,thesis,2021,"Cheng, Chung Hon M.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",A tale of two sovereignties: public health and fundamental rights in COVID-era judicial reasoning,,,,,,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront of law important questions about what to do when public health and constitutionally-guaranteed rights-or public health and political sovereignties-come into conflict. In liberal democracies, courts are usually the authority tasked with resolving clashes of this type. This thesis offers an account of how judges in the United States and other countries have balanced the need for public health protection with the constitutional rights that citizens have been promised. By highlighting the tensions left unresolved by a foundational U.S. case, Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), I find new angles to analyze the different ways in which U.S. courts have negotiated this balance, which is mainly by using various forms of purely legal reasoning to justify the wholesale embrace of one type of sovereignty over the other. In France, the Conseil d'État exerts continuous effort to balance the two sovereignties, holding public health authorities to high standards of reasoning; in Austria, the Constitutional Court nominally upholds public health sovereignty but nonetheless often strikes down measures on grounds rooted in political sovereignty; and in Taiwan, courts have leaned heavily toward ratifying public health sovereignty. These different approaches to balancing the tension between the two sovereignties further point toward underlying divergences in the different social compacts implicated in each jurisdiction, as well as competing visions of the individual as a political and as a biological subject.",2021,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,A tale of two sovereignties,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: A tale of two sovereignties : public health and fundamental rights in COVID-era judicial reasoning,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NPTZ2DF4,journalArticle,2024,"Hanig, Lily",Planning for Equitable Outcomes During Periods of Disruption in the Transportation Sector,,,,10.1184/R1/25651422.V1,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Planning_for_Equitable_Outcomes_During_Periods_of_Disruption_in_the_Transportation_Sector/25651422/1,"Disruptions to transportation tend to disproportionately impact the most vulnerable groups, making equity an important consideration when studying disruptions. In this dissertation, we investigate the equity impact of external changes in transportation (e.g., COVID-19 and dependence on public transportation) and the impact of internal disruptions to transportation (e.g., technology innovations, such as vehicle electrification and automation). We investigated COVID-19 because it created unprecedented upheaval in transportation patterns and revealed vulnerabilities in the transportation system that were not discernible pre-pandemic. Looking forward, the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) will present a lower-emissions alternative to internal combustion engines. This is significant because light-duty vehicles are the largest sector source of carbon emissions in the US. However, vehicle electrification will change how people re-fuel their vehicles and will impact grid operations. We investigate EV adoption and infrastructure to discern who will be left behind and how the EV movement will impact the state of the grid.  In the second chapter, we investigate the role that public transportation potentially played as a vector for spreading COVID-19 and assess the trade-offs of potential alternatives to crowding on public transit. We find that some trips have demands that exceed their COVID-19 passenger limit, where the driver must decide: 1) leaving a passenger without a ride or 2) allowing them on the bus and increasing COVID-19 risk. We consider five alternatives for alleviating overcapacity and compare the trade-offs of each. We use transit ridership and COVID-19 data from the spring of 2020 by combining transportation data and a stochastic epidemiological model of COVID-19 in a Monte Carlo Analysis. Our results show that 4% of county cases were contracted on the bus or from a bus rider, and a disproportionate amount (52%) were from overcapacity trips. The risk of contracting COVID-19 on the bus was low but worth mitigating.  In the third chapter, we use the COVID-19 stay-at-home order to study the dependence on Transportation Network Companies (TNC) by income of the trip origin. TNCs such as Uber and Lyft set out to provide transportation that was not fulfilled by private vehicles or public transit. The social value of TNCs for essential trips is difficult to discern in normal conditions. The COVID-19 stay-at-home order is used as a natural experiment to investigate the heterogeneous ability to avoid TNCs by income areas of trip origins. We measure the sensitivity of different populations’ ability to respond to policies and to avoid TNC trips (e.g., early stay-at-home orders) using a difference-in-difference style regression. We fill a gap in the literature by evaluating the role TNCs play in serving unavoidable and essential trips. We find that high-income community areas showed greater sensitivity to the stay-at-home order with a 56% greater decrease in TNC ridership during the stay-at-home order compared to low-income community areas.  In the fourth chapter, we investigate the impact of federal investments in public charging station access for Electric vehicles (EVs) to find where coverage is lacking and which parts of the country are left behind by federal spending. EV charging stations need EVs to be profitable, while consumers hesitate to purchase EVs if there is a lack of charging infrastructure. The federal government has committed to investing up to $7.5 billion into publicly accessible EV charging infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Several highway corridors are designated as alternative fuel corridors (AFC) and are prioritized for fast charging station development. We develop a novel metric, ‘consecutive coverage’, to compute the percent of roads (weighted by traffic) that are consecutively accessible, with?out large gaps in charging stations, within 500 miles of each starting county. We use our metric to answer several questions: What is the state of consecutive EV charging coverage from each county? What is the increase in coverage per state when the federally designated corridors have fast charging stations? The output of our model is the percent of national coverage reached for each county in the US. In 2023, only 10% of counties have minimum viable coverage, with at least 75% of highways consecutively covered for long-distance travel. If all AFCs have fast charging stations, 94% of counties will have consecutive coverage of fast chargers for at least 75% of travel.  In the fifth chapter, we look at the impact of EVs on grid capacity expansion, generation mix, and emissions. There are several EV policies and federal goals aimed at reducing carbon emissions; however, to understand the impact of EV adoption on carbon emissions, we investigate the impact of high EV penetration on the grid needs by endogenously modeling dispatch and capacity expansion. We find that high EV penetration scenarios (the Biden Administration 2021 EV sales goal, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2024 fuel standards, and net zero by 2050) have higher consequential emissions compared to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (inducing a higher carbon intensity of the grid). However, the consequential per-vehicle emissions fall over time to nearly reach zero per-vehicle consequential emissions by 2050 compared to the IRA reference. The grid’s carbon intensity is anticipated to decrease significantly over the next decade leading to a reduction in consequential EV emissions of high EV policies; this widens the gap between per vehicle EV grid emissions and displaced tailpipe emission out through 2032, at which point the consequential per vehicle emissions stays consistent across high EV scenarios. We model the lowest EV scenario (no policy intervention) as reaching emissions low enough to trigger the phase-out of IRA renewable tax credits. The higher EV policies maintain positive grid emissions beyond the IRA but have significantly lower displaced tailpipe emissions for 2026 onward.",2024,5/20/25 17:09,5/20/25 17:09,5/20/25 17:09,41872081 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 41872081 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NT3IXBBZ,thesis,2017,"Gan, Yu",Assessing the Impacts of Mineral and Hydrocarbon Resources Exploitation and Consumption,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Assessing_the_Impacts_of_Mineral_and_Hydrocarbon_Resources_Exploitation_and_Consumption/6714860/1,"The exploitation of natural resources lays the foundation for the economic and social development, but also is the root cause of various environmental issues. The study aims to analyze the process of natural resource exploitation, to optimize the extraction and utilization processes, maximizing their economic and social values while reducing the accompanied negative environmental impacts. This dissertation focuses on the impacts of exploitation of mineral and hydrocarbon resources in emerging countries on global warming effect, economy and society. Chapter 2 of the dissertation analyzes the life cycle GHG emissions associated with iron ore mining and processing in China. With rapid economic development and nationwide urbanization, the iron ore demand grows while the ore grade declines significantly, leading to the increasing GHG emissions from iron ore production. Results of the research show that the mean life-cycle GHG emissions for Chinese iron ore production are 270 kg CO2e/tonne, with a 90% confidence interval of 210 to 380 kg CO2e/tonne. The two largest contributors to overall GHG emissions are agglomeration (60%) and ore processing (23%). Iron content (ore grade) varies from 15% to 60% and is the largest contributor (40%) to the uncertainty of the results. Chapter 3 explores the impact of China’s outsourcing of iron resources on the global warming effect. This chapter applies the same life cycle assessment framework of Chinese iron ore in Chapter 2 to Australian and Brazilian ore production, and compares the LCA results of Australian and Brazilian ore to Chinese iron ore. Results show that among the three iron ore sources, Australian iron ore is the optimal choice for reducing GHG emissions. The mean life cycle GHG emissions of Australian iron ore fines is 60% less than that of Chinese iron ore fines (42 kg CO2e/tonne versus 110 kg CO2e/tonne). There is no significant difference between the imported iron ores sourced from Brazil versus the China’s domestic supplied iron ores, but if Chinese ore grade falls below 20% in the future, Brazilian iron ores would be preferred. The largest source of GHG emissions for Australian and Brazilian iron ores comes from ocean shipping (accounts for 58% and 75% of the overall GHG emissions respectively). Chapter 4 studies the impacts of the exploitation of pre-salt natural gas in Brazil. Natural gas production and its associated downstream industries are currently underdeveloped in Brazil, while the on-going exploitation of deep-sea pre-salt reservoir would potentially change the current situation. This study analyzes the impacts of the increasing pre-salt gas production and potential natural gas use pathways in downstream industries. Results reveal that GHG emissions associated with pre-salt gas production vary according to the stage of reservoir exploitation. At the early stage, the estimate of GHG emissions is 5.4 (90%CI: 4.5~6.4) gCO2e/MJ, and the value becomes 7.1 (90% CI: 6.3~8.0) gCO2e/MJ for the intermediate stage. All six natural gas use pathways analyzed in the study emit less GHG on average than their current corresponding incumbent pathways. The mean GHG emissions reduction from natural gas use for power generation, nitrogen fertilizer production, methanol production, as the reducing agent for steel making, ethylene-based polymer production, heavy-duty vehicle fueling are estimated to be 0.83, 2.3, 0.38, 35, 2.6 and 0.078 million tonnes CO2 equivalent per year, respectively.

NTGQP689,thesis,2013,"Kwon, Ohchan; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Bridging the innovation gap through funding: the case of MIT Deshpande Center,,,,,,"The idea of gap-funding program, in which academic scientists are given research funding for developing proof-of-concept and prototype, has recently attracted attention as a policy measure of commercializing academic science. While the earliest programs of its kind were initiated about a decade ago, we still lack empirical evidence on its effectiveness. Using the detailed dataset of the gap-funding program at MIT, the Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, I observe two mechanisms that gap-funding program can facilitate academic commercialization. First, by providing research funding that allows academic freedom of problem selection and mode of disclosure, gap-funding program attracts applications from junior faculty members with commercialization interests. Second, providing research funding for prototype development and networking opportunities with industry practitioners increases the likelihood that an academic invention results in start-up founding. Moreover, its positive impact is larger for inventions without intellectual property rights protection, partly because of the reduced level of uncertainty after prototype development. However, awarding gap-funding does not increase the likelihood of technology licensing to incumbent firms. Together, I argue that gap-funding program can be a useful policy toolkit for regional economic development by fostering academic entrepreneurship.",2013,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,Bridging the innovation gap through funding,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2013 S.M.,Book Title: Bridging the innovation gap through funding : the case of MIT Deshpande Center,,,,,Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation (Massachusetts Institute of Technology),,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physical bases for a price relationship are examined. An econometric modeling exercise seeks to establish whether a stable price relationship exists and to define it through the use of a vector error correction model. The model identifies strong evidence of cointegration between the crude oil and natural gas spot price series in the United States. It conditions the predicted natural gas price volatility through exogenous variables related to weather and supply. Once identified, the relationship is clarified more efficiently through the implementation of a conditional error correction model. The model is then utilized to simulate the effects of weather shocks, seasonality, supply deviations and hurricane activity on the cointegrating relationship between crude oil and natural gas. Finally, an analysis is conducted to test whether the relationship shifts over time to new equilibria. The results of the series of exercises suggest that crude oil and natural gas prices have moved together historically and statistical analysis supports the assumption that the two price series continued to be cointegrated through the end of 2008. The analysis presents evidence that the relationship shifts over time to new equilibria, and the data suggest that these new eqilibria are likewise stable.",2010,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: The relationship between crude oil and natural gas spot prices and its stability over time,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NW5BU4UL,thesis,2015,"Wolff, Josephine Charlotte Paulina; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",Classes of defense for computer systems,,,,,,"Computer security incidents often involve attackers acquiring a complex sequence of escalating capabilities and executing those capabilities across a range of different intermediary actors in order to achieve their ultimate malicious goals. However, popular media accounts of these incidents, as well as the ensuing litigation and policy proposals, tend to focus on a very narrow defensive landscape, primarily individual centralized defenders who control some of the capabilities exploited in the earliest stages of these incidents. This thesis proposes two complementary frameworks for defenses against computer security breaches -- one oriented around restricting the computer-based access capabilities that adversaries use to perpetrate those breaches and another focused on limiting the harm that those adversaries ultimately inflict on their victims. Drawing on case studies of actual security incidents, as well as the past decade of security incident data at MIT, it analyzes security roles and defense design patterns related to these broad classes of defense for application designers, administrators, and policy-makers. Application designers are well poised to undertake access defense by defining and distinguishing malicious and legitimate forms of activity in the context of their respective applications. Policy-makers can implement some harm limitation defenses by monitoring and regulating money flows, and also play an important role in collecting the data needed to expand understanding of the sequence of events that lead up to successful security incidents and inform which actors can and should effectively intervene as defenders. Organizations and administrators, meanwhile, occupy an in-between defensive role that spans both access and harm in addressing digital harms, or harms that are directly inflicted via computer capabilities, through restrictions on crucial intermediate harms and outbound information flows. The comparative case analysis ultimately points to a need to broaden defensive roles and responsibilities beyond centralized access defense and defenders, as well as the visibility challenges compounding externalities for defenders who may lack not only the incentives to intervene in such incidents but also the necessary knowledge to figure out how best to intervene.",2015,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology, Management, and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: Classes of defense for computer systems,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis aims to explore the tradeoffs of various organic waste management strategies in the urban Indian context, specifically using a case study analysis of the waste system in the city of Pune. Door-to-door, primary, and secondary collection and four technologies for treating organics (landfilling, composting, anaerobic digestion, and pelletization) are analyzed with regard to cost and environmental performance. Because decentralized waste system architectures minimize transportation and allows wastepickers to maintain jobs, particular emphasis is made in this thesis to understand the cost and environmental implications treatment at a range of scales. To determine the quantity and composition of waste, we conducted waste audits of MSW that was collected from 2,650 households during two different seasons. Per-capita MSW generation in Pune was found to be 134, 309, and 401 grams/day for the lower, middle, and upper income residents, respectively. Of these totals, 80%, 66%, and 69% of the MSW was biodegradable. Given that middle and upper income residents generate 2.3 to 3 times what lower income residents generate, India can expect to see a significant increase in waste volumes as its population becomes wealthier. By comparing the spatial footprints of the technologies at a range of scales, it was found that pelletization of organic MSW (although it is not a fully developed technology) has great potential to reduce the spatial footprint of organic waste management. Cost modeling is used to identify the drivers of cost for each process and to identify the leastcost options. The cost per ton of waste managed using anaerobic digestion, composting, and pelletization decreases significantly with larger scale of treatment. Alternative organics management technologies used at small scales (less than 0.5 TPD) are more expensive than landfilling; however, if a facility of at least 0.5 TPD is used, anaerobic digestion is less expensive than landfilling. Pelletization and composting become less expensive than landfilling at the scale of 5 TPD and 200 TPD, respectively. Although the average cost of centralized organic waste systems is lower, the difference in cost between the lowest-cost decentralized systems and lowest-cost centralized systems was relatively small. A review of the relevant literature is used to identify the global warming impacts of organic waste processing. The global warming potential (GWP) of anaerobic digestion, pelletization, composting, and landfilling is estimated to be -51, -42, 38, and 510 kg CO-eq/ton, respectively. A city looking to minimize its contribution to global warming could achieve significant reductions in emissions by biodigesting food waste and peltetizing yard waste. Such systems would have a net greenhouse gas emissions savings of over 750 tons CO2-eq each year. Of the technologies assessed, anaerobic digestion (at scales of 5 TPD or larger) has the best combination of cost and GWP performance. However, because woody material cannot be digested, pelletization (at 10 TPD plants) has the best combination of cost and GWP performance specifically for handling yard waste. These findings suggest that for handling organic MSW, anaerobic digestion in combination with pelletization produces the best combination of cost and GWP performance.",2015,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,Identifying sustainable organic management systems in urban India,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 S.M.,"Book Title: Identifying sustainable organic management systems in urban India : case study of Pune, India",,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of how the costs of doing HSI work within a program can be estimated. The research is divided into two parts. In the first part, problem formulation, literature from several relevant domains is first reviewed. Next a descriptive case study is conducted on the development of the Pratt and Whitney F 119 engine. It examines activities done to support HSI up to engineering and manufacturing development and concludes that, among other factors, HSI in requirements are a major driver of effort. This conclusion leads to work on the integration of HSI into the counting of requirements for an existing systems engineering cost model. In the second part of the research, implementation and validation, two workshops are conducted to assess how HSI considerations are addressed in real-world requirements engineering. The first workshop tests existing requirements counting guidelines, identifies weakness, and suggests improvement. The second workshop applies the Wideband Delphi method to generate consensus between stakeholders in order to deliver a quantitative estimate of HSI effort. The workshop also demonstrates that stakeholders perceive functional and nonfunctional requirements as driving effort in similar ways, a conclusion that challenges a widely-held belief that nonfunctional requirements are less significant than functional ones. The research done in the case study and workshops results in improvements to the existing systems engineering cost model, and an application of the model is presented.

P36DSRYQ,thesis,2013,"Cross-Call, Daniel Frederick; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Matching energy storage to small island electricity systems: a case study of the Azores,,,,,,"Island economies rely almost entirely on imported diesel and fuel oil to supply their energy needs, resulting in significant economic and environmental costs. In recognition of the benefits of clean energy development, many islands are pursuing ambitious goals for renewable energy. For example, the Azores Islands of Portugal have set a goal to achieve 75% renewable energy by 2018. Despite significant environmental and economic benefits, however, the introduction of renewable energy sources introduces new operating challenges to island power systems, including intermittent and uncertain generation patterns. This research investigates energy storage on small island power systems under scenarios of increasing penetrations of variable-output wind. The analysis applies a least-cost unit commitment model to three Azores island networks (Sdo Miguel, Faial and Flores), in order to determine expected cost savings from introducing energy storage onto those systems. Modeling results indicate that renewable energy coupled with energy storage can produce significant savings in operating costs on island electricity systems- above those levels achieved from renewable generation alone. Furthermore, the research suggests that storage power (in terms of available megawatts for discharging energy) is more critical than storage capacity (megawatt-hours of available storage) for achieving costs savings and clean energy goals. The largest impacts from storage will come from relatively small-sized storage installations, above which there is a diminishing return from storage.",2013,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,Matching energy storage to small island electricity systems,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2013 S.M.,Book Title: Matching energy storage to small island electricity systems : a case study of the Azores,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To meet the needs of thoseusers, it is important to expand capacity of networks that provide Internet access in cost effectiveways. This capacity has traditionally been provided by cellular networks. However,expanding the capacity of those networks alone may not be the most cost-effective way to meetthe present and future growth of mobile Internet under some circumstances. In this dissertation,we show that networks of connected vehicles can be an important way to complement thecapacity of cellular networks to provide mobile Internet access under several scenarios.Connected vehicles may soon be widely deployed, forming mesh networks of short-rangeconnections among vehicles and between vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Theseconnections are collectively referred to as vehicle-to-everything, or V2X. Deployment ofconnected vehicles and infrastructure is primarily intended to enhance road safety, and the U.S.Department of Transportation has recently proposed a mandate of V2X devices in vehiclesusing Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) technology. Other applications are alsoenvisioned that include Internet access in vehicles connecting to roadside infrastructure servingas gateways to the Internet.In this work, we find that V2X-based networks are more cost-effective than cellular toprovide Internet access, in scenarios which DSRC devices are mandated in vehicles to enhanceroad safety. This is true initially for densely populated urban areas, but over time V2X-basednetworks would be cost-effective in less populated areas as well, as long as Internet traffic orpenetration of V2X devices grow as expected.Local and state governments are expected to deploy roadside infrastructure for safetyapplications. If that infrastructure is shared with Internet Service Providers for a fee, then V2XABSTRACT based networks are cost-effective in locations with even lower population densities than thelocations where it is cost-effective to deploy infrastructure for Internet access only. Moreover,the sharing fee could help governments save in infrastructure costs. We find the pricingstrategies that maximize either cost-effectiveness or government savings. We estimate thatgovernments could save about one-fifth of the total cost to deploy safety infrastructurenationwide in the U.S., if fees are set to maximize government savings. Although we find thatthese prices may differ from the pricing strategy that maximizes cost-effectiveness, maximizinggovernment savings results in near-optimal cost-effectiveness.The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has allocated 75 MHz of spectrum to beused exclusively by DSRC devices, and it has been hotly debated whether all or part of thatbandwidth should be shared with unlicensed devices. We find that it is highly efficient to shareany spectrum allocated to V2X communications beyond the portion of that spectrum that isneeded for safety-critical DSRC messages. V2X and unlicensed devices require up to 50% lessbandwidth on shared spectrum to achieve given throughputs, compared to V2X and unlicenseddevices using separate bands. We conclude that the spectrum available for V2X should bemaintained or increased, as long as much of that spectrum is shared with non-V2X devices.Conclusions are derived from an engineering-economic approach, in which part of theassumptions are based on data from a citywide deployment of connected vehicles in Portugal.The data is used in a detailed and realistic packet-level simulation model of V2X-basednetworks used to provide Internet access with DSRC technology. In some scenarios, thesimulation also includes unlicensed devices using Wi-Fi technology. The results of the networksimulation are then fed into engineering-economic models to compare costs of V2X-basednetworks with costs of macrocellular networks to carry given amounts of Internet traffic, and toestimate other measures such as government revenues and spectrum usage. Those measureshelp inform decisions about where and when to deploy V2X-based networks, decisions about whether and how to promote public-private partnerships to deploy V2X infrastructure, anddecisions about sharing spectrum used for V2X communications with non-V2X devices.",12/1/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,Connected Vehicles for Internet Access,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7411433.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These chapters explore how adding flexibility to power plants equipped with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) affects system costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, how grid-scale electricity storage affects system CO2 emissions as a power system decarbonizes, and how distributed solar photovoltaic (distributed PV) electricity generation suppresses wholesale electricity prices. In each chapter, I address these questions through a combination of power system optimization, statistics, and techno-economic analysis, and tie my findings to policy implications. In Chapter 2, I compare the cost-effectiveness of “flexible” CCS retrofits to other compliance strategies with the U.S. Clean Power Plan (CPP) and a hypothetical stronger CPP. Relative to “normal” CCS, “flexible” CCS retrofits include solvent storage that allows the generator to temporarily eliminate the CCS parasitic load and increase the generator’s net efficiency, capacity, and ramp rate. Using a unit commitment and economic dispatch (UCED) model, I find that flexible CCS achieves more cost-effective emissions reductions than normal CCS under the CPP and stronger CPP, but that flexible CCS is less cost-effective than other compliance strategies under both reduction targets. In Chapter 3, I conduct a detailed comparison of how flexible versus normal CCS retrofits affect total system costs and CO2 emissions under a moderate and strong CO2 emission limit. Given that a key benefit of flexible CCS relative to normal CCS is increased reserve provision, I break total system costs into generation, reserve, and CCS capital costs. Using a UCED model, I find that flexible CCS retrofits reduce total system costs relative to normal CCS retrofits under both emission limits. Furthermore, 40-80% of these cost reductions come from reserve cost reductions. Accounting for costs and CO2 emissions, though, flexible CCS poses a trade-off to policymakers under the moderate emission limit, as flexible CCS increases system CO2 emissions relative to normal CCS. No such trade-off exists under the stronger emission limit, as flexible CCS reduces system CO2 emissions and costs relative to normal CCS. In Chapter 4, I quantify how storage affects operational CO2 emissions as a power system decarbonizes under a moderate and strong CO2 emission limit through 2045. In so doing, I aim to better understand how storage transitions from increasing CO2 emissions in historic U.S. systems to enabling deeply decarbonized systems. Additionally, under each target I compare how storage affects CO2 emissions when participating in only energy, only reserve, and energy and reserve markets. Using a capacity expansion (CE) model to forecast fleet changes through 2045 and a UCED model to quantify how storage affects system CO2 emissions, I find that storage quickly transitions from increasing to decreasing CO2 emissions under the moderate and strong emission limits. Whether storage provides only energy, only reserves, or energy and reserves drives large differences in the magnitude, but not the direction, of the effect of storage on CO2 emissions. In Chapter 5, I quantify a benefit of distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation often overlooked by value of solar studies, namely the market price response. By displacing high-cost marginal generators, distributed PV generation reduces wholesale electricity prices, which in turn reduces utilities’ energy procurement costs. Using 2013 through 2015 data from California including a database of all distributed PV systems in the three California investor owned utilities, we estimate historic hourly distributed PV generation in California, then link that generation to reduced wholesale electricity prices via linear regression. From 2013 through 2015, we find that distributed PV suppressed historic median hourly LMPs by up to $2.7-3.1/MWh, yielding avoided costs of up to $650-730 million. These avoided costs are smaller than but on the order of other avoided costs commonly included in value of solar studies, so merit inclusion in future studies to properly value distributed PV.",12/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716132.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Topical invention is the procedurally structured and/or organized thinking-out of propositions in text, speech, or other symbolic products; it is the structured and systematized method of invention originally developed by Aristotle, often referred to by the Greek topoi or the Latin loci. Although it goes by many names in recent history, topical invention has a structure based on Michael Leff’s definition of topical invention that shares five common aspects: data, claims or conclusions, linkages, sources, and topics. Data are some set of contextual knowledge, claims or conclusions are statements that express a truth value based on data, linkages are the expressed or implicit relationship between data and claims or conclusions, sources are methods for finding linkages, and topics are the naming of discrete entities in a system for invention. This history selects texts dealing with topical invention in U.S. rhetorical studies discourse published between 1914 and 2014. A text was considered to be dealing with topical invention if it had an explicit discussion of topical invention or a discussion matching the structure of topical invention. U.S. rhetorical studies is the discourse community present in journals published by the four major United States professional societies studying rhetoric—the National Communication Association, the National Council of Teachers of English, the Rhetoric Society of America, and the American Society for the History of Rhetoric—and the publications Philosophy & Rhetoric and Rhetoric Review. Texts were selected and interpreted using a deconstructive reading and pluralistic and idiographic ideologies of history. Although work on topical invention in the last century has neither a single coherent concept nor consistent terminology, it maintains a deep structure in which topics identify the sources for linkages that connect claims and conclusions to the data upon which they are based. This structure can be used to identify instances of topical invention in scholarly discussions and to analyze the shifts, trends, developments, and changes in topical invention over the last 100 years. The changes to, various conceptions of, and potential future developments for topical invention as evidenced by its shifting structure across the last century are presented in this dissertation.",2015,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: A brief history of topical invention in 20th century United States rhetorical studies ISBN: 9781339119472,,,,,Communication; History; Rhetoric,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PAISCDP9,thesis,2015,"Acocella, Angela J.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",System model of small-scale gas-to-methanol conversion by engine reformers,,,,,,"As global energy demands grow and environmental concerns over resource extraction methods intensify, high impact solutions are becoming increasingly essential. Venting and flaring of associated natural gas represents significant environmental and financial losses yet it continues in the North Dakota Bakken oil play. The valuable gas resource is wasted due to unfavorable economics and limited pipeline capacity. Similarly in India, underdeveloped gas transport infrastructure and restrictive regulatory frameworks prevent distribution and marketing of natural gas from the northeast regions, leaving it stranded in marginal fields. This thesis establishes a techno-economic model, utilizing Aspen Plus chemical processing software, and a discounted cash flow model to estimate economic feasibility of implementing MIT engine reformer-based gas-to-liquids (GTL) systems in the US or India. The system reforms natural gas via partial oxidation into synthesis gas (syngas) in the cylinders of an internal combustion engine, and can significantly reduce capital costs over conventional GTL reforming processes. The engine is operated in fuel rich conditions to generate the syngas, which is synthesized into methanol and dimethyl ether (DME). Once produced on-site, these liquids are more easily transported than gases. This study assesses the regulatory structures surrounding the upstream methane resource and downstream end product marketability for three scenarios: use of DME to replace existing local (1) diesel and (2) liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or (3) sale of methanol as a commodity chemical on domestic or global markets. The analysis shows the system is economical in both locations. In the US, the minimum economically efficient production capacity with a 1-2 year payback period is 400,000- 860,000 standard cubic feet per day (scfpd) of natural gas for the range of end use scenarios considered. Differences in costs and product market characteristics in India result in a minimum efficient capacity of 330,000-810,000 scfpd of natural gas for the three scenarios.",2015,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: System model of small-scale gas-to-methanol conversion by engine reformers,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PED88N6J,thesis,2015,"Yiu, Lisa","Integration in China's public schools: Citizenship, schooling, and rural migrant youth in urban China",,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1720329926?pq-origsite=primo,"Worldwide, there is increasing concern towards the societal integration of youth with irregular citizenship status, whose migration as long-term residents is unwanted even though their parents' economic labor is valued. New forms of fragmented citizenship emerge as globalization processes rupture the relationship between residence and citizenship rights. The loosening of borders permit migrants to enter as workers, but deny political and legal status to their children. With limited citizenship rights to access education and socio-economic mobility opportunities, these immigrant youth face formidable structural barriers for societal assimilation. How does citizenship status shape educational access and societal outcomes for children in the societies where they call ""home,"" but lack full citizenship rights? The four papers of my study investigate citizenship as a global axis of educational inequality through a case study on China. With China's surge of rural-to-urban migration, the social integration of 20 million rural migrant children has emerged as an urgent policy issue since the 1990s. Rural migrant children, who are born in the cities or move to the cities with their migrant worker parents, are unable to access urban public schools. Migrant youth's exclusion from accessing urban schooling originates from the hukou system, a domestic system of rural and urban citizenship that excludes rural hukou holders from urban school access since the 1950s. The hukou system—which has been compared to national citizenship regimes in other nation states — remains a significant factor in shaping the educational and, thus, life opportunities of migrants in Shanghai, Beijing, and other large migrant-receiving metropolises. Since citizenship regimes are a powerful state instrument that exclude foreigners, the challenges that migrant youth face in obtaining social services in Chinese cities are comparable to those of transnational immigration in other societies, particularly undocumented immigration. Moreover, as local citizenship constitutes an important axis of educational stratification in China, China's political and institutional responses to migrant children thus provides a critical lens into the controversies and challenges confronting governments worldwide with the provision of schooling opportunities to those at the margins of society. The four papers of my dissertation apply different methodologies—critical discourse analysis, multivariate analysis, and grounded theory techniques—to investigate the integration of rural migrant children into urban schools and, more broadly, urban society. Collectively, the chapters offer distinct, but complementary perspectives on how rural migrant youth's negative experiences in public schools may actually undermine their integration within Chinese urban society. I draw upon rare interview access with municipal policymakers in Beijing and Shanghai during 2011-13; a collection of central and local government documents; 2009 survey data of Beijing schools from Peking's China Institute for Educational Finance Research; and 2011-13 ethnographic data in two Shanghai middle schools. As one of the first projects on Chinese rural migrant adolescents' experiences of school integration by a U.S.-based scholar, my research contributes new insights on the hukou citizenship debates and a unique perspective on China's future. My findings illustrate the influence of global paradigms on municipal citizenship reforms, which expand educational access to migrant children; the relative importance of family background above school context in shaping migrant children's educational expectations; the disadvantage of citizenship status in receiving fewer opportunities to learn in the classroom; and migrant youth's development of a citizenship-based, reactive identity in response to school marginalization. Importantly, my dissertation reveals how school exposure may undermine migrant youth's socio-cultural assimilation and offers important policy lessons to governments faced with the challenge of integrating immigrant youth. Further, it makes distinctive contributions to the understanding of processes of educational policy borrowing across nations; the interdisciplinary study of education, migration and nation-building; constructivist analysis of social identity; and the ethnographic study of society-school relationship.",2015,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,Integration in China's public schools,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Integration in China's public schools: Citizenship, schooling, and rural migrant youth in urban China ISBN: 9781339155364",,,,,"Comparative education; Education and state; Education, Compulsory; Educational attainment; Educational change; Educational equalization; Educational sociology; Public schools; Teenagers; Urban schools",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Second, it estimates the costs and benefits of the SA technology when building out a wireless network. Then, it presents a study case to compare the feasibility of SA technology versus spectrum refarming. Furthermore, the thesis studies SA’s impact on valuation of spectrum by operators. Finally, it discusses the implications of SA on spectrum policies. Results show that LTE systems that use spectrum aggregation over fragmented blocks of spectrum can have better performance compared to Independent Carrier (IC) systems. In addition, aggregating carriers from multiple bands could permit the system to have a better performance in certain circumstances. Moreover, SA technology could have a positive impact on the benefits and costs of nationwide LTE networks. In a case study for using SA over fragmented spectrum in the TV band, the advantages and disadvantages of the use of the technology versus repacking the spectrum physically to create contiguous band are observed and discussed. After empirically studying operators’ willingness to pay for contiguous and low-frequency spectrum, simulation is used to measure the impact of SA on the operators’ valuation for spectrum blocks. Results show that the technology could lead to more linear valuation of spectrum units. Finally, SA impact on spectrum policies is studied and specific recommendations are given to regulators to help exploit fragmentation of spectrum through the technology and encourage fairer access to spectrum by competitors.",5/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,Exploring Spectrum Aggregation Technology,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716597.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I focus in the case of Portugal, where by 2006 the Portuguese government had completed a major initiative that upgraded the Internet connection of all public schools, replacing the previously existing connections by broadband. In the first study I focus on the direct effects the introduction of broadband in middle schools had in students' performance. I find that high levels of broadband use in schools are detrimental for 9th grade national exam scores. For the average broadband use in schools, exam scores reduce about 0.97 of a standard deviation from 2005 to 2009. I also find suggestive evidence that the way schools allow students to use the Internet affects students' performance. In particular, students in schools that block access to websites such as YouTube perform relatively better. In the second study, I look at spillover effects of providing broadband to schools in home Internet adoption. I assess the magnitude of these effects using household level data on home Internet penetration and Internet traffic in all schools in Portugal. I find that school broadband use contributes directly to a higher adoption rate in households with children. During 2008 and 2009 school Internet use increased the probability of adopting Internet by 20% in households with children, while no statistically significant effect was found in households without children. In the third study I focus on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills and on the dynamics of computer and Internet use inside the household. I provide empirical evidence that the presence of children or young adults in the household does contribute to an increase in the likelihood of having a computer or Internet at home, but does not contribute to an increase in use patterns and skills. Moreover, I find that the presence of children and young adults is associated with lower levels of computer and Internet use and skills.",8/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Broadband in Schools,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715037.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Spring 2014, a large outbreak of MERS originated in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - concentrated in nosocomial settings in Riyadh and Jeddah - resulting in over 300 infections. We used publicly available data from the Saudi Ministry of Health and World Health Organization to examine the outbreak potential of MERS-Coronavirus and to explore possible risk factors for MERS-related mortality within the context of Saudi Arabia. We also investigated how differential case characteristics between patients reported during the Spring 2014 Saudi MERS outbreak and those reported during non-outbreak periods may provide insight into the propagation of future outbreaks. We found that the Spring 2014 Saudi MERS outbreak was likely due to a super-spreading event, in which a small fraction of cases caused the vast majority of secondary transmissions. Though most cases infected 1 or fewer other individuals, propensity for super-spreading suggests that the outbreak potential of MERS-Coronavirus is significant and that future outbreaks of similar size are expected to occur. Furthermore, we found that early administration of supportive care may be essential to survival once an individual is infected with MERS-Coronavirus; this is especially true for the elderly, who are at increased risk of death. Thus, surveillance - especially among the elderly, who are at increased risk for MERS-related death - is key to reducing fatality. Surveillance is also integral to detecting zoonotic introduction (i.e. host-to-human transmission) events that may trigger future outbreaks if left uncontained. Finally, we found that female and non-comorbid individuals were preferentially infected during the Spring 2014 outbreak, which may lend insight into the enabling conditions that are necessary for MERS outbreaks to emerge and propagate. Further exploration of the mechanisms that result in the zoonotic introduction of MERS-Coronavirus into the human population - as well as the emergence and propagation of MERS outbreaks - is crucial. As demonstrated by the steady stream of sporadic cases that have been reported since the Spring 2014 outbreak, MERS has already gained a firm foothold in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Given that Saudi Arabia is a universal religious travel destination, localized outbreaks may have massive global implications. Because of this, we conclude with the recommendation that the Saudi government should immediately prioritize systematic outbreak planning, preparedness, and prevention. Developing an early warning system (EWS) for MERS in Saudi Arabia using engineering systems modeling methods - namely, system dynamics - may help achieve these ends. If successfully within the context of MERS-Coronavirus in Saudi Arabia, such a modeling framework may also be generalized to other zoonotic pathogens with similar emergent properties and global ramifications.",2015,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia : insights from publicly available data,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PPRNYUYS,thesis,2010,"Ranjan, Manya; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Feasibility of air capture,,,,,,"Capturing CO2 from air, referred to as Air Capture, is being proposed as a viable climate change mitigation technology. The two major benefits of air capture, reported in literature, are that it allows us to reduce the atmospheric carbon concentration, the only technology to do so, and that it can tackle emissions from distributed sources. Technically, air capture is not a new technology; industrial applications can be traced back to the 1930s. This thesis explores the feasibility of this technology as a climate change mitigation option. Two different pathways of air capture are assessed in this dissertation, direct air capture, which uses a chemical process to capture CO2 and biomass coupled with carbon capture and sequestration, which utilizes the biological process of CO2 capture by biomass. The cost of direct air capture reported in literature is in the range of $100/tC and $500/tC ($27/tCO2 - $136/tCO2). A thermodynamic minimum work calculation performed in this thesis shows that just the energy cost of direct air capture would be in the range of $1540-$23 10/tC ($420-$630/tCO 2) or greater. To this, one must add the capital costs, which will be significant. This shows that the cost of this technology is probably prohibitive. The difficulty of air capture stems from the very low concentration of CO2 in air, about 400 ppm. A section in this work elaborates on the difficulties associated with designing such an absorption system for direct air capture. The pathway of biomass coupled with carbon capture and sequestration looks more promising from a cost perspective. This work puts its avoided cost in the range of $150/tCO 2 to $300/CO 2. However, the land requirement of this process is a concern. Sequestering I Gt of CO2 this way will require more than 200,000 square miles of land. In summary, direct air capture has a prohibitively high mitigation cost, which is not comparable to the other climate change mitigation options. Such high costs make relying on this technology for mitigating carbon emissions a poor policy decision. The pathway of biomass coupled with carbon capture and sequestration has reasonable costs and could be used to offset certain emissions. However, the large land requirement may limit the amount of offsets available. All in all, air capture should not be considered as a leading carbon mitigation option.",2010,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: Feasibility of air capture,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For nearly 60 years, semiconductor technology has been defined by rapid rates of progress and concomitant decreases in costs-perfunction made possible by the extendibility of the silicon integrated-circuit. The stability of this technological paradigm has not only driven the transformation of the global economy but also deeply shaped scholars’ understanding of technological change. This study addresses the nature of technological change at the end of a paradigm and examines the role and capability of different institutions in shaping directions and responding to challenges during this period. This study first provides theoretical and historical context for the phenomenon under consideration. In order to place the dynamics of an industry at the end of a technology paradigm into proper context, particular attention is given to the semiconductor industry’s history of failed proclamations of impending limits. The examination of previous episodes of technological uncertainty and the development of institutions to respond to those episodes is used to illustrate the industry’s departure from previous modes of technological and institutional evolution. The overall findings suggest that existing institutions may not be capable of addressing the semiconductor industry’s looming technological discontinuity. Despite the creation of an entirely new institution, the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative, specifically oriented toward the end of Moore’s Law the industry, government agencies, and the scientific community writ large have been unable to find a successor to the silicon CMOS transistor to date. At the terminus of this dissertation, research toward new computing technologies remains ongoing with considerable scientific, technological, and market uncertainty over future technology directions.",12/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Scaling Moore’s Wall,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721397.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PTX8NUHV,thesis,2015,"Stein, Beth R.",Applications of Imaging Spectroscopy in Forest Ecosystems at Multiple Scales,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1946183023?pq-origsite=primo,"Forests provide a number of ecosystem services which sustain and enrich the wildlife, human societies, and the environment. However, many disturbances threaten forest ecosystems, making it necessary to monitor their health for optimal management and conservation. Although there are many indicators of forest health, changes in biogeochemical cycling, loss of species diversity, and invasive plants are particularly useful due to their vulnerability to the effects of climate change and intensive agricultural land use. Thus, this work evaluates the use of imaging spectroscopy to monitor forest nutrient status, species diversity, and plant invasions in the Mid-Atlantic region. The research is divided into four separate studies, each of which evaluated a unique application for imaging spectroscopy data at a different scale within the forest. The first two studies examined loblolly pine nutrient status at the leaf and canopy scales, respectively. The first study determined that loblolly pine foliar macronutrient concentrations can be successfully modeled across the Southeastern US (R2=0.39-0.74). Following on these results, the second study focused on the relationship between physical characteristics, reflectance, and nutrients. Reflectance values and W scattering coefficients produced successful nitrogen models across loblolly pine plots at the canopy scale. Regression models showed similar explanatory power for nitrogen, although W scattering coefficients were significantly correlated with nitrogen at multiple wavelengths and reflectance variables were not. However, the direction of some of the correlations with W and the unusually high directional area scattering factor values indicate a need for further experimentation. The third study found that several imaging spectroscopy algorithms were moderately successful in identifying wavyleaf basketgrass invasions in mixed deciduous forests (overall accuracy=0.35-0.78; kappa=0.41-0.53). Lastly, the fourth study used a novel imaging spectroscopy/lidar fusion to identify canopy gaps and measure species diversity of understory vegetation. The lidar algorithm identified 29 of 34 canopy gaps, and regression models explained 49 percent of the variance in gap species diversity. In conclusion, imaging spectroscopy can be used to evaluate ecosystem health through forest nutrient status, nitrogen models, species diversity estimates, and identification of invasive plant species.",2015,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Applications of Imaging Spectroscopy in Forest Ecosystems at Multiple Scales ISBN: 9780355211146,,,,,Remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Causal Analysis based on STAMP (CAST) is compared with the Root Cause Analysis, a traditional chain of events based model, used by the original investigation team after the collision. Linear chain of event models like the Root Cause Analysis often look for a broken component or incorrect action within the proximal sequence of events leading to the accident. CAST examines a system's entire safety control structure to assess why the system constraints, control loops, and process models were either inadequate or flawed. This thesis aims at identifying how the safety control structure of the Offshore Supply Vessel operations could be improved by identifying the systemic factors and component interactions that contributed to the collision. The primary objective of this thesis is to demonstrate the use of a systems theory-based accident analysis technique in analyzing a complex accident. The secondary objective of this thesis is to compare and contrast the outcomes of the Root Cause Analysis conducted by the Navy Programs organization, with the findings of the CAST analysis.

PV45996Y,thesis,2015,"Perlman, Rachel Martha Katims; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program","Identifying sustainable organic management systems in urban India: case study of Pune, India",,,,,,"With increasing population and per-capita capita waste generation, cities in India and other developing countries are seeking alternative strategies to manage the organic fraction of municipal solid waste in an effort to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase environmental performance. This thesis aims to explore the tradeoffs of various organic waste management strategies in the urban Indian context, specifically using a case study analysis of the waste system in the city of Pune. Door-to-door, primary, and secondary collection and four technologies for treating organics (landfilling, composting, anaerobic digestion, and pelletization) are analyzed with regard to cost and environmental performance. Because decentralized waste system architectures minimize transportation and allows wastepickers to maintain jobs, particular emphasis is made in this thesis to understand the cost and environmental implications treatment at a range of scales. To determine the quantity and composition of waste, we conducted waste audits of MSW that was collected from 2,650 households during two different seasons. Per-capita MSW generation in Pune was found to be 134, 309, and 401 grams/day for the lower, middle, and upper income residents, respectively. Of these totals, 80%, 66%, and 69% of the MSW was biodegradable. Given that middle and upper income residents generate 2.3 to 3 times what lower income residents generate, India can expect to see a significant increase in waste volumes as its population becomes wealthier. By comparing the spatial footprints of the technologies at a range of scales, it was found that pelletization of organic MSW (although it is not a fully developed technology) has great potential to reduce the spatial footprint of organic waste management. Cost modeling is used to identify the drivers of cost for each process and to identify the leastcost options. The cost per ton of waste managed using anaerobic digestion, composting, and pelletization decreases significantly with larger scale of treatment. Alternative organics management technologies used at small scales (less than 0.5 TPD) are more expensive than landfilling; however, if a facility of at least 0.5 TPD is used, anaerobic digestion is less expensive than landfilling. Pelletization and composting become less expensive than landfilling at the scale of 5 TPD and 200 TPD, respectively. Although the average cost of centralized organic waste systems is lower, the difference in cost between the lowest-cost decentralized systems and lowest-cost centralized systems was relatively small. A review of the relevant literature is used to identify the global warming impacts of organic waste processing. The global warming potential (GWP) of anaerobic digestion, pelletization, composting, and landfilling is estimated to be -51, -42, 38, and 510 kg CO-eq/ton, respectively. A city looking to minimize its contribution to global warming could achieve significant reductions in emissions by biodigesting food waste and peltetizing yard waste. Such systems would have a net greenhouse gas emissions savings of over 750 tons CO2-eq each year. Of the technologies assessed, anaerobic digestion (at scales of 5 TPD or larger) has the best combination of cost and GWP performance. However, because woody material cannot be digested, pelletization (at 10 TPD plants) has the best combination of cost and GWP performance specifically for handling yard waste. These findings suggest that for handling organic MSW, anaerobic digestion in combination with pelletization produces the best combination of cost and GWP performance.",2015,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,Identifying sustainable organic management systems in urban India,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 S.M.,"Book Title: Identifying sustainable organic management systems in urban India : case study of Pune, India",,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A psychological perspective,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Why_do_we_want_to_defer_actions_on_climate_change_A_psychological_perspective/6724268/1,"A 2007 U.N. survey found that 54% of Americans advocate ―wait-and-see‖ behavior on policies that mitigate climate change, i.e., they infer that climate mitigation actions can be deferred until there are clear signs of danger. By evaluating different cognitive factors that influence human behavior, this thesis builds a framework that provides answers to an important question: why do people advocate wait-and-see behavior on climate change? One cognitive factor is misperceptions of feedback (i.e., ignorance of large feedback delays between CO2 emission decisions and the corresponding changes in CO2 concentration). Results reveal that the use of simulation tools, that provide repeated feedback about decision actions and corresponding consequences, is likely to enable people to overcome these misperceptions. A second factor is people‘s reliance on correlational or linear thinking (that the shape of CO2 emissions and CO2 concentration should look alike). Results reveal that the use of a physical representation (i.e., a picture of a problem in the form of a metaphor), simulation tools, and presenting problems such people‘s reliance on heuristics and biases enables them to make ecofriendly decisions is likely to enable people to overcome their correlational thinking. Other cognitive factors that affect people‘s wait-and-see behavior include people‘s risk and time preferences about future climate consequences when these consequences are either described or experienced. Results reveal that descriptive methods (e.g., books, newspapers, and reports) are likely to produce more wait-and-see behavior due to a high probability, small cost, and late timing of future consequences; whereas, experiential methods (e.g., movies, imagery, and games) are likely to produce more wait-and-see behavior due to a low probability, large cost, and early timing of future consequences. Policy implications suggest a careful design of descriptive and experiential climate risk communication methods, and the use of above described manipulations to improve people‘s decision making on climate change.",8/1/11,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,Why do we want to defer actions on climate change?,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6724268.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first study (Chapter 2), “On the Implications of Using Composite Vehicles in Choice Model Prediction,” I investigated the issues of choice set representation in choice modeling methodology. I derived composite correction factors for logit-class models that can help reconcile differences in modeling results in composite-level and elemental-level models. I then demonstrated cases where correction factors may be useful. This contributed to an improved understanding of how competitor representation affects choice predictions. In the second study (Chapter 3), “Implications of Competitor Representation on Optimal Engineering Design ,” I investigated profit-maximizing engineering design models that integrate choice models for demand. Specifically, I studied how competitor representation can affect the trade-off between cost and benefit of design change. I derived a closed-form expression for the marginal cost and benefit relationship for the level of an attribute under optimal design assuming a latent-class or mixed logit (random-coefficients logit) demand model. I used this to characterize the impact of competitor representation in a case study of optimal automotive design. In the third study (Chapter 4), “The dynamic costs and benefits of a technology-forcing policy nested in a broader performance standard: the case of ZEV and CAFE,” I addressed the complexity of dynamic effects and nested policy interaction in automotive energy and environmental policy. I focus on two policies: Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandates and Corporate Average Fuel Economy / Greenhouse Gas (CAFE/GHG) standards. I simulated consumer, producer, and government decisions in a model with explicit technological change, dynamic learning-by-doing spillover effects, policy interaction effects, and endogenous fleet standard setting via cost-benefit analysis. I demonstrated the potential impacts of ZEV mandates: potential net social benefit or net social cost, depending on key factors and parameters.

Q89UBA3J,thesis,2009,"Sasanuma, Katsunobu; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Operations Research Center",Policies for parking pricing derived from a queueing perspective,,,,,,"Drivers in urban neighborhoods who cruise streets, seeking inexpensive on-street parking create a significant fraction of measured traffic congestion. The solution to this problem is to reduce the total traffic volume including cruising traffic by implementing a congestion pricing scheme: the imposition of a usage fee on a limited-capacity resource during times of high demand. We review the history of two alternatives for implementing the scheme: road pricing, which involves cordoning off a section of the center city and imposing a fee on all vehicles that enter it; and parking pricing, which increases the costs of on-street and perhaps off-street parking. We find that parking pricing is often a needed companion to road pricing, since in many environments a significant fraction of drivers are simply cruising, looking for inexpensive on-street parking. However, the effectiveness of parking pricing is difficult to analyze quantitatively because vehicles cruising for parking are not clearly distinguishable from other vehicles. We view that the pool of drivers cruising at any time can be modeled as a queue, where 'queue service' is the act of parking in a recently vacated parking space and queue discipline is SIRO - Service In Random Order. We develop a queueing model of such driver behavior, allowing impatient drivers to abandon the queue and to settle for expensive off-street parking. We then relate the model to the economic theory of congestion pricing, arguing that price differentials between on-street and off-street parking should be reduced in order to reduce traffic congestion. Using the ""Parking Queue"" model and collected data, we estimate that less than half of cruising drivers successfully find a vacant spot and the number of cruising vehicles is 10-20% of the total number of parking spaces during peak hours in the most congested area in Boston.",2009,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2009 S.M.,Book Title: Policies for parking pricing derived from a queueing perspective,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Operations Research Center,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The emotional devastation of these events for women and families is compounded by socio-cultural beliefs and practices obscuring their existence in some societies and national health statistics. Community health workers engaged in pregnancy tracking and vital events documentation are in a position to capture these events if they are trained in correct event classification and supported in the data collection process. In Malawi, the Institute for International Programs supported community health workers, known as Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs), in the monthly documentation of pregnancies, births, and deaths to estimate annual rates of under-five mortality. We implemented a data quality documentation training and data editor verification process to evaluate documentation of vital events, namely adverse pregnancy outcomes. We also implemented a cluster randomized mHealth intervention designed to improve Real-time Mortality Monitoring HSA documentation of pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes. We present the results of these two data quality evaluations in this dissertation. To evaluate the documentation of adverse pregnancy outcomes— induced abortions, miscarriages, stillbirths, and early neonatal deaths— we compared HSA reported adverse pregnancy outcomes against results from the data editor verification process. Classification of early pregnancy loss was poor in both districts, despite improving slightly in the post-training period. To evaluate the effectiveness of the mHealth intervention in improving documentation of pregnancy outcomes, we matched reported pregnancies with live births and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The mHealth interventions improved documentation of matched pregnancies in both treatment groups relative to the baseline period, yet improvements were not noted between groups during the intervention period. Until a fully functional civil registration and vital statistic system is implemented in Malawi, HSAs are a potential source of perinatal mortality data but need substantial support to meet high data quality standards. This level of support was not achieved through the data quality training or mHealth intervention. Further research should be conducted to identify the most effective trainings and mHealth applications to support community health worker documentation of pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes, with a strong focus on adverse pregnancy outcomes.",2016,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Evaluation of data quality improvement interventions focusing on pregnancy outcome and perinatal mortality documentation by health surveillance assistants in the Salima and Balaka districts of Malawi ISBN: 9781369475241,,,,,Public health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
QABIIDDU,thesis,2009,"Kuntze, Erin M.",Exotic dancers and the psychotherapeutic encounter,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/305067959?pq-origsite=primo,"This study reports on qualitative data collected through extensive interviews with ten women, currently living in San Francisco, who self-identified as past or present exotic dancers. All had worked as exotic dancers at various venues in multiple cities in the United States. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the way female exotic dancers experience, construct and understand their lives (i.e. identities, desires, conflicts, and behaviors) in relation to dancing. The secondary purpose of this research was to explore the ways that female exotic dancers experience mental health care. This study utilized a relational, qualitative, ""feminist voice-centered"" method of data analysis geared to study subjective lived experience (Brown & Gilligan, 1992). Unlike traditional research, the methodology used in this study called for consultation between coresearchers and the primary researcher to clarify information shared during the interview. Using the voice-centered relational method of analysis, themes emerged that provide special considerations for psychotherapists to take into account when working within this community of women. The primary finding was the pervasiveness of whore stigma within the internal and external worlds of coresearchers. The secondary finding was that stigma plays a fundamental role in the therapeutic process. Specifically, coresearchers described the ways that they construct their lives around the experience of stigma as they debate whether and when to disclose their work, develop a hypersensitivity about trust, and isolate from society and the people they love most; they do this to protect themselves from the sting of the experience of stigma, and find themselves isolated from their core self. Suggestions derived from the data are offered to enhance therapeutic effectiveness for this under-researched population.

The objective of this thesis is to determine the impact distributed energy resources have on power grids and markets. This research investigates, models, and quantifies the influence of DERs on prices of electricity, networks and environmental effects. There is an evolving role between distribution and transmission system operations. Quantitative modeling and a qualitative literature, industry and regulatory review were utilized to determine the impact that DERs have on market prices, grid operations and the environment of the future. Distributed energy resources will impact the electric grid: from market economics to grid operations and reliability to coordination, and regulations. Firstly, from the European Union to the United States, power systems across the world are transforming to include and integrate larger penetrations of decentralized resources, while maintaining or increasing efficiency and operational reliability. Secondly, distributed energy resources have a quantifiable impact on short-term wholesale pricing of electricity (LMPs). Thirdly, distribution locational marginal prices (DLMPs) have been approximated, using a direct current optimal power flow, and yield insight into the revenues, prices, emissions and other bulk power system impacts at the interface between real-world transmission and distribution electricity networks. Lastly, the impact and to whom, whether costly or beneficial, that distributed energy resources have in markets and society, depends on the location in which they are interconnected.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Impact of distributed energy resources on locational marginal prices and electricity networks,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deploying large amounts of renewable energy is a key aspect in transitioning to a low?carbon economy and limiting the negative effects of climate change. However, in addition to  technical and economic challenges, renewable energy deployment must satisfy environmental,  social, and regulatory interests. Given the breadth of disparate interests affecting deployment prospects, I develop models and frameworks that help quantify the costs and benefits of offshore  wind deployment, demonstrate how several interests can be balanced in plant design, and  operationalize qualitative factors to inform decision makers on the tradeoffs of deployment  strategies. The technological scope of these studies is on offshore wind renewable energy which  is a nascent energy source with a large—still untapped—technical potential, and energy  decarbonization potential.   First, I consider a novel way of deploying floating offshore wind turbines that reduces physical  obstructions and allows turbines to be built in less-contentious waters. I quantify one  environmental benefit and the cost of this strategy. I find that the strategy realizes a cost penalty  of at least 30 US dollars/megawatt-hour and eliminates up to 900 kilometers of mooring chains for  a 1-gigawatt array. While this added cost is substantial, there are further opportunities and  scenarios where this strategy can make sense. I then investigate plant technology and site  alternatives using a multi-criteria analysis framework to compare the suitability of alternatives  based on optimizing techno-economics and minimizing impacts. I find that the larger plants the  industry is pushing toward are fragile in terms of suitability of locations, while smaller plants are  more robust with respect to locations. I also find that there are large areas where the two  perspectives align that the industry should pursue. This suggests that an overly narrow view on techno-economics only can lead to uncertain project outcomes. Finally, I propose a way to  operationalize socio-political aspects and regulatory obligations of the adoption environment in  order to compare transmission strategies from offshore wind which may face differential  obligations. I find that shortening the development process by one year is equivalent to an  investment tax credit of 2.6% and may be worth more than 65 million euros for a single project. I  also find that there are very few scenarios where a novel and expensive transmission strategy is  more advantageous than the baseline technology, but it is critical to quantify the impact of more  expensive strategies that may ease regulatory obligations. The results suggest that further  improvements of the novel technology are needed to directly compete on a cost basis. In future  work, I plan to explore green hydrogen deployment that considers socio-political factors and a  market evolution element of the technology to understand how different adoption environments or  socio-political attitudes can affect levels of attainment of renewable energy capacity or overall  carbon abatement.",2024,5/20/25 15:59,5/20/25 15:59,5/20/25 15:59,6232291 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 6232291 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
QLJWKI4J,thesis,2024,"Han, Jessy Xinyi; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",A causal framework to evaluate racial bias in law enforcement systems,,,,,,"We are interested in developing a data-driven method to evaluate race-induced biases in law enforcement systems. While the recent works have addressed this question in the context of police-civilian interactions using police stop data, they have two key limitations. First, bias can only be properly quantified if true criminality is accounted for in addition to race, but it is absent in prior works. Second, law enforcement systems are multi-stage and hence it is important to isolate the true source of bias within the ""causal chain of interactions"" rather than simply focusing on the end outcome; this can help guide reforms. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting a multi-stage causal framework incorporating criminality. We provide a theoretical characterization and an associated datadriven method to evaluate (a) the presence of any form of racial bias, and (b) if so, the primary source of such a bias in terms of race and criminality. Our framework identifies three canonical scenarios with distinct characteristics: in settings like (1) airport security, the primary source of observed bias against a race is likely to be bias in law enforcement against innocents of that race; (2) AI-empowered policing, the primary source of observed bias against a race is likely to be bias in law enforcement against criminals of that race; and (3) police-civilian interaction, the primary source of observed bias against a race could be bias in law enforcement against that race or bias from the general public in reporting (e.g. via 911 calls) against the other race. Through an extensive empirical study using police-civilian interaction (stop) data and 911 call data, we find an instance of such a counter-intuitive phenomenon: in New Orleans, the observed bias is against the majority race and the likely reason for it is the over-reporting (via 911 calls) of incidents involving the minority race by the general public.",2024,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: A causal framework to evaluate racial bias in law enforcement systems,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In bridging the two literatures, we find that the outcomes of wilderness education align well with the contemporary demands of engineering education. The initial implementation of the design-based wilderness education curriculum took place in the Summer of 2014. Thirty students from the Singapore University of Technology and Design and six students from MIT participated in the program. A mixed-methods study was performed, relying on surveys, exit interviews, and instructor observations. The findings from the research illustrate that design-based wilderness education holds the potential to serve as an exciting novel avenue to encourage design thinking, the development of an engineering science worldview, and leadership ability.

QMJ832AX,thesis,2018,"Williams, Adam D.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems","Beyond gates, guards and guns: the systems-theoretic framework for security at nuclear facilities",,,,,,"Current approaches to nuclear security can produce elegantly designed physical protection systems (PPS) that may be limited by untenable assumptions or well stated-albeit vague and imprecise-descriptions of how to improve nuclear security culture itself. According to one nuclear security culture expert: While the International Atomic Energy Agency has released methodologies on evaluating vulnerabilities and physical protection, it has not yet introduced guidelines on assessing the human-factor in detection, delay, and response. (Khripunov, 2014, pp. 39-40) (Emphasis added) This dissertation argues that such a link lies in understanding how organizational influences affect the completion of tasks required for PPS to meet expected nuclear security performance goals. In this dissertation, I propose the System-Theoretic Framework for Security (the STFS) for evaluating system-level interactions between PPS and human/organizational behaviors to describe overall security performance. Invoking key tenets of systems theory and organization science, the STFS uses the concept of ""security task completion"" to explain how the interactions between PPS and human/organizational behaviors result in security performance at nuclear facilities. Yet, empirical data is needed to explore the efficacy of this approach for incorporating organizational influences into security performance. As such, my research objectives were to: 1. Improve the understanding of how PPS and human/organizational behaviors interact to produce security performance at nuclear facilities, 2. Identify a manageable (but not exhaustive) set of organizational influences on this interaction, and 3. Develop a framework for assessing these interactions and organizational influences on security performance at nuclear facilities. I used a mixed methods research design to develop the STFS. My first study consisted of 18 narrative interviews across different areas of nuclear security expertise and my second study examined the case of the 2012 security incident at the Y-12 National Security Complex. These two studies provided evidence for the security task completion construct (as a new causal mechanism), behavioral performance requirements (assumptions on which the causal mechanism is based), a set of organizational influences and quality indicators related to nuclear security performance. While this framework does not address every aspect of achieving high security performance, the STFS offers a structured thought process and direction for further development regarding how technologies and organizations interact to affect individual behaviors that contribute to security at nuclear facilities.",2018,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,"Beyond gates, guards and guns",,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2018 Ph.D.,"Book Title: Beyond gates, guards and guns : the systems-theoretic framework for security at nuclear facilities",,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
QNL85WKZ,thesis,2011,"Kushwaha, Pooja S.",Development of Knowledge Management Model for a Management Institute,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2314269086?pq-origsite=primo,"As the world moves towards a “knowledge based economy”, knowledge is increasingly being considered as the main driver of this economy. The success of economies in the future shall be based on how companies or organizations acquire, use, and leverage knowledge effectively. However, most organizations tend to over-emphasize on systems and tools, rather than on the core component that is knowledge sharing within the organization. Knowledge management is vital in knowledge-based organizations such as universities, since the majority of the students are knowledge seekers. The principles of knowledge management (KM) are widely acknowledged and have been developed over the last 50 years, especially in such disciplines as management science, sociology, and construction. Whilst knowledge management (KM) is still an evolving practice, specific emphasis is now taking place on securing leverage through knowledgecontext, interpretation, transfer, and reflection. Knowledge-based economies are increasingly reliant upon their intellectual capital (IC) cognizant of: the Information Technology (IT) revolution; expanding information society; the increased importance of knowledge; and the congruence and emergence of innovation through the application of KM practices. However, little work in the remit of KM has been evidenced in the Educational Institutes the omission of which is the focus of this research. There is a paradigm shift in the teaching methodology and none of the management 4 institutes rely on talk and chalk method and are now using case methodology or presentations as their teaching tools. In today’s digital scenario faculty are more focused on learning rather than teaching and to encompass learning, faculty are more like a facilitator for the students. Knowledge management helped faculty to grow as a good teacher, researcher as well as facilitator and it is fruitful for students to gain multidisciplinary knowledge which help them in their better employability in the growing competition and fast moving digital world. Educational institutions play a key role in knowledge creation. The explicit knowledge that student’s gain is embedded in their minds and constitutes the storehouse of an individual’s intellectual capital. In order to utilize all the benefits of KM, there is an utter need to develop a strong fundamental model for KM which in common can be implemented in different management institutes with flexibility for minor changes as per the individual institute’s requirements. In an educational set up, effective knowledge management ensures that academics are able to realize and develop their potential to the fullest. The KM model should be such that it can integrate the entire management education with uniform goals of mutual growth and imparting best education to the generation next. In order to understand the subject in more than 100 referred articles from various journals; magazines and websites are used for literature review and all the insights from them are used for designing questionnaire. The questionnaire is validated from the panel of experts as per the proven guidelines and procedures. Relevant data was collected from 250 faculty members from different Management Institutes in Indore from a short period of time. Different proven analysis processes were carried on the data leading to 3 factors related to Knowledge management implementation. Finding is also validated using content and criteria validation tests. Finally proposed knowledge management model is developed for Management Institutions and implications are coined for academicians as well as industry professionals.This research must be an attempt to develop framework model of Knowledge Management which is not at all developed in educational institutions in India but there is die need for managing knowledge of knowledge workers.",2011,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Development of Knowledge Management Model for a Management Institute ISBN: 9781088387825,,,,,Information science; Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
QNZS5HX5,thesis,2019,"Schwetschenau, Sara",Fit-for-Purpose Water Quality Models to Improve Drinking Water System Decision-Making,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Fit-for-Purpose_Water_Quality_Models_to_Improve_Drinking_Water_System_Decision-Making/9735977/1,"water infrastructure is critical to human health, protecting customers from waterborne diseases and other contaminants. Systems are comprised of two parts: treatment and distribution. Water quality is excellent immediately after treatment; however, it changes with time in the distribution network. Post-treatment residual contaminants interact chemically and biologically within the distribution network causing consumed drinking water quality to vary spatially and temporally across the network. As a result, maintaining post-treatment water quality throughout the extensive piped distribution network in the face of many complex chemical and biological relationships is a challenge for water utilities. Drinking water treatment and distribution system challenges are exacerbated by changes in water demands, associated with changes in population and industry, and the age and long-term deferred maintenance of distribution systems.Regulatory and public health requirements for water systems change, and as a result these systems have to be modified, upgraded or expanded over time. Meeting the existing and future challenges of drinking water needs requires a significant amount of resources and may require utilities to consider a broader set of engineering alternatives. The requirement for significant financial investment and the need to meet multiple objectives (e.g., cost, water quality) creates complex decision problems that benefits from a systems-based approach.Effective analysis of system conditions and challenges requires models. The model selected needs to be “fit-for-purpose” and tailored specifically to the system, decision context, and decision-maker to be considered useful in the decision-making context. This work applies models to two different stages of decision-making: problem framing and planning. A framing model provides an initial analysis of the system or topic area (e.g., prevalence of lead in drinking water), this type of model assesses available datasets to identify relevant ones, and aids decision-makers in identifying the target engineering question to investigate in subsequent analyses. A planning model is designed to address a specific set of engineering questions (e.g., where to place treatment in an existing system) and evaluates a wide range of alternatives to identify a set of promising options to be considered further by decision-makers. In this work, first, an integrated simulation and optimization planning model is used to identify the location and capacity of treatment plants within an existing distribution network. Second, a statistical framing model is applied to evaluate the prevalence of lead release within drinking water systems.The research objectives of this work are as follows:1. Develop a new approach to integrate optimization and physicochemical simulation models to improve selection or prioritization of engineering infrastructure design options in drinking water systems;2. Develop a multi-objective framework to evaluate the role of regulatory limits and the tradeoffs between cost and public health in locating and sizing drinking water treatment infrastructure;3. Evaluate the spatial distribution and relationship among water-lead and non-water lead hazards and density of sensitive populations to identify regions most likely exposed to elevated lead levels; and4. Define the extents of the uncertainty associated with the Lead and Copper Rule compliance evaluation to inform lead in drinking water decision-making beyond regulatory assessment.",10/11/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:34,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/9735977.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
QP7UIJXC,thesis,2015,"Perlman, David; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Future vehicle types and characteristics: reducing fuel consumption through shifts in vehicle segments and operating characteristics,,,,,,"Light duty vehicles represent a notable target of regulation in the United States due to their environmental, safety, and economic externalities. Fuel economy regulation represents one of the more prominent attempts to limit the environmental externalities of passenger vehicles entering the U.S. fleet, but focus intently on technology improvements rather than encouraging the sale of more fuel-efficient vehicle segments. More precisely, the current fuel economy standards, which will be phased in between 2012 and 2025, reflect an approach that is explicitly intended to be neutral with regard to the size and types of vehicles sold, with the stringency of the standard scaled to vehicle footprint, or the area between the four wheels. In light of this size-neutral approach to fuel economy regulation, as well as a lack of precedent in the automotive literature, the author examined the extent to which shifts in demand for different light duty vehicle segments can impact fleet-wide LDV fuel demand. Shifts in the demand for LDV segments have occurred in recent decades, with the market share of conventional passenger cars decreasing from more than 80 percent in the early 1980s to just over half today, replaced largely by sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and crossover utility vehicles (CUVs). Though many factors influenced this transition away from conventional passenger cars, available literature suggests that misalignment between fuel economy policy and prevailing market conditions, combined with some protectionist tax policies for the domestic auto industry, were the main culprits. Moreover, a fleet model analysis suggests that the impact in terms of fleet-wide fuel consumption was not trivial, with vehicles sold between 1985 and 2010 consuming, over their entire useful life, over 100 billion gallons of petroleum more than if 1985 LDV market segments have prevailed over that period. This historical analysis provided motivation and justification for exploring the potential for shifts between segments in the LDV market to influence LDV petroleum demand over the next several decades, in order to illustrate the potential missed opportunities of implementing fuel economy regulations that do not encourage the sale of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicle segments. Using a spreadsheet-based accounting model of the vehicle fleet, the author's analysis suggests that plausible shifts in the market shares of different LDV segments could increase or decrease LDV petroleum demand by up to seven percent, relative to a reference case provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (which, in itself, suggests a modest decrease in the demand for SUVs and CUVs through 2040). The author also explored the potential of a more radical -yet still plausible - change to LDVs to impact fleet-wide fuel consumption over the next few decades. Automating passenger vehicle controls has long been imagined by futurists and tested in various forms by automotive manufacturers since the 1950s, but recent developments stemming from a series of competitions sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency between 2007 and 2011 suggest that increasingly automated vehicle features may soon become a production reality. Though intended primarily as a means of improving safety, automated vehicle systems have the potential to also decrease fuel consumption. Also using the fleet model, the author evaluated the potential of a highway-only partial automation system - akin to systems reportedly being introduced to the market by General Motors and Tesla, among others, within the next two years - to reduce fleetwide LDV fuel consumption. Results suggest that, depending on a wide range of variables, reductions in fleet-wide fuel consumption of up to two percent are possible by 2050 relative to the Energy Information Administration reference case. Though the results of the analysis explored in this thesis may seem modest, they are notable nonetheless. Most importantly, they represent reductions in fuel consumption that are possible to achieve in addition to those likely to be driven by current fuel economy regulations. Therefore, the changes to passenger vehicles explored in this thesis represent potential strategies for reducing LDV fuel consumption as manufacturers reach the limits of technological improvements to engines.",2015,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,Future vehicle types and characteristics,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Future vehicle types and characteristics : reducing fuel consumption through shifts in vehicle segments and operating characteristics,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The central focus of this study revolves around the analysis of repetitive behavior in various scenarios including shopping, social media use, and news sharing. The initial study investigates the influence of habits on the in-store shopping experience. By leveraging store closures as a disruptive event, we examine how these closures prompt individuals to alter their purchasing patterns. We propose that such disruptions encourage people to engage in more deliberate decision-making processes, leading them to explore alternatives that they might have previously overlooked due to established habits. Employing a difference-in-differences framework, we estimate the causal impact of habits on brand loyalty. Our findings reveal a significant role of habits, with households exhibiting stronger habits experiencing a temporary disruption in their shopping routines following store closures. Over time, these households appear to develop new habits in different stores, resulting in lasting changes in preferred brands. This suggests that the formation of shopping habits can lead to suboptimal consumer behavior. These insights have practical implications for businesses, including pricing strategies, advertising approaches, and product placement within stores. The second study introduces an innovative methodology for quantifying habitual behavior in the context of social media usage. Interactions with social media platforms often yield psychological rewards, fostering the development of habitual behaviors driven by cue-response associations. By leveraging entropy as an implicit measure of behavioral regularity, this study aims to uncover the intricate relationship between habit formation and digital routines. Through empirical analyses, we establish the validity of the entropy metric, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing distinct behavioral patterns beyond mere frequency. Our results highlight the nuanced connection between entropy and future app engagement, indicating a positive association for lower entropy values and a significant decline for excessively irregular patterns. These findings contribute to theoretical understanding of habitual behavior and offer practical insights for managing digital habits. Ultimately, this work advances our comprehension of how habits manifest in the digital realm and provides a robust tool for predicting long-term user behavior. he third study delves into the intricate interplay between individuals' beliefs and their ability to anticipate the persuasive impact of climate change news articles. The central aim is to determine whether climate change deniers or believers possess varying capacities to predict the persuasive consequences of articles emphasizing climate change severity. Through a series of surveys, we gather predictions about the impact of such articles on climate change deniers. Surprisingly, findings reveal discordant predictions: deniers anticipate a backfire effect among peers, climate believers foresee negligible effects. We rigorously test these predictions with a randomized survey experiment involving deniers, uncovering an unexpected positive opinion shift towards climate change after article exposure. Notably, this effect does not translate into discernible changes in stated or revealed support for climate change actions. In the context of the pressing climate challenge, our study offers insights to inform targeted communication and interventions that foster consensus and meaningful action.",2023,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,Habit formation and political persuasion,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Habit formation and political persuasion : a behavioral and statistical approach,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We start by recognizing that, independent of the industry organization, the uncertainties are enormous and often exogenous to the energy service providers. They are multi-dimensional and are result of fundamental drivers, ranging from the supply side, through the demand side, to the regulatory and policy sides. The basic contribution of this thesis comes from the recognition that long-term investments for ensuring reliable and stable electricity service critically depend on how these uncertainties are perceived, valued and managed by the different stakeholders within the complex industry organization such as the electric power industry. We explain several reasons why price signals obtained from current short-term electricity markets alone are not sufficient enough for long-term sustainable provision. Some enhancements are presented in the thesis to improve the short-term electricity market price signals to reflect the true cost of operation. New market mechanisms and instruments are needed to facilitate the stakeholders to better deal with long-term risks. The problems of ensuring long-term stable reliable service in the sense of the traditional resource adequacy requirements are revisited in both the restructuring industry and regulated industry. We introduce a so-called Stratum Electricity Market (SEM) design as the basic market mechanism for solving the problem of long-term reliable electricity service through a series of interactive multi-lateral market exchange platforms for risks communication, management and evaluations over various time horizons and by the different groups of stakeholders. In other words, our proposed SEM is a basic IT-enabled framework for the decision making processes by various parties over different time. Because of the uniqueness of electricity as a commodity, the values for the same amount of energy during different time and at different location can vary dramatically. Moreover, for the same hour, the values for the same amount of power at base load level or at peak load level are different due to the different generation technologies and other non-convex constraints like unit commitment. The multiple market products at zonal/nodal levels with different time horizon and time of use categories are designed to reflect more realistic demand and supply conditions at various temporal and spatial granularities. Detailed market rules, rights and regulations (3Rs) concerning the sub-markets interactions, product hierarchy and financial settlements are also examined.",5/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Stratum Electricity Markets,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723224.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Informed by a quantitative comparison of the numerical thresholds of reporting for gas grid and power generator failure events, I recommend a new reporting requirement for the gas grid that will bring it into line with the requirements for gas-fired power plant operators.In chapter 3, I examine why gas-fired power plants in the United States have failed because of fuel shortages. I analyze six years of data from a database of power plant failures called the Generating Availability Data System (GADS). Using pipeline scheduling data, I identify areas of the natural gas grid where enough pipeline space may be available so that increased priority fuel contacts could help mitigate fuel shortages at gas-fired power generators.Chapter 4 examines the economics of distributed fuel storage as a mitigation option for gas shortages at power plants in areas of the U.S. where pipeline space was not historically available. I estimate the additional costs required for New England gas-fired generators to install either distributed compressed natural gas (CNG) storage or oil dual fuel capabilities as fuel security measures at power plant sites. I construct fuel shortage mitigation supply curves using the cost estimates I develop. I also calculate simple payback periods of mitigation options using the cost estimates and foregone energy and capacity revenue stream estimates.

This thesis characterizes the supply chain challenges faced by the cell phone industry in Latin America. Key challenges characterizing emerging markets are highlighted. By using the case of a leading wireless network service provider in Ecuador, the document explores changes in the supply chain structure resulting from the evolution of its relationship with a supply chain solutions company, Brightstar. This evolution is represented by three different cell phone supply chains. The supply chains provide examples of responses to the supply chain challenges. The performances of the supply chains are compared based on the notion of responsiveness. To this end, system dynamics is used as a tool to analyze the different systems and the dynamics in action. Based on this analysis, recommendations are formulated regarding the current supply chain structure.",2010,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,Evolution of the mobile phone supply chain,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: Evolution of the mobile phone supply chain : the case of Ecuador,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, this thesis presents a new method to generate long periods of non-stationary wind speed time series data sampled at high rates by combining measured and simulated data. Paper 1 calculates the cost of curtailing the power output of a wind farm to provide a reserve of power to regulate the electrical grid frequency, as required by grid operators in several countries with high wind-power penetrations. The simulations in Paper 1 show that it is most efficient to curtail a few turbines deeply rather than curtail all turbines in a wind farm equally. Compared to regulation prices in the Texas (ERCOT) market in 2007-2009, a curtailed wind farm would be cost-competitive with conventional generators less than 1% of the time. Paper 2 supports the simulations in Paper 1 by developing a method to combine long periods of low-frequency wind speed data with realistic simulated high-frequency turbulence. The combined time series of wind speeds retains the non-stationary characteristics of wind speed, such as diurnal variations, the passing of weather fronts, and seasonal variations, but gives a much higher sampling rate. Papers 3 and 4 estimate the hurricane risks to current designs of offshore wind turbines in the U.S. Paper 3 develops analytical probability distributions based on historical hurricane records to predict the distribution of damages to a single wind farm in a given location. Paper 4 uses simulated hurricanes with realistic statistical properties to estimate the correlated risks to all the wind farms in a region and estimate the distribution of aggregate losses over different periods. Both papers find hurricane risks are small for current turbine designs in New England and the Mid-Atlantic, but the risks in the Gulf of Mexico and the Southeast are significant enough to warrant new, stronger designs. Hurricane risks could be reduced almost an order of magnitude by ensuring that turbines can continue yawing to track the wind direction even if grid power is lost.",5/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:23,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714854.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/ZSUXRW3K/Rose - 2013 - Assessing the Costs and Risks of Novel Wind Turbine Applications.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem we face is that vast numbers of white people do not see racial issues as something that needs their attention. President Obama's call for soul-searching and for conversations in families, churches, and workplaces requires that white people increase their capacity to talk about race. To engage large numbers of white people in a national conversation about race, more white people must decide to learn what being white means to them and how their white identity connects them to larger social systems. This basic interpretative study, using life history data, examines turning points in participants' lives that illuminate how they decided to learn about being white. Using purposeful sampling, I selected six white people who were recommended because they had been observed taking action to interrupt whiteness. The group is diverse in age, geography, gender, sexual orientation, and profession. During the first interview the participant created a visual representation of her or his life experiences and used that representation as a prompt for describing important markers in learning about whiteness. During the second interview we reflected together on the story I created from the first interview. Thematic analysis reveals five key elements in the participants' decision-making process: recognition that their conscious awareness of being white is integral to understanding racial issues, emerging sense of accountability, relationships with people who supported and advanced learning, role of emotions, and acquisition of new knowledge that deepens understanding of whiteness. Outcomes of the decision-making process are the desire to continue learning about personal white identity, to take action that interrupts systems of privilege, and to deepen understanding of how white identity is salient in today's world. I used the transformative learning literature as a theoretical lens for understanding the participants' decision-making and as a guide to the research methodology. The methodology of creative visual engagement with the participants' life histories suggests pedagogy for bringing to light deeply held beliefs and patterns of experience, which practitioners might use to facilitate white people's engagement in a decision to learn about being white.",2013,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,What's it like to be white?,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: What's it like to be white?: Understanding the decision to learn about being white ISBN: 9781303642746 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 4 Volume: 75,,,,,Decision making; Ethnic identity; Ethnicity; Geography; Presidents; Race; Sociology; White people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employing panel data, I analyze three issues related to the diffusion of ICTs in the scientific communities of less developed areas: 1) access; 2) interaction; 3) and involvement. More specifically, I examine the way in which human capital, family structure, travel experiences, contextual factors, and technological antecedents interact with gender to influence access to and use of personal computers, email, and the Web. From there, I incorporate technological behavioral changes to predict interaction within professional networks. In the last step, I incorporate professional network measures to examine the gendered nature of research outcomes in the form of scientific productivity.The results suggest that over time ICTs have rapidly diffused within the three locations. At the same time, women continue to report less long-term access to email and the web. Furthermore, men and women are distinctly different in terms of intensity and extent of email and web use with women emerging as less technologically oriented. In spite of the differences on these measures, men are not earlier adopters of the technologies than women. It does not appear, however, that there is a consistent relationship between greater email use and integration within professional networks. Gender, on the other hand, emerges as one of the most consistent predictors of network outcomes, particularly in terms of absolute network size, geographic and gender diversity, and the proportion of male contacts reported.Finally, men and women are equally productive in domestic venues, but women are less productive in foreign venues. Furthermore, network structure is not as strongly related to productivity as are changes in technological use behavior. Respondents using email for a wider variety of reasons over time produce more in foreign and domestic venues, but intensity of email use is actually negatively related to productivity, suggesting that it is not technology use in general that matters when predicting outcomes, but the type of technology use. Network structure on the other hand, is only a significant predictor of domestic productivity.",2009,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,Women and Science in Development,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Women and Science in Development: A Longitudinal Analysis of Gender, Networks, and Information Technology in Ghana, Kenya, and India ISBN: 9798802775530",,,,,Behavior; Communication; Developing countries; Digital divide; Economic development; Economics; Equality; Freedom of information; Globalization; Information technology; Internet access; Mass media; Occupations; Sex differences; Social change; Social networks; Sociology; System theory; Telecommunication; Women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R63MEFBR,thesis,2017,"Roca, Jaime Bonnín",Leaders and Followers: Challenges and Opportunities in the Adoption of Metal Additive Manufacturing Technologies,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Leaders_and_Followers_Challenges_and_Opportunities_in_the_Adoption_of_Metal_Additive_Manufacturing_Technologies/6720371/1,"Policymakers in the United States and elsewhere have recognized that a broad and competitive manufacturing sector is crucial to a robust economy and that to remain competitive, a nation must invent and master new ways of making things. Moving technologies from laboratory to commercial success poses considerable challenges however. If the technology is radically new, this transition can be so risky and investment-heavy that only very large private firms can attempt it. One such new technology is metal additive manufacturing (MAM). MAM provides a vivid illustration of the tensions policymakers must resolve in simultaneously supporting the commercialization of early-stage innovations of strategic national interest, while fulfilling the government’s duty to ensure human health and safety. After an initial chapter with a general overview of additive manufacturing technologies, this dissertation explores these tensions from the perspective of two very different industrial contexts: the U.S. as a technology leader and trailblazer in the development of the technology, and Portugal as a technology follower with severely constrained resources. In the first case study, I use the extreme case of MAM (an emerging technology with many sources of process uncertainty) in commercial aviation (an industry where lapses in safety can have catastrophic consequences) to unpack how the characteristics of a technology may influence the options for regulatory intervention. Although my work focuses on the U.S. and the Federal Aviation Administration’s regulation, I expect this work to have an international scope, given that in most countries regulation is heavily influenced by, if not an exact copy of, the U.S. regulation. Based on my findings, I propose an adaptive regulatory framework in which standards are periodically revised and in which different groups of companies are regulated differently as a function of their technological capabilities. I conclude by proposing a generalizable framework for regulating emerging process-based technologies in safety-critical industries in which the optimal regulatory configuration depends on the industry structure (number of firms), the performance and safety requirements, and the sources of technological uncertainty. In the second case study, I analyze the adoption of polymer (PAM) and metal (MAM) additive manufacturing technologies in the Portuguese molds industry, both of which offer important benefits to their products. Leveraging archival data (related to the history of Portuguese institutions, and the development of additive manufacturing both globally and in Portugal), insights from 45 interviews across academia, industry, and government; and 75 hours of participant observations, we develop insights about why institutional instability affected the adoption of Polymer Additive Manufacturing (PAM) and Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) differently. In both cases, Portugal invested in the technology relatively early, and in the case of PAM the research community has been able to move towards high-tech applications. In contrast, the adoption of MAM has been modest despite its potential to greatly improve the performance and competitiveness of metal molds. From the comparison between PAM and MAM, we generate theory about which technological and contextual factors affect their ‘technological forgiveness’, defined as the resiliency of a new technology’s adoption to institutional instability. We conclude by proposing a generalizable framework for ‘forgiveness’ in different industrial contexts. The final chapter of this dissertation contains practical recommendations for regulators and managers interested in adopting the technology. Policymakers in the aviation industry may want to encourage the creation of programs to gather more flight experience with MAM parts. Small aircraft and other applications with higher risk tolerance than commercial aviation might represent more important channels to gather information, as the history of composite materials suggests. More importantly, regulators may need to introduce clauses in their rules to regulate MAM to avoid situations of ‘regulatory lock-in’ which could harm the long-term potential of the technology. Despite the potential of additive manufacturing, we believe that near-term expectations for it are overblown. In general, additive manufacturing holds great promise, but in many areas the cart has gotten ahead of the horse. Much of the technology is still under development. The history of comparable technologies such as composite materials and high-performance castings shows that the problems may take decades to resolve. For now, additive manufacturing is cost-competitive only in niche applications — for instance, those involving plastics. Businesses that want to plunge into additive manufacturing should be cognizant of the challenges. Determining whether it makes sense to invest in additive manufacturing will require experimentation and learning.",12/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Leaders and Followers,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720371.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R6VL6PDI,thesis,2018,"Carless, Travis Seargeoh Emile","Framing a New Nuclear Renaissance Through Environmental Competitiveness, Community Characteristics, and Cost Mitigation Through Passive Safety",,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Framing_a_New_Nuclear_Renaissance_Through_Environmental_Competitiveness_Community_Characteristics_and_Cost_Mitigation_Through_Passive_Safety/6717320/1,"The nuclear power sector has a history of challenges with its relative competitiveness against other forms of electricity generation. The availability of low cost low natural gas, the Fukushima accident, and the cancellation of the AP1000 V.C. Summer project has caused a considerable role in ending the short lived “Nuclear Renaissance.” Historically, the nuclear industry has focused on direct cost reduction through construction, increasing installed capacity, and improving efficiencies to capacity factors in the 1990s and 2000s as ways to maintain competitiveness against other forms of energy generation. With renewables serving as an emerging low-carbon competitor, an added focus needs to be placed on indirect methods to increase the competitiveness of nuclear power. This thesis focuses on establishing pathways where nuclear power can be competitive with other forms of electricity generation given its advantages environmentally with Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), socioeconomically with legacy nuclear power plants, and through passive safety with SMRs. In Chapter 2, I estimate the life cycle GHG emissions and examine the cost of carbon abatement when nuclear is used to replace fossil fuels for the Westinghouse SMR (W-SMR) and AP1000. I created LCA models using past literature and Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the mean (and 90% confidence interval) life cycle GHG emissions of the W-SMR to be 7.4 g of CO2-eq/kwh (4.5 to 11.3 g of CO2-eq/kwh) and the AP1000 to be 7.6 g of CO2-eq/kwh (5.0 to 11.3 g of CO2-eq/kwh). Within the analysis I find that the estimated cost of carbon abatement with an AP1000 against coal and natural gas is $2/tonne of CO2-eq (-$13 to $26/tonne of CO2-eq) and $35/tonne of CO2-eq ($3 to $86/tonne of CO2-eq), respectively. In comparison, a W-SMR the cost of carbon abatement against coal and natural gas is $3/tonne of CO2- eq (-$15 to $28/tonne of CO2-eq) and $37/tonne of CO2-eq (-$1 to $90/tonne of CO2-eq), respectively. I conclude, with the exception of hydropower, the Westinghouse SMR design and the AP1000 have a smaller footprint than all other generation technologies including renewables. Assigning a cost to carbon for natural gas plant or implementing zero-emission incentives can improve the economic competitiveness of nuclear power through environmental competitiveness. The retirement of small and medium-scale coal power plants due the availability of natural gas can provide an opportunity for SMRs to replace that missing capacity. This trade-off between higher costs but lower GHG emissions demonstrates that depending on the value placed on carbon, SMR technology could be economically competitive with fossil fuel technologies Following my environmental competitiveness analysis, I shift towards investigating socioeconomic competitiveness of legacy large scale nuclear power plants compared to baseload coal and natural gas plants. In Chapter 3, I utilize ANOVA models, Tukey’s, and t-tests to explore the socioeconomic characteristics and disparities that exist within counties and communities that contain baseload power plants. My results indicate, relative to the home counties of nuclear plants, communities closer to nuclear plants have higher home values and incomes than those further away. Conversely, communities near coal and natural gas have incomes and home values that increase with distance from the plant. Communities near coal plants are typically either in less wealthy parts of the county or have a similar socioeconomic makeup as county. It can be suggested that equity issues regarding the community characteristics could be included in the discussion of converting existing power plants to use other fuel sources. Communities near power plants are not created equally and have different needs. While communities near nuclear power plants may benefit from the added tax base and absence of emissions, this is not the case for communities near coal and natural gas. With the impending retirement of large scale coal plants, the conversion of these plants to natural gas or small modular reactors presents an opportunity where negative environmental externalities can be reduced while also retaining some of the economic benefits. In Chapter 4, I present a model for estimating environmental dose exposure in a post-accident scenario to support scalable emergency planning zones (EPZs). The model includes calculating radionuclide inventory; estimating the impact decontamination factors from the AP1000, NUREG-6189, and EPRI’s Experimental Verification of Post-Accident iPWR Aerosol Behavior test will have on radioactivity within containment; and estimate dose exposure using atmospheric dispersion models. This work aims to compare historical decontamination factors with updated decontamination factors to outline the impact on containment radioactivity and dose exposure relative to the Environmental Protection Agency’s Protective Action Guide (PAG) limits. On average, I have found the AP1000, Surry, and iPWR produces 139, 153, and 104 curies/ft3 75 minutes after a LOCA. The iPWR produces less radioactivity per volume in containment than the AP1000 and Surry 84% and 96% of the time, respectively. The AP1000 produces less radioactivity per volume than Surry 68% of the time. On average, the AP1000, Surry, and iPWR produces 84,000, 106,000, and 7,000 curies/MWth 75 minutes after a LOCA. The lower bound 5 rem PAG limit is never exceeded for and does not exceeds the 1 rem lower PAG limit for whole body exposure at the 5-mile EPZ using the mean value. Considering this analysis uses a simple worst case Gaussian Plume model for atmospheric dispersion, the findings can be used to in conjunction with the State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses (SOARCA) to provide accurate and realistic estimates for exposure. I believe this analysis can help to develop a regulatory basis for technology-neutral, risk-based approach to EPZs for iPWRs. Finally, in Chapter 5 I discuss historical challenges facing the nuclear industry, policy implications, and recommendations. These policy implications and recommendations serve as pathways to frame an new nuclear renaissance. I also recommend future work where I details opportunities for improvements to nuclear competitiveness. Ultimately, this thesis can help policy and decision makers that can improve competitiveness and minimize risk as it relates to the expansion of nuclear power sector.",5/1/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6717320.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A substantial literature on international talent flows documents how the supply of foreign students to U.S. schools has changed over time, and the causal implications thereof. However, scholars have primarily focused on understanding the flow of students to U.S. graduate education programs—PhD programs in particular—ignoring the largest group of international students in the United States: undergraduates. In this study, the author leverages data from the Institute of International Education (1997-2018), the Chinese Ministry of Education (1996-2018), and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (2005-2018) to determine the proportion of Chinese undergraduate students enrolled at U.S. HEIs. The author finds that while the proportion of Chinese undergraduate students enrolled at U.S. HEIs (all fields) rose from 2008 to 2017, the proportion of engineering students only rose until 2014, after which it stagnated. In contrast, the proportion of Chinese undergraduate students enrolled in U.S. social science programs increased over the entire period (2008-2017). The causal factors behind the 2008 increase in overall Chinese student enrollment in the U.S. are difficult to determine due to the simultaneous increased affordability of U.S. higher education (due to rising Chinese household incomes and appreciation of the Yuan) and loosening U.S. immigration policies (specifically a U.S. June 2005 extension of Chinese students’ visa validity from six months to one year). Further research is needed to understand why the proportion of Chinese undergraduates enrolled in U.S. engineering programs stagnated while the same proportion for social sciences has continued to rise. Explanations might include field-specific discrepancies with respect to job market access and salaries in China or that students in social sciences are disproportionately attracted to the open academic environment at U.S. HEIs.",10/1/21,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:43,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/16725427.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/VPTK9BSH/Feldgoise - 2021 - Who Trains the Future.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The explosion of data that is generated through modern marketplaces provides new opportunities to use data-driven tools to understand and optimize the marketplace operations. This dissertation studies various problems around the following two pillars of data-driven operations: optimization and econometrics. In the first module we focus on optimization, in which we consider dynamic resource allocation problems under zero adaptivity. Dynamic resource allocation problems are omnipresent in modern business operations. In the revenue management setting, there are unreplenishable resources to allocate to heterogeneous consumer demands, immediately and irrevocably upon their arrivals. In such settings, zero adaptivity refers to a policy whose actions are independent of the remaining resources. Traditional revenue management literature has mainly focused on fully adaptive policies; and there is a gap between the provable effectiveness of adaptive policies in theory, and the applicability of non-adaptive policies in practice. We show that under different models of demand uncertainty, carefully designed non-adaptive policies may provably perform almost as well as the best fully adaptive counterparts. In the second module we focus on econometrics, in which we consider experimental design problems. Experimental design is a widely adopted approach for firms to evaluate the effectiveness of their initiatives, by comparing the standard offering to a new initiative. Such a task is often challenging due to interference, both over time and across units. Traditional experimental design methods suffer from large variances of the estimators when accounting for interference; and practitioners have recognized that insufficient precision may lead to unreliable inference. We build the theoretical foundations to use optimization approach to maximize the precision when designing experiments. Finally, we conclude with discussions of the limitations of the models and methods we have considered. We also provide practical suggestions to applied researchers and data scientists.",2021,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,Data driven operations,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Data driven operations : from algorithm development to experimental design,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To overcome those challenge, healthcare organizations have employed many of the common Quality Improvement Methodologies (QIMs). Those methodologies and others have been some of the most effective tools for quality improvement in many other industries, including manufacturing and supply chain. However, it is unclear as to how QIMs are utilized in healthcare settings and if the QIM implementations can benefit from the commonly implemented Health Information Technologies (HITs). This study evaluates the hypothesis of whether or not QIMs are implemented using HIT systems in hospitals and practices in the United States. This involves evaluating the types of implemented QIMs as well as investigating the outcomes of the employed methodologies in terms of efficiency, throughput and financial impact. Moreover, the study forms an understanding on how the different HITs that exist in many healthcare settings are used as part of QIMs. The study also assesses the obstacles that prevent hospitals and practices from utilizing HITs in QIMs. To conduct the study, two datasets have been obtained, which are the Dorenfest Institute dataset and the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics data source.

RA525W2C,thesis,2019,"Mayfield, Erin",Cumulative Impact and Equity Objectives in Energy Systems Modeling and Policy,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Cumulative_Impact_and_Equity_Objectives_in_Energy_Systems_Modeling_and_Policy/7808555/1,"Energy system development is driven by the complexity inherent in physical systems and the influence of a myriad of diverse, interacting stakeholders with heterogeneous preferences. Transforming energy systems entails balancing multiple and often conflicting societal objectives. This thesis presents new modeling approaches for energy systems planning and policy evaluation, with an emphasis on cumulative impacts, equity, and system heterogeneity. The application domain of this thesis is the U.S. natural gas system, although the analytical approaches and insight of this research are intended to extend to the broader domestic and global energy system.Chapter 2 adopts a traditional economic efficiency optimization approach, coupled with methane emissions and abatement cost simulations reflecting system heterogeneity, to evaluate and design system-wide and super emitter policies related to methane abatement in the U.S. transmission and storage system. We find that most emissions, given the existing suite of technologies, have the potential to be abated. We also demonstrate that there are high societal benefits from abatement policies, and minimal (if any) private costs under standard and tax instruments. Superemitter policies, which target the highest emitting facilities, may reduce the private cost burden and achieve high emission reductions, especially if emissions across facilities are highly skewed. However, detection across all facilities is necessary regardless of the policy option, and there are nontrivial societal benefits resulting from abatement of relatively low-emitting sources. Chapters 3 aims to develop and demonstrate a data-driven approach for characterizing systems-level cumulative impacts of current energy systems. Specifically, we comprehensively assess the spatially-and temporally-resolved air, climate, and employment impacts from extraction to end use and over the life of natural gas plays in the Appalachian basin from 2004 to 2016. Our approach highlights the attribution of impacts across the supply chain, the tradeoffs between near- and long-term impacts, and the evolution and accumulation of impacts over time with changing regulation, natural gas activity, and technological and operational efficiencies and practices. We show that short-lived air quality and employment impacts track with the boom-and-bust cycle, while climate impacts persist for generations well beyond the period of natural gas activity. We also find that employment effects are spatially concentrated in rural areas with thin labor markets where development is occurring, and more than half of cumulative premature mortality is within source emissions states. We show that most premature mortality is associated with end uses, while upstream and midstream segments also account for a substantial portion of impacts. With respect to climatechange impacts, the magnitude of methane emissions across the supply chain produces temperature impacts nearly equivalent to that of carbon dioxide over a 30-year time horizon, but over longer integration periods, the warming impact from carbon dioxide dominates. We estimate a tax on production of $2 per thousand cubic foot (+172%/-76%) would compensate for cumulative climate and air quality externalities across the supply chain.In Chapter 4, we develop a multiobjective optimization model incorporating cumulative impact objectives to facilitate future energy system planning. We develop natural gas system pathways by optimizing impacts with respect to sequential natural gas decisions regarding the timing and location of infrastructure and activity from extraction to end use. Environmental and employment objectives are conflicting if we follow a natural gas pathway consistent with the status quo; however, a collection siting, emissions abatement, and renewable integration policies may collectively resolve and reverse these conflicts.In Chapter 5, we develop and demonstrate an approach for evaluating the equity state of an energy system. We apply variants of standard methods and present new methods and metrics to quantify spatial, temporal, and distributional equity, leveraging impact estimates of the shale gas boom in the Appalachian basin from Chapter 3. We find that there are high temporal and spatial inequities with respect to cumulative air and employment impacts, and that spatial inequities are constant over time reflecting largely fixed infrastructure and consumption patterns. We also present indicators of temporal climate inequities, estimating that long-term global temperature impacts are 100 times that of near-term impacts. With respect to distributional equity of air quality impacts, we do not observe a disparity in mortality rates across sub-populations on the basis of income and poverty; however, there is a trend of increasing income corresponding to decreasing damages, which demonstrates the higher health burden of lower income communities. With respect to distributional equity of labor markets, we find statistically significant declines in the income disparity and poverty rates in producing counties. Pairwise comparisons of impacts reveal that changes in air and climate impacts are sensitive to changes in employment impacts.In Chapter 6, we develop future natural gas system pathways that optimize for the multiple dimensions of equity. We expand upon the multiobjective optimization model developed in Chapter 4, deriving objectives that instill different normative concepts of spatial, temporal, and distributional equity that apply to air, climate, and employment impacts. We find that there are inherent conflicts between different equity dimensions, as well as, between equity and cumulative impact objectives in a fossil-fuel dominated energy system. However, low-carbon technologies have the potential to reduce inequities.",3/6/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7808555.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Performance measure provides us with information about how good a system is working and how well the predefined goals are met. In order to analyze the performance of a transportation system, the traffic data such as speed, volume, occupancy and travel time of the system need to be collected. These data will generate valuable historical database that can be used to develop models to improve the quality of service of transportation system. The performance measures in transportation studies can be categorized to following main groups: Congestion, Mobility, Accessibility, Reliability, Safety and Environmental. Traffic congestion is one the important issues in any transportation system. Growing congestion in urban transportation network has enforced significant economic burdens to our current society. It causes waste of time, money, fuel and energy for the commuters and consequently impacting daily life of people in the society. Based on 2011 Congested Corridors Report presented by Texas A& M Transportation Institute, traffic congestion incurred $121 billion cost for drivers. Based on this report, 5.5 billion additional hours are wasted waiting in traffic in 2011. It means $818 additional fuel and time cost for each commuter. Being aware of the status of congestion in future can help, decision makers, intelligent systems and apps improve their accuracy and help commuters in their travel routing. To achieve these goals accurate traffic status classification techniques is required. Achieving higher accuracy is still one of the influential driving factor for research in this area. The objective of this thesis is to utilize data mining techniques to classify traffic status to congested or non-congested for some point of time in future based on historical traffic parameters (Vehicle Count, Occupancy, Speed). Moreover, to compare the performance of different data mining techniques on this problem. This dissertation examined several classification techniques including J48 Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector machine, PART and K-Nearest Neighborhood to classify future traffic status to Congested or Non-congested. The one minute traffic data from I-15 Northbound from I-215 up to Desert Inn, Las Vegas, NV were used to run these experiments. Based on the comparison of these algorithms, the J48 algorithm has the best performance.",2014,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,A comparative study,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: A comparative study: Utilizing data mining techniques to classify traffic congestion status ISBN: 9781321357967,,,,,Information technology; Transportation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RAWYX6ZS,thesis,2012,"Alonso, Francisco J.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Stakeholder value network analysis for the energy system of Saudi Arabia,,,,,,"Saudi Arabia is experiencing a considerable escalation in its consumption of electricity, provoked by economic progress and population increase. Such an escalation threatens the economic output of the Kingdom: more oil and gas are needed to produce electricity and thus less oil and gas available for international trade. Therefore, the Kingdom faces the challenge of looking to atomic and renewable energy as options to fill the electricity gap for the upcoming decades. In this thesis, One of the main challenges is that the energy sector is controlled by multiple stakeholders. We address such a challenge through Stakeholder Value Network Analysis. We provide a thorough characterization of the stakeholder network in terms of direct and indirect value exchange from the point of view of a focal organization: government. We quantify the value exchange in the network and provide a research grounded ranking of the most important stakeholders and the most important transactions of value throughout the network and directly linked to the Saudi government. Finally, we use such characterization and quantification of the stakeholder network to identify the mechanisms and tradeoffs that the government has to include regarding atomic and renewable energies in the production of electricity.",2012,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2012 S.M.,Book Title: Stakeholder value network analysis for the energy system of Saudi Arabia,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RBRY3N3T,thesis,2009,"Mahmoud, Hisham A.",Advanced transceiver algorithms for OFDM(A) systems,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/304996578?pq-origsite=primo,"With the increasing advancements in the digital technology, future wireless systems are promising to support higher data rates, higher mobile speeds, and wider coverage areas, among other features. While further technological developments allow systems to support higher computational complexity, lower power consumption, and employ larger memory units, other resources remain limited. One such resource, which is of great importance to wireless systems, is the available spectrum for radio communications. To be able to support high data rate wireless applications, there is a need for larger bandwidths in the spectrum. Since the spectrum cannot be expanded, studies have been concerned with fully utilizing the available spectrum. One approach to achieve this goal is to reuse the available spectrum through space, time, frequency, and code multiplexing techniques. Another approach is to optimize the transceiver design as to achieve the highest throughput over the used spectrum. From the physical layer perspective, there is a need for a highly flexible and efficient modulation technique to carry the communication signal. A multicarrier modulation technique known as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is one example of such a technique. OFDM has been used in a number of current wireless standards such as wireless fidelity (WiFi) and worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) standards by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and has been proposed for future 4G technologies such as the long term evolution (LTE) and LTE-advanced standards by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and the wireless world initiative new radio (WINNER) standard by the Information society technologies (IST). This is due to OFDM’s high spectral efficiency, resistance to narrow band interference, support for high data rates, adaptivity, and scalability. In this dissertation, OFDM and multiuser OFDM, also known as orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), techniques are investigated as a candidate for advanced wireless systems. Features and requirements of future applications are discussed in detail, and OFDM’s ability to satisfy these requirements is investigated. We identify a number of challenges that when addressed can improve the performance and throughput of OFDM-based systems. The challenges are investigated over three stages. In the first stage, minimizing, or avoiding, the interference between multiple OFDMA users as well as adjacent systems is addressed. An efficient algorithm for OFDMA uplink synchronization that maintains the orthogonality between multiple users is proposed. For adjacent channel interference, a new spectrum shaping method is proposed that can reduce the out-of-band radiation of OFDM signals. Both methods increase the utilization of available spectrum and reduce interference between different users. In the second stage, the goal is to maximize the system throughput for a given available bandwidth. The OFDM system performance is considered under practical channel conditions, and the corresponding bit error rate (BER) expressions are derived. Based on these results, the optimum pilot insertion rate is investigated. In addition, a new pilot pattern that improves the system ability to estimate and equalize various radio frequency (RF) impairments is proposed. In the last stage, acquiring reliable measurements regarding the received signal is addressed. Error vector magnitude (EVM) is a common performance metric that is being used in many of today’s standards and measurement devices. Inferring the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from EVM measurements has been investigated for either high SNR values or data-aided systems. We show that using current methods does not yield reliable estimates of the SNR under other conditions. Thus, we consider the relation between EVM and SNR for nondata-aided systems. We provide expressions that allow for accurate SNR estimation under various practical channel conditions.",2009,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Advanced transceiver algorithms for OFDM(A) systems ISBN: 9781109622034,,,,,Electrical engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RHBS9I5E,thesis,2020,"Klemun, Magdalena Maria; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Effects of hardware and soft features on the performance evolution of low-carbon technologies,,,,,,"This dissertation studies how physical and non-physical features of low-carbon technologies evolve and influence performance evolution. This fundamental question about the role of hardware- and non-hardware ('soft') innovations in technological progress remains largely unanswered despite the societal importance of improved technology. Multiple low-carbon technologies exhibit rising shares of soft costs, and understanding their determinants is thus critical to support climate mitigation. However, building this understanding is challenging. Technologies evolve through multi-faceted knowledge-generating processes, in which both endogenous factors, such as a technology's design, and exogenous factors, such as policies and research, play roles. To capture this complexity, a new conceptual and quantitative model of technology performance evolution is developed, where performance change (e.g., cost change) is the outcome of changes in physical and non-physical ('soft') features ('variables'), both of which can affect the performance of hardware and processes needed to deploy technologies. While physical variables -- material usage ratios, efficiencies -- describe the tangible aspects of technologies, soft variables (e.g., task durations, wages) characterize the performance of intangibles, including deployment processes and services. In contrast to physical variables, soft variables can change after the factory gate due to locational differences in technology management or labor costs. By defining hardware and soft performance as functions of both hardware and soft variables, and separating their contributions to cost change when multiple variables change, this framework disentangles the effects of physical and non-physical forms of improvement at multiple conceptual levels -- from changes in hardware or soft features, to the specific physical and non-physical innovations that drive these changes, to the higher-order improvement processes in which many innovations originate (e.g., research and development). This approach addresses shortcomings in current methods to analyze and track cost change in technologies, which often treat the performance of hardware (e.g., equipment costs) and of deployment processes (e.g., soft costs) separately. However, features of hardware not only affect the cost of equipment, but also the cost of deploying this equipment, and accounting for such interdependencies can change assessments of the sources of past and future technology improvement ...",2020,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2020 Ph.D.,Book Title: Effects of hardware and soft features on the performance evolution of low-carbon technologies,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first method, balancing area consolidation, addresses this cost rise by reducing the demand for ancillary services. This research quantifies the economic benefit of consolidation in the frequency regulation market by estimating the resulting reductions in frequency regulation requirements and cost. The results show that this policy leads to a reduction in frequency regulation cost of approximately $0.1 per MWh of total load. These results do not significantly change with the inclusion of 20% wind, suggesting that in the near term, wind’s interaction in the frequency regulation market is not a prime motivation for consolidation. This analysis does not consider all the benefits or costs of BA consolidation, and is not meant as an assessment of net-benefits. Though the results show consolidation could lead to an increase in emissions of some air pollutants, which suggest that there may be significant trade-offs associated with the decision to consolidate balancing areas. The second means of addressing the expected increase in ancillary services costs is to increase the supply of ancillary services by leveraging residential demand response. We developed methods that optimally schedule ancillary service capacity on demand response resources while accounting for the risk of customer response fatigue. The model is used to test the efficacy of hourly caps on demand response penetration in ancillary service markets. The results show that residential demand response could provide a significant portion of the total ancillary service requirements attributable to residential loads: between 50% and 75%. Hourly caps on demand response participation are shown to be economically inefficient. With a 25% market cap, residential demand response is scheduled to 6 provide 25% of the hourly total market value, while the risked-based optimization schedules residential demand response to provide 82% of the total value. Methods like the ones presented in this paper, that can appropriately weight the benefits and risks of committing residential demand response will be critical to efficiently and effectively use this resource for ancillary services.",4/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715058.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This heavily fossil fuel dependent generation mix contributes to approximately 30% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Energy efficiency (EE) and renewable energy (RE) are two ways to reduce the carbon footprint of our electricity sector. This dissertation addresses the decision-making behavior of actors in and across the commercial, residential and educational sectors on the adoption of EE and RE technologies in the U.S. This work characterizes the barriers and motivations to adoption as well as the associated health and environmental benefits from offsetting electricity generated by fossil fuel power plants.In Chapter 2, I employ an interview study to explore the behavioral and social factors in commercial building energy efficiency investment decision-making and to clarify the distinction between influences related to Economics/Technology and Psychology/Context. I find heterogeneity among interviewed experts and owners/managers regarding the value of corporate social responsibility (CSR). I also find that the relationship between owners/managers and their building engineering team heavily influences decision-making. Finally, the interviews reveal potentially promising new concepts related to psychological and social influences in the EE investment decision domain.Chapter 3 focuses on the residential sector and details findings from two studies evaluating the effect of a clean energy campaign on civic engagement (e.g. signing a petition) among parents already taking advocacy actions (i.e. advocacy sample) and those who aren’t (i.e. public sample). Among our public sample, I find that participants who believe the campaign to be credible and comprehendible are more likely to take action than those who discredit the campaign or do not understand its message. Additionally, I find parents who have children under the age of 18 negatively adjust their attitudes towards fossil fuels after being presented with health information.Finally, in Chapter 4, I focus on the educational sector and employ a benefit-cost analysis (BCA) to determine which states in the U.S. will benefit most from installing solar photovoltaic (PV) on their educational facilities and which PV projects are financially feasible. I find that solar PV in U.S. educational institutions can provide 100 TWh of electricity services annually, meeting 75% of these buildings current electricity consumption. The provision of electricity services from rooftop solar PV on educational institutions can reduce environmental, health and climate change damages by roughly $4 billion per year.Discussed in Chapter 5 are this work’s contribution to the literature and the policy implications regarding the adoption of EE and RE among various actors revealed in Chapters 2 through 4. For instance, findings from Chapter 2 suggest that policy makers should consider non-economic factors related to EE adoption, such as the relationship between owners and building engineers. In Chapter 3, I learn that campaigns can inspire civic engagement among residential consumers if campaign materials are perceived credible and advocacy actions seem effective. In Chapter 4, results detail which regions in the U.S. stand to benefit the most from installing PV on their educational buildings and provides a baseline analysis for efficient incentive design.",8/10/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:43,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7218389.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although user-centered design approaches remains useful for exploring how people cope with interactive systems, they cannot explain how this new breed of artifacts participates in people's sociality. User-centered design approach assumes that humans control interactive systems, disregarding the agency of smart artifacts. Based on Actor-Network Theory, this research recognizes that artifacts and humans share the capacity of influencing society and meshing with each other, constituting hybrid social actors. From that standpoint, the research offers a triadic structure of networked social interaction as a methodological basis to investigate how smart devices perceive their social setting and adaptively mediate people's interactions within activities. These triadic units of analysis account for the interactions within and between human-nonhuman collectives in the actor-network. The ""within interactions"" are those that hold together humans and smart artifacts inside a collective and put forward the collective's assembled meaning for other actors in the network. The ""between interactions"" are those that occur among collectives and characterize the dominant relational model of the actor-network. This triadic approach was modeled and used to analyze the interactions of participants in three empirical studies of social activities with communal goals, each mediated by a smart artifact that enacted--signified--a balanced distribution of obligations and privileges among subjects. Overall, the studies found that actor-networks exhibit a social viscosity that hinders people's interactions. This is because when people try to collectively accomplish goals, they offer resistance to one another. The studies also show that the intervention of smart artifacts can facilitate the achievement of cooperative and collaborative interaction between actors when the artifacts enact the dominant moral principles which prompt the ""preservation of social balance,"" enhance the network's ""information integrity,"" and are located at the ""focus of activity."" The articulation of Actor-Network Theory principles with interaction design methods opens up the traditional user-artifact dyad towards triadic collective enactments by embracing diverse kinds of participants and practices, thus facilitating the design of enhanced sociality.

Through a social constructivist worldview (Creswell, 2007) this case study uses a grounded multilevel mixed methods (Borner, et al., 2010) approach to determine social mechanisms of cross-disciplinary teams (CDTs) observing a National Institutes of Health-funded research network. Observations, interviews, focus groups and through the use of the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI) (Cameron and Quinn, 2006) data were collected and analyzed using qualitative coding to inform a micro/meso level of analysis between February 2010 and December 2011. Aim 1 sets out to determine social structuring mechanisms in CDTs. It searched for the dynamics that are at the core of team collaboration by focusing on descriptive elements found in team interactions on the individual, group, and network levels (Hedström & Swedberg, 1998). Aim 2 determines how social mechanisms emerge in a transdisciplinary team. As transdisciplinarity (TD) is an unlikely constant state in social systems, it may at times be a novel outcome of team science collaborations. At other times it may be dormant to lesser multi- and interdisciplinary functions embedded within group interactions (Klein, 2008). Through theoretical and emergent coding and graphical mapping of present and preferred change perceptions of those charged with crossing disciplinary and social boundaries the answer to how these mechanism emerge has been achieved. Findings show strong evidence of role and discipline perceptual differences that when analyzed separately provide differing insights into team functioning. When role and discipline were considered simultaneously, certain value-latent characteristics emerged as part of individual's self-perception of one's contribution to team functioning. Four main social mechanisms were identified: change, kinship, tension, and heritage. These contain identifiable team dynamics that serve as core evidence for specific team dynamics that support CDTs. This micro/meso analysis suggests that individual participation in team interactions can inform the structuration of individual role and disciplinary perceptions of macro level problems.",2012,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,Social Mechanisms of Team Science,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Social Mechanisms of Team Science: A Descriptive Case Study Using a Multilevel Systems Perspective Employing Reciprocating Structuration Theory ISBN: 9781267258205 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 7 Volume: 73,,,,,Boundaries; Cooperation; Kinship; Medical sciences; Participation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For nearly a decade, researchers have struggled with the question of how to model nanoparticles (NPs), an emerging class of environmental contaminants whose behavior in surface waters and sediments is controlled by complex interactions between particle properties and environmental factors. Population balance models, which track the size distribution of a particle population as it changes due to physicochemical processes, are a promising alternative to classical mass balance models that only track the total NP mass. However, the strengths and weaknesses of different population balance methods have not yet been explored in-depth for NPs. This work introduces three projects that, together, (1) probe the influence of spatiotemporal variation in environmental conditions on NP fate, (2) investigate the influence of common simplifying assumptions on model predictions, and (3) explore population balance for problems of NP dissolution and aggregation in water. Focus is placed on spherical metal and metal oxide NPs. Chapter 1 reviews past and current approaches in NP fate modeling, highlights key challenges, and frames the scope and objectives of this work. Chapter 2 presents a sediment diagenesis model that explores the influence of organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, and naturally-occurring sulfides on the distribution and speciation of antibacterial silver NPs and their reaction by-products in freshwater sediments. Chapter 3 presents a coupled hydrologic, agricultural, and water quality model that predicts silver and zinc oxide NP fate in a freshwater watershed under spatiotemporally variable environmental conditions. This basin-scale model reveals the unintended consequences of simplifying assumptions commonly used in largescale fate models of NPs. Chapter 4 compares alternative population balance modeling frameworks that vary with respect to runtimes, accuracy, and extensibility to environmentally relevant systems and complex particle types. Chapter 5 summarizes key findings and identifies high-priority research vii areas for experimentalists and modelers interested in the development of next-generation models with greater relevance for scientific investigations at the laboratory scale as well as risk management and regulation at the river or watershed scale.",5/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Modeling the Fate of Engineered Metal and Metal Oxide Nanoparticles in Surface W aters and Sediments,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720710.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the composition of faculty at public research universities is changing. Understanding the impact that these changes have on how public research universities function at both an organizational level and individual level is of critical importance if public research universities are to adapt and thrive. This dissertation focuses on the study of faculty roles and governance in public research universities. It considers the impact of both fiscal pressures and stress caused by the external environment as well as the influence of internal and external stakeholders on how public research universities are adapting institutionally--from a governance perspective, and individually--from a role perspective. It considers the structures, processes, and role demands that impact academic governance utilizing organizational theory, higher education governance theory, and role theory. It considers the critical importance of the organizational context of the public research university vis-à-vis society focusing on key aspects of the university as an organization and the importance of dimensionality of role. Six hypotheses will be tested using two data sets. Data from the Integrated Post- Secondary Education Data System (IPEDS) of the National Center for Education Statistics for the period between 1987 and 2007 will be utilized to identify trends regarding faculty hiring (tenure system, non-tenure system, and part-time). A second data set from the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) at UCLA's Cooperative Institutional Research Program for the period between 1989 and 2004 will be used to identify trends regarding faculty roles, stress, and satisfaction. Based on the empirical findings, a discussion of the implications for public research universities related to these changes will follow, including evolving structures, processes, and roles in governance. Future research will be proposed that is aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of the relationship between the role of the institution in society and the role of the individual within public research universities.

RNX8UEX4,thesis,2012,"Hagerty, John Michael; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",The role of hydroelectric generation in electric power systems with large scale wind generation,,,,,,"An increasing awareness of the operational challenges created by intermittent generation of electricity from policy-mandated renewable resources, such as wind and solar, has led to increased scrutiny of the public policies that promote their growth and the regulatory system that maintains operation of a reliable and economically efficient power system. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that hydroelectric generation can provide significant benefits in power systems that have already significantly increased their power generation from intermittent renewable resources. A heuristic-based algorithm for optimizing the scheduling of hydroelectric power generation facilities was developed and integrated into the Low-Emissions Electricity Market Analysis (LEEMA) model to analyze the interaction of generation capacity from wind, thermal, and hydro resources in the economic dispatch of individual generation plants. The algorithm identifies the most costly periods of thermal production, considering fuel, startup and operation and maintenance costs, to determine the optimal schedule of hydro generation within its capacity constraints. The hydrothermal LEEMA model is run on the current Spanish electric power system to identify the impact of introducing hydro generation to a system, varying levels of flexibility in hydro generation, and increasing levels of wind generation. The analysis concludes that hydro generation can significantly reduce the impact of intermittent renewable generation, that the level of flexibility of hydro generation must be understood to determine how beneficial the hydro generation can be, and that hydro generation will delay the most significant impacts of increasing levels of wind generation.",2012,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2012 S.M.,Book Title: The role of hydroelectric generation in electric power systems with large scale wind generation,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This information may pose privacy and security risks to the smartphone user. The risks may vary from government surveillance to theft of financial information. Previous work in the area of smartphone privacy and security has both identified specific security flaws and examined users’ expectations and behaviors. However, there has not been a broad examination of the smartphone ecosystem to determine the risks to users from smartphone data sharing and the possible mitigations. Two of the five studies in this work examine the smartphone data sharing ecosystem to identify risks and mitigations. The first study uses multi-stakeholder expert interviews to identify risks to users and the mitigations. A second study examines app developers in order to quantify the risky behaviors and identify opportunities to improve security and privacy. In the remaining three of five studies discussed in this work, we examine one specific risk mitigation that has been popular with policy-makers: privacy notices for consumers. If done well, privacy notices should inform smartphone users about the risks and allow them to make informed decisions about data collection. Unfortunately, previous research has found that existing privacy notices do not help smartphone users, as they are neither noticed nor understood. Through user studies, we evaluate options to improve notices. We identify opportunities to capture the attention of users and improve understanding by examining the timing and content of notices. Overall, this work attempts to inform public policy around smartphone privacy and security. We find novel opportunities to mitigate risks by understanding app developers’ work and behaviors. Also, recognizing the current focus on privacy notices, we attempt to frame the debate by examining how users’ attention to and comprehension of notices can be improved through content and timing.",9/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Mitigating the Risks of Smartphone Data Sharing,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720635.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recall of the prescription drug Vioxx (Rofecoxib) was used as a test case to study whether STAMP (Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Processes) could be used to outline the interactions between the different pharmaceutical system components, identify the safety control structure in place and understand how this control structure failed to prevent the marketing of an unsafe drug which killed an estimated 27,000 people in the United States. To supplement this static analysis, System Dynamics models were used to analyze the social and organizational dynamics that underline the US healthcare system and to understand how the system moved from a safe to an unsafe state which allowed a dangerous drug to be left on the market for over five years. The recall of Vioxx was followed by a number of legislative changes, in particular the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act of 2007. Those changes were mapped on the safety control structure and again System Dynamics models were used to understand the systemic implications of the policy changes. The models suggested that further changes might be necessary to protect the American public and so, based on the results of the STAMP analysis, a new set of systemic recommendations was proposed.",2010,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: A case study of Vioxx using STAMP,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RT92TMFK,thesis,2014,"Craig, Michael T.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Reducing the contribution of the power sector to ground-level ozone pollution: an assessment of time-differentiated pricing of nitrogen oxide emissions,,,,,,"Nitrogen oxide (NOx) is a prevalent air pollutant across the United States and a requisite precursor for tropospheric (ground-level) ozone formation. Both pollutants significantly impact human health and welfare, so National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have been established for each. As of 2013, over 100 million people in the U.S. lived in areas with ozone concentrations above the NAAQS. NOx emissions from the power sector, roughly 12% of total NOx emissions, are and will be significant contributors to ozone concentrations in the U.S. As such, states have reduced peak ozone concentrations through technology-based standards and cap-and-trade programs on NOx emissions from the power sector. These policies have largely treated NOx emissions uniformly. But marginal damages from NOx emissions are greatest on hot sunny days when meteorological conditions favor high ozone formation rates and, consequently, peak ozone concentrations. This thesis informs what type of policy is the most efficient for reducing peak ozone concentrations on high ozone days by assessing the cost-effectiveness of three policies for reducing NOx emissions on high ozone days. Emissions and costs under a relatively-novel differentiated policy, time-differentiated pricing, are compared for the first time to two currently-implemented undifferentiated policies, cap-and-trade and technology-based standards. Two power systems are studied, Texas and the Mid-Atlantic. A unique two-phase model is developed to capture the short- (re-dispatching) and long-term (control technology installation) effects of pricing schemes on power plants. The two-phase model dispatches generators with a unit commitment model, which, unlike past studies, captures real-world operational constraints of generators that may strongly influence emissions and costs under time-differentiated pricing. Technology-based standards are simulated via Monte Carlo analysis to capture the uncertain rule-making process. For reducing NOx emissions on high ozone days in both power systems, time-differentiated pricing is shown to be the most cost-effective policy with regards to producer and consumer costs. Most emissions reductions are due to substitution of gas- for coal-fired generators, as control technology installations are only observed at very high time-differentiated prices. For reducing summer-wide NOx emissions, undifferentiated pricing is the most cost-effective. In a minority of allocations, technology-based standards also achieve more cost-effective summer-wide reductions than time-differentiated pricing, but such allocations cannot be guaranteed ex ante. These results suggest that time-differentiated pricing is the most efficient policy for reducing peak ozone concentrations, depending on ozone formation rates.",2014,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Reducing the contribution of the power sector to ground-level ozone pollution,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Reducing the contribution of the power sector to ground-level ozone pollution : an assessment of time-differentiated pricing of nitrogen oxide emissions,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RUBI2JCX,thesis,2023,"Shi, Kai; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Local official and polluter accountability in China's environmental inspections,,,,,,"Poor environmental practices can lead to high levels of ambient air pollution that are detrimental to human health and cause premature death. Even if environmental regulations are well designed, incomplete implementation at the local level imposes substantial significant social costs. Although widely documented, solutions to inadequate enforcement have not been comprehensively studied. Using the context of China's environmental inspections, I examine which interventions effectively reduce air pollution in Chinese cities and close the enforcement gap. I am particularly interested in interventions that aim to alter the behavior of polluting company managers and local environmental bureaucrats. ""In this thesis, I evaluate China's ""new"" hybrid approach, environmental inspections, that combines top-down scrutiny with bottom-up reporting. First, I investigate the dynamic responses of polluters to central scrutiny, which is a sharp, temporary increase in regulatory enforcement. Using data from China that links the intensity of environmental policing to high-frequency air pollution data, I show that crackdown over short (one-month) periods results in a sharp (35-39%) reduction in weekly average pollution around coal power plants. Pollution gradually reverts to prior levels after crackdowns end. The pace of reversion is faster for firms that outrank the city government, suggesting that hierarchical ties to China's central authorities limit a firm's accountability to the local environmental protection bureau."" Second, I present a full account of the citizen complaints received during the environmental inspection and evaluate the incremental effectiveness of the complaint channel on plant's environmental performance. I build a novel data set that includes all complaint entries filed by citizens. I describe the frequency of complaints received by a wide range of polluters during the campaign, from small barbecue stalls to large aluminum smelters, suggesting that citizens focus on the most salient pollution sources in their immediate surroundings. Engaging citizen informants during crackdowns is not associated with larger pollution reductions but has no lasting effect, especially for the outranking firms. I further explore the effectiveness of such approach in a repeated version as the same program is conducted nationwide two years after the initial round. I find diminishing effects of top-down scrutiny as plants learn and update their beliefs on the seriousness of the campaign. However, direct central attention to these outranking firms during the lookback round may prolong the environmental inspection effect. Third, I ask what drives citizen engagement in a central-initiated monitoring program in an authoritarian regime. I identify city and plant characteristics that predict the number of per capita complaints. Cities with poor environmental performance at the outset receive a greater number of complaints during both rounds of the environmental inspection. However, citizens can not identify and report egregious plants that polluted more in the baseline period. In addition, the willingness of citizens to file complaints is contingent on the environmental effectiveness of the original round. At the city level, the number of air-related complaints received per capita during the lookback round will decrease if measured air pollutants return to their baseline pollution levels following the conclusion of the original round. This dissertation empirically documents the limits of China's highly centralized, state-led approach to improving environmental governance through enforcement crack-downs and engaging citizen complaints.",2023,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Local official and polluter accountability in China's environmental inspections,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis models two leading post-combustion CO2 capture technologies, a chilled ammonia-based CO2 capture process and an advanced amine-based CO2 capture process, and presents performance and cost estimates of these systems on pulverized coal and natural gas combined cycle power plants. The process modeling software package Aspen Plus® was used to develop performance and cost estimates for the chilled ammonia-based CO2 capture technology and general response surface equations were created for the model. Assumptions about plant financing and utilization, as well as uncertainties in cooling costs and chemical reaction rates that affect absorber cost were found to produce a wide range of cost estimates for ammonia-based CO2 capture systems. With uncertainties included, costs for a supercritical power plant with ammonia-based CO2 capture ranged from $80/MWh to $160/MWh, with the 95% confidence interval ranging from $95/MWh to $143/MWh (with all costs in constant 2007 US dollars). For the advanced amine-based CO2 capture technology, an existing amine-based response surface model developed using Protreat® simulations was modified to match the performance and cost characteristics of a modern amine-based system. The response surface models of both technologies were incorporated into the Integrated Environmental Control Model for use in developing performance and cost estimates of pulverized coal and natural gas combined cycle power plants with these technologies. The baseline costs for a supercritical power plant with advanced amine-based CO2 capture was $105/MWh and for the natural gas combined cycle power plant with advanced amine-based CO2 capture was $85/MWh. Both post-combustion CO2 capture technologies are then compared in terms of performance and cost for different ranges of fuel type, fuel cost, plant size, and CO2 capture system train size. A probabilistic cost difference analysis is also used to compare these technologies. The aminebased CO2 capture system is found to have a higher revenue requirement in all the case studies and only a 2% chance of having a lower revenue requirement than the advanced amine system in the probabilistic cost difference. Combined, these results suggest that the advanced amine system will have a cost advantage over the ammonia system in most cases, in the absence of significant new improvements in the ammonia system design. Finally, the importance of these estimates for policy makers is discussed.",5/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:23,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714605.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/JLTUMHF2/Versteeg - 2012 - Advanced Amine and Ammonia Systems for Greenhouse Gas Control at Fossil Fuel Power Plants.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RXYIE82V,thesis,2013,"Rohrbach, Amanda K.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Implementing technical transitions through schedule-based policy: insights from the Military's Airborne Tactical Network,,,,,,"Due to a need for congestion relief, as well as a projected increase in capacity constraints, the US Military's Airborne Tactical Network (ATN) is at the onset of a technical transition of their communication hardware and software. While the technical challenges appear to be addressed and agreed upon, the particular challenge lies in navigating the social and organizational challenges of decentralized control, stakeholder misalignment, network externalities, bureaucratic organizational procedures, and limited windows of opportunity. To alleviate these sources of resistance, this thesis proposes an incremental transition strategy that minimizes changes to operational procedures and distributes costs/benefits through schedule-based policy. This research developed a quantitative model to simulate a representative environment of aircraft maintenance routines, flight time, and network usage. Using this model, four incremental strategies were compared including regional, stakeholder-specific, platform-specific, and ""big bang"" approaches. By evaluating network performance improvements and representative cost profiles, this thesis contends that utilizing an incremental regional or stakeholder-specific strategy is a valid path forward for the ATN transformation. Additional research is necessary; however, to better understand the social dynamics between stakeholders and the relative magnitude of costs associated with each option. This thesis finally presents a 5th incremental strategy utilizing functional increments, which modifies the technical deployment of the systems by staging levels of upgrades sequentially over time. If this is technically viable, the results would distribute lower levels of costs over time and provide enough benefit to account for several years of anticipated growth in network demand.",2013,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Implementing technical transitions through schedule-based policy,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2013 S.M.,Book Title: Implementing technical transitions through schedule-based policy : insights from the Military's Airborne Tactical Network,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to a variety of factors, including technological progress and policy goals, many electric power industry stakeholders believe the business model of electric utilities is on the precipice of unprecedented change. However, calls for dramatic changes to utility business models must be backed by substantive analysis of what aspects of the business model must change, who is best suited to provide what services, and what resources should be deployed to provide these services. This thesis presents a review of current utility business models, an introduction to the agents driving changes in utility business models, and a methodology for assessing emerging business models that bridges two important but heretofore unlinked fields of business model analysis. This thesis first provides a definition of the electricity services upon which business models in the utility industry are based. These definitions are grounded in linear programming and fundamental power system economics and technology. Next, this thesis provides an ontological taxonomy of electricity services business models, and demonstrates the application of this taxonomy on demand response and solar photovoltaics business models. This ontological breakdown is extended from management and strategy literature developed over the past fifteen years in the context of emerging Internet-based businesses. This thesis then demonstrates how quantitative models can be used in combination with qualitative analyses to provide a more complete understanding of which, if any, emerging electricity services business models may prove technically and economically attractive.

S5C6DC7V,thesis,2009,"Campos, Norma Viviana; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program","Encouraging technology transition through value creation, capture and delivery strategies: the case of data link in the North Atlantic airspace",,,,,,"This thesis studies the problem of data link in the NAT under a technology transition framework of value creation, capture, and delivery. Creating value through a new technology, such as data link, refers to designing competitive value propositions for stakeholders. Capturing value means recovering an investment in a technology through the value it creates. Delivering value refers to developing policies and business strategies to enable value capture. Realization of these concepts is necessary to guarantee technology transition. Data was gathered from a survey of the two major stakeholder groups in the NAT, commercial operators and ANSPs. The survey covered five major research areas: 1) Perceived operational and coordination inefficiencies; 2) Opportunities to improve service; 3) Current and projected data link equipage and infrastructure in the NAT; 4) Value distribution of data link costs and benefits; and 5) Potential policy strategies to encourage data link adoption. The study found that data link creates value for stakeholders through an understanding of the evolution of technology and stakeholder needs. Fuel penalties associated with flying suboptimal flight levels and routes is the largest inefficiency in the NAT. Data link, particularly through the FANS system, is seen as the enabling technology to improve efficiency of operations. Reducing separation is the data link application most valued by stakeholders., (cont.) Coordination and harmonization issues threaten to limit the value created. Data link diffusion (airborne equipage and ground infrastructure) is not always guaranteed as a result of value created due to improvements in technical performance. Value capture is limited due to unbalances in the distribution of data link costs and benefits. So far, data link operational benefits have been significant but have not yet translated into economic benefits given that such applications have not been implemented in the NAT. Delivering value from data link is more than balancing costs and benefits. Uncertainty in a number of issues needs resolution before the value created through data link could be fully captured and delivered. A combination of operational, financial and regulatory schemes may be necessary to leverage costs and benefits and ensure successful data link value delivery to all stakeholders.",2009,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,"Encouraging technology transition through value creation, capture and delivery strategies",,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2009 S.M.,"Book Title: Encouraging technology transition through value creation, capture and delivery strategies : the case of data link in the North Atlantic airspace",,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S9JQDUL5,thesis,2009,"Anderson, Eric P.","Reformers revealed: American Indian progressives at Haskell Institute, Lawrence, Kansas, 1884-1909",,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/304905951?pq-origsite=primo,"Haskell Institute opened in 1884, an early example of federal off-reservation boarding schools for American Indian youth. The goal was assimilation: strip away traditional languages, spiritual beliefs, tribal customs, even family ties, and replace them with inculcation into the values of Western civilization upheld by white society. In reality, students, whose ages covered a wide range, often clung tenaciously to older, more familiar ideals. This study looks broadly at the effects of this conflict in the mindsets and behaviors of both students and administrators at the school (and similar institutions). Because Haskell’s first quarter-century overlaps with much of the period scholars call “The Progressive Era” in U.S. history, the time frame investigated yields rich data regarding new thinking about educational and social reform. While recent literature on the boarding school system has blossomed, the link between its activities and the larger picture of American Progressivism has not been firmly established within the context of a specific school. By the dawn of the nineteenth century, Haskell Institute was becoming the largest of these federal education outlets, making its success of especial consequence, both because it affected great numbers of students (and their support networks) and served as a model for promoting policy goals. Understanding how Haskell grew and became an increasingly accepted part of the American Indian experience requires the realization that native peoples played an active role in shaping the contours of their own education. While their “partnership” with government functionaries was often limited, the input they provided, through a variety of means, had measurable consequences for the direction and overall influence of the school. In this way, Haskell students (as well as their families, tribal leadership, and a growing vanguard of American Indian elites, themselves often the product of similar educational experiences) may be viewed through the lens of Progressive reform. Precisely defining Progressivism is difficult, but Indians’ active participation at Haskell did affect visible change in their education, and comprised another, overlooked example of Progressives in action. Through attendance records, administrative and curricular changes, personal letters and reminiscences, development of a more native-centered school newspaper, elimination (or tempering) of the most egregious aspects of boarding-school life, or other means, a tangible American Indian Progressivism emerges, with its ultimate aim retention of core elements of native cultures and traditions. Thus they were not simply victims of government or outside social engineering, but active participants in the education process. The intertwining of both federal directives and native hopes in the development of Haskell makes a fascinating case study of Progressive activism and reform, the ability to affect quiet change within an oppressive institutional atmosphere, the recognition of a strong native voice in this period, and the interdependence of the boarding-school system and American Indian peoples in establishing (often quite different) measures of “success” in this education. The survival of Native American peoples, customs, and Haskell itself, as a place today celebrating that persistence, is strong testimony to this Indian Progressivism and the works and lives of those who came before.",2009,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,Reformers revealed,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Reformers revealed: American Indian progressives at Haskell Institute, Lawrence, Kansas, 1884-1909 ISBN: 9781109640472 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 3 Pages: 1059 Volume: 71",,,,,Family; Indians of North America; Indians of South America; Reform; School boards; Schools; Students; Values,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SENC4EJC,thesis,2014,"McNamara, Julie H.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program","Bridging gaps in synthetic biology oversight: iGEM as a testbed for proactive, adaptive risk management",,,,,,"On the surface, the emerging field of synthetic biology looks highly similar to that of genetic engineering. However, the two fields are based upon divergent underlying logic structures. Whereas genetic engineering affects change through localized modifications of existing organisms, synthetic biology attempts to fuse independent component parts to create wholly novel applications. While legacy regulatory systems were adequate for monitoring biosafety in the early days of the emerging field, as synthetic biology advances, the fundamental differences in its logic structure are creating fissures in the oversight system. A continued reliance on increasingly incompatible mechanisms squanders the limited present opportunity for proactive risk management, and generates increasing potential for significant future risk exposure in the field. This thesis will describe the current state of domestic and international oversight systems relevant to synthetic biology, and characterize their limits and vulnerabilities. It will argue that the current approach of relying on prescriptive, sequence-based controls creates growing gaps in oversight for a field moving toward amalgam organisms, and that the soft methods intended to bridge these gaps, predominantly in the form of institutional biosafety committees, are instead points of additional significant vulnerability. This thesis will also illustrate the challenges that have arisen because of these gaps, both in theory and in practice, through an examination of the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM). iGEM, a university-level synthetic biology contest, first served as a valuable case study for illuminating challenges associated with the current system. Later, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Program on Emerging Technologies collaborated with iGEM to establish the competition as a policy testbed for demonstrating innovative approaches to biosafety oversight. This thesis will conclude by proposing recommendations for improving biosafety oversight based on lessons learned from the iGEM testbed. First, it is not enough for scientists to recognize that risks exist in their field; as the first line of defense in risk management, they must also be able to identify, understand, and engage with the risks inherent in their own work. Second, in light of the limits imposed on policy revisions due to political gridlock, it is necessary to understand what can be realistically accomplished within the existing federal system, and what instead needs to be achieved outside it. Here, a fuller, more invigorated approach to engagement support is coupled with a mix of improved, adaptive interpretations of the existing oversight system.",2014,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,Bridging gaps in synthetic biology oversight,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,"Book Title: Bridging gaps in synthetic biology oversight : iGEM as a testbed for proactive, adaptive risk management",,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the hands of practitioners and policy-makers, behavioral interventions are a tool which can be used to potentially reduce the complexity of privacy decisions for users, leading to better outcomes. This dissertation explores the application of different behavioral interventions to contexts currently unexplored in the literature and examines whether they can be made more effective. In addition, this dissertation contributes to policy discussions regarding behavioral interventions for privacy decisions by examining how data protection regulation has impacted the presence and strength of behavioral interventions on websites. In Chapter 2 of this dissertation, I present the results of three online experiments aimed at investigating whether nudges (a type of behavioral intervention) tailored to various psychometric scales can influence participants’ disclosure choices. Across each of these experiments, we do not find significant effects robustly linking any of the measured psychometric variables to differences in disclosure rates. In Chapter 3, I examine whether providing explanations (a different type of behavioral intervention) for recommendations about hypothetical privacy decisions impacts the rate at which participants adopt the recommendations. The results do not find strong evidence linking the tested explanations to hypothetical adoption intent. Across both chapters, I describe the study designs and contextualize the null results, drawing lessons about the robustness of behavioral interventions in the context of real user behaviors. In Chapter 4, I leverage longitudinal data from a large panel of websites to investigate the dynamics of privacy notice design over time in order to comment on the potential impacts of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation on the presence and strength of behavioral interventions within privacy notices. The results identify geographic disparities in the prevalence of privacy notices in the US compared to the EU. I additionally identify a shift away from more coercive responses on US websites and a shift towards consent responses on EU websites. I discuss the implications of these results, limitations, and possible directions for future research. Finally, in Chapter 5, I conclude this dissertation by discussing considerations practitioners should take into account when considering behavioral interventions for privacy decisions and lessons for policy-makers regarding the use of behavioral interventions in public policy.",2023,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,1101970 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 1101970 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Economics; 160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current discourse surrounding web tracking has focused on the collection of browsing data and its use in the estimated $566B online advertising industry in the United States. As a result, existing privacy protections, both through tools like ad blockers and policy mechanisms like cookie consent banners, have been designed to provide a binary choice to users: either opt-in or optout of web tracking. To the user, this frames the issue of web tracking, and all derived use of data collected therein, as either inherently good or bad. However, this thesis demonstrates browsing data collected through web tracking can be used to both inflict privacy harm and to provide security benefits to users—providing evidence that the emphasis of our current privacy framework should be placed on data use, not data collection. Our limited understanding of web tracking, and its potential uses, derives from the lack of reliable browsing data that is available to researchers. While information about how users browse the web is abundantly collected in the private sector, for proprietary reasons it is rarely distributed. As such, this thesis starts with an examination of recruitment and retention in several longitudinal measurement panels, a recently employed method that has provided researchers with detailed browsing data collected over long periods of time. We provide a set of best practices and recommendations for the design of future web browsing studies. Using data from one of these panels, we then provide an updated and more detailed snapshot of how users browse the web. Among other findings, we demonstrate that individual browsing patterns are relatively unique but also habitual, and that there are common patterns leading users to less travelled, riskier areas of the internet. Building upon this foundation, in subsequent chapters we demonstrate that user browsing data collected through web tracking can be used to the detriment of users’ privacy but also to improve security outcomes. In terms of privacy harms, we first show that a user’s unique browsing behavior, their behavioral fingerprint, can be used to greatly reduce online anonymity and, combined with browser fingerprinting, can provide trackers with robust crosssite tracking methods without using browser cookies. Next, we demonstrate that information about visiting sensitive websites can be inferred from the advertising profiles generated by a major data aggregator, indicating that even legitimate use of browsing data presents a privacy risk to users. Finally, we also show that there are security benefits to web tracking by detecting user exposure to malicious websites based on their prior browsing activity. Based on these findings, we recommend that the current privacy framework surrounding web tracking place greater emphasis on how browsing data is used, rather than simply its collection. We evaluate a range of use cases for browsing data, provide recommendations to policymakers, and advocate for an expansion of user choice that involves options to consent to data collection <em>for specific purposes</em>. We close with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities that the dual nature of web tracking presents and make recommendations for future research.",2023,5/20/25 15:32,5/20/25 15:32,5/20/25 15:32,7506651 Bytes,,,,,,Tracking User Web Browsing Behavior,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 7506651 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Theoretical Computer Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach relies on the assumption that users provided with notice will make informed choices that align with their privacy expectations. The goal of this research is to empirically inform industry and regulatory efforts that rely on notice and choice to protect people’s online privacy. To do so, we present a set of case studies covering different aspects of privacy notice and choice in four domains: online behavioral advertising (OBA), online social networks (OSN), financial privacy notices, and websites’ machine-readable privacy notices. We investigate users’ privacy preferences, information needs, and ability to exercise choices in the OBAdomain. Based on our results, we provide recommendations to improve the design of notice and choice methods currently in use in this domain. In the context of OSNs, we explore the effect of nudging notices designed to encourage more thoughtful disclosures among Facebook users and recommend changes to the Facebook user interface aimed to mitigate problematic disclosures. We demonstrate how standardized notices enable large-scale evaluations and comparisons of companies’ privacy practices and argue that standardized privacy notices have an enormous potential to improve transparency and benefit users, privacy-respectful companies, and oversight entities. We argue that, in today’s complex Internet ecosystem, an approach that relies on users to make privacy decisions should also empower them with user-friendly interfaces, relevant information, and the tools they need to make privacy decisions. Finally, we further argue that notice and choice are necessary, but not sufficient to protect online privacy, and that government regulation is necessary to establish necessary additional protections including access, redress, accountability, and enforcement.",12/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721124.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this fact, almost no research has been done on their levels of disaster preparedness. In this dissertation, I use mixed quantitative and qualitative methods to explain variation in the levels of disaster preparedness among CBOs. My goal is to understand which organizational characteristics are highly correlated with disaster preparedness and which characteristics seem to have no effect on preparedness. By doing so, I hope to help CBOs—and therefore their clients—become better prepared for disasters. To complete my dissertation, I rely on data I helped gather while working as a Graduate Research Assistant on BayPrep, a joint research project of the University of Colorado Natural Hazards Center and the Fritz Institute. I utilize factor analysis to condense numerous measures of disaster preparedness into a manageable number of artificial dimensions known as factors. Then, I construct multivariate regression models that examine the effects of organizational characteristics on the previously generated disaster preparedness factors. Finally, I enrich and validate my quantitative results with the qualitative data I gathered while conducting in-depth interviews with the executives of the CBOs in this study.

SK4QUT6Q,thesis,2010,"Gresham, R. Lee",Geologic CO2 Sequestration and Subsurface Property Rights: A Legal and Economic Analysis,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Geologic_CO_sub_2_sub_Sequestration_and_Subsurface_Property_Rights_A_Legal_and_Economic_Analysis/6718082/1,"Carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) from the combustion of fossil fuels must be reduced on a large scale to mitigate the effects of global climate change. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has the potential to allow the continued use of fossil fuels with little or no emissions until alternative, low-to-zero emission sources of energy are more widely deployed. This thesis considers the legal and economic implications of securing the right to use geologic pore space—the microscopic space in subsurface rock matrixes—in an effort to sequester CO2 deep underground to mitigate climate change. The findings and conclusions drawn in this thesis are intended to help guide discussion, research, and decision-making processes undertaken by policymakers and industry leaders with respect to the commercial-scale deployment of CCS. Prior to the commencement of sequestration, a project developer/operator must have authorization to access and use pore space to avoid liability for subsurface trespass. This authorization can be acquired via bilateral contract, where monetary compensation is remitted to the property owner in exchange for the right to use pore space. However, the question remains open as to whether the use of pore space for geologic CO2 sequestration (GCS) is a trespass requiring compensation under the law. In fact, there is ample legal precedent in the context of underground injection activities such as enhanced hydrocarbon recovery, fluid waste disposal, and freshwater storage to support the supposition that the invasion of pore space by injected is compensable only when substantial harm or interference with an existing or non-speculative, investment-backed future use of the subsurface results from the injection of such fluids. This thesis shows that if CCS is widely deployed, the cost of electricity and power plant profitability could be adversely affected by a legal requirement that pore space owners must be compensated for GCS in all circumstances. Moreover, absent unrealistically high electricity prices or some form of sequestration subsidy, pore space has no net-positive, intrinsic economic value to electric generators that can be passed along to property owners. Therefore, while paying property owners to use of pore space for geologic CO2 sequestration may very well foster public acceptance and appease staunch private property rights advocates, there is no demonstrable legal or economic rationale for compensating property owners who have no current or nonspeculative, investment-backed future use of the subsurface where pore space targeted for sequestration is located. A pragmatic and equitable solution for constraining the potential negative economic effects associated with acquiring pore space rights would be for state or federal legislatures, or courts, to limit required compensation to only those instances where the injection and migration of CO2 materially impairs current or non-speculative, investment-backed future uses of the subsurface. Future work should include a detailed analysis of takings law and the anticipated long-term constitutional and economic implications of various approaches to pore space property rights governance before new CCS-specific laws are enacted. The models presented in this thesis should also be applied to additional site-specific geologic data for saline aquifer sequestration targets. Additionally, the implications of GCS paired with enhanced oil recovery (EOR) on power plant economics should be studied.",12/1/10,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,Geologic CO2 Sequestration and Subsurface Property Rights,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6718082.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SKS7F8DI,thesis,2014,"Min, Jihoon","Energy Efficient Lighting: Consumer Preferences, Choices, and System Wide Effects",,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Energy_Efficient_Lighting_Consumer_Preferences_Choices_and_System_Wide_Effects/6716246/1,"Lighting accounts for nearly 20% of overall U.S. electricity consumption, 14% of U.S. residential electricity consumption, and 6% of total U.S. carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions. A transition to alternative energy-efficient technologies could reduce this energy consumption considerably. We studied three questions related to energy efficiency lighting choices and consequences, which are: • Question 1: How large is the system-wide effect of a residential lighting retrofit with more efficient lighting technologies? • Question 2: Based on stated preference (SP) data, which factors influence consumer choices for general service light bulbs? What is the effect of the new lighting efficiency label mandated by the Federal Trade Commission? • Question 3: What can we learn about market trends and consumer choices from consumer panel data (i.e. revealed preference (RP) data) for general service light bulbs between 2004 and 2009? How can we compare the findings from SP and RP data, and which findings are robust across the two? In Chapter 2, we focus on the issue of lighting heat replacement effects. The issue is as follows: lighting efficiency goals have been emphasized in various U.S. energy efficiency policies. However, incandescent bulbs release up to 95% of input energy as heat, and it has been argued that replacing them with more efficient alternatives has a side effect in the overall building energy consumption: it increases the heating service that needs to be provided by the heating systems and decreases the cooling service that needs to be provided by the cooling systems. We investigate the net energy consumption, CO2e emissions, and saving in energy bills for single family detached houses across the U.S. as one moves towards more efficient lighting systems. In some regions, these heating and cooling effects from more efficient lighting can undermine up to 40% of originally intended primary energy savings, erode anticipated carbon savings completely, and lead to 30% less household monetary savings than intended. However, this overall effect is at most one percent of total emissions or energy consumption by a house. The size of the effect depends on various regional factors such as climate, electricity fuel mix, differences in emission factors of main energy sources used for heating and cooling, and electricity prices. Other tested factors such as building orientation, insulation level, occupancy scenario, or day length do not significantly affect the results. Then, in Chapter 3, we focus on factors that drive consumer choices for light bulbs. We collected stated preference data from a choice-based conjoint field experiment with 183 participants. We estimate discrete choice models from the data and find that politically liberal consumers have a stronger preference for compact fluorescent lighting technology and for low energy consumption. Greater willingness-to-pay for lower energy consumption and longer life is observed in conditions where estimated operating cost information was provided. Providing estimated annual cost information to consumers reduces their implicit discount rate by a factor of five, lowering barriers to adoption of energy efficient alternatives with higher up-front costs; however, even with cost information provided, consumers continue to use implicit discount rates of around 100%, which is larger than that estimated for other energy technologies. Finally, we complemented the stated preference study with a revealed preference study. This is because stated preference data alone have limitations in explaining consumer choices, as purchases are affected by many other factors that are outside of the experimenter control. We investigate consumer preferences for lighting technology based on revealed preference data between 2004 and 2009. We assess the trends in lighting sales for different lighting technologies across the country, and by store type. We find that, across the period between 2004 and 2009, sales of all general service light bulbs are almost monotonically decreasing, while CFL sales peaked in 2007. Thanks to increasing adoption of CFLs during the period, newly purchased light bulbs contributed to lowering carbon emissions and electricity consumption, while not sacrificing total produced lumens as much. We study consumer preferences for real light bulbs by estimating choice models, from which we estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) for light bulb attributes (watt and type) and implicit discount rates (IDR) consumers adopt for their purchases. We find that the campaign for efficient bulbs in Wal-Mart in 2007 is potentially related to the peak in CFL adoption in 2007 in addition to the effects of the EISA or other factors/programs around the same period. Consumers are willing to pay, $1.84 more for a change from an incandescent bulb to a CFL and -$0.06 for 10W increase, the values which also include willingness-to-pays for corresponding changes in unobserved variables such as life and color. IDRs for four representative states range between around 230% and 330%, which is in a similar range we estimate from the choice experiment. Overall, even with energy efficiency labels, nationwide promotion of CFLs by retailers, or better availability of CFLs in the transforming residential lighting market, we see the barriers to energy efficient residential lighting are still persistent, which are reflected in high implicit discount rates observed from the models. While we can expect the EISA to be effective in lowering the barriers through regulation, it alone will not close energy efficiency gap in the residential lighting sector.",12/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:26,,,,,,,Energy Efficient Lighting,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716246.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, issues involving ethanol production cost, emissions resulting from land use change, and infrastructure requirements may incur significant social costs. This dissertation examines social costs from different aspects of biofuel production, distribution, and consumption in an effort to inform policies that could reduce these costs. This dissertation contains seven research chapters that examine social costs of ethanol at different points along the supply chain. This work begins by examining some impacts of cellulosic feedstock production. Land use change, especially indirect land use change, has been the most controversial topic within the biofuel research community in recent years, with some findings indicating that biofuels could be more carbon‐intensive than gasoline. However, cost reductions from cellulosic ethanol could be used to more than offset the increased emissions if policies are in place to balance the impacts. Ethanol production from forest thinnings, on the other hand, could result in a positive externality by reducing wildfire damage while also providing funds for additional fuel treatments. Decisions regarding cellulosic ethanol facility size and location can have significant impacts on production cost. Cellulosic ethanol refinery investments over the next 12 years are expected to be on the order of $100 billion, so these decisions could be costly if made suboptimally. The rest of the thesis examines costs and impacts of ethanol distribution, promoting a regional fuel strategy that would have ethanol consumed in high‐level blends (such as E85) in regions where it can be produced (mainly the Midwest and Southeast) rather than in low‐level blends throughout the country. Regional distribution would save billions of dollars per year in shipping costs and reduce shipping loads and congestion costs along the rail freight network. Imports of sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil could be part of this regional fuel strategy, but costs for shipping the fuel from plants to ports within Brazil could be substantial. A key component of this regional fuel strategy is the penetration of both flex‐fuel vehicles and E85 infrastructure throughout ethanol producing regions, but these costs are generally less than the savings from reduced shipping costs. Next‐generation biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol will play an increasing role in meeting transportation energy demand in the near future. This research will hopefully help shape policies that will allow cellulosic ethanol to meet demand while limiting social cost.",8/1/10,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:23,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714815.v1,,"/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/FTJXVHKI/Kocoloski - 2010 - Approaches to Reducing the Social Cost of Biofuel Production, Distribution, and Consumption.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differentiated reliability services beyond the standard level utilize advanced metering infrastructure, automated distribution reconfiguration and distributed generation (DG). The service quality at the standard level is regulated, while high reliability services are offered through a market mechanism. This proposed market mechanism is designed in two different models of managing the distribution networks. The first model assumes that an independent distribution system operator (DSO) as an administrative firm provides operational support for delivery and reliability services in a retail market, while the second model does not have a DSO. Main reliability market participants are distribution utilities, retail electricity providers (REPs), non-utility-owned DG units, and end users. The REPs, as end users’ representatives and aggregators, purchase delivery service with high reliability level and backup power from the utilities and DG units, respectively. The prices for these services are based on bidding by all market participants. Bids are created by each market participant optimizing its objective with respect to its own interests; therefore, the market participant can assess the investment costs and manage its own risk in setting the service charge. Notably, the proposed market mechanism, which is based on knowing customers’ willingness to pay, and preferences for reliability, aims to give long-term investment signals to service providers for planning investments in new technologies at value. In addition, the provision of high reliability services can be considered a means that enables the service providers to improve system resilience. The modified IEEE Roy Billinton Test System Bus 2 is simulated to demonstrate proof-of-concept for the proposed retail market by showing the iii process of settling the service prices and utilities’ expected compensation design. By comparing the settled service prices between the two market models, we show that the service prices are quite similar, but the number of end users obtaining backup power is different.",12/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721334.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SR9L6P2C,thesis,2014,"McNamara, Julie H.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program","Bridging gaps in synthetic biology oversight: iGEM as a testbed for proactive, adaptive risk management",,,,,,"On the surface, the emerging field of synthetic biology looks highly similar to that of genetic engineering. However, the two fields are based upon divergent underlying logic structures. Whereas genetic engineering affects change through localized modifications of existing organisms, synthetic biology attempts to fuse independent component parts to create wholly novel applications. While legacy regulatory systems were adequate for monitoring biosafety in the early days of the emerging field, as synthetic biology advances, the fundamental differences in its logic structure are creating fissures in the oversight system. A continued reliance on increasingly incompatible mechanisms squanders the limited present opportunity for proactive risk management, and generates increasing potential for significant future risk exposure in the field. This thesis will describe the current state of domestic and international oversight systems relevant to synthetic biology, and characterize their limits and vulnerabilities. It will argue that the current approach of relying on prescriptive, sequence-based controls creates growing gaps in oversight for a field moving toward amalgam organisms, and that the soft methods intended to bridge these gaps, predominantly in the form of institutional biosafety committees, are instead points of additional significant vulnerability. This thesis will also illustrate the challenges that have arisen because of these gaps, both in theory and in practice, through an examination of the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM). iGEM, a university-level synthetic biology contest, first served as a valuable case study for illuminating challenges associated with the current system. Later, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Program on Emerging Technologies collaborated with iGEM to establish the competition as a policy testbed for demonstrating innovative approaches to biosafety oversight. This thesis will conclude by proposing recommendations for improving biosafety oversight based on lessons learned from the iGEM testbed. First, it is not enough for scientists to recognize that risks exist in their field; as the first line of defense in risk management, they must also be able to identify, understand, and engage with the risks inherent in their own work. Second, in light of the limits imposed on policy revisions due to political gridlock, it is necessary to understand what can be realistically accomplished within the existing federal system, and what instead needs to be achieved outside it. Here, a fuller, more invigorated approach to engagement support is coupled with a mix of improved, adaptive interpretations of the existing oversight system.",2014,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,Bridging gaps in synthetic biology oversight,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,"Book Title: Bridging gaps in synthetic biology oversight : iGEM as a testbed for proactive, adaptive risk management",,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Early College High School (ECHS) design can bridge the transitional gap that exists between high school and college and increase the potential of higher graduation rates in high school and post-secondary institutes and is one of many responses to these concerns. This mixed-methods study sought to discover students' self-perceptions of college readiness in the areas of academics, expectations, and emotions as a result of participating in an ECHS. The academic readiness was examined through an analysis of student reflections on academic readiness on the ""Perceptions, Expectations, Emotions, and Knowledge"" about college (PEEK) scales (Weinstein, Palmer & Hanson, 1995) instrument and their college entrance examination scores derived from the ""Computer-Adaptive Placement Assessment Support System"" (COMPASS) (ACT, 2006) examination.

Access to electricity is essential to eradicating energy poverty and empowering individuals, communities and economies, to reach their potential. Globally, 1.3 billion people, mainly in less developed countries, lack access to electricity. While central grid extension often provides electricity at very low cost, the reliability of the central grid in less developed countries is so low that the priority given by policy makers to central grid extension must be questioned. Rather than maximizing the extent of often unreliable or simply unenergized central grid extensions, we demonstrate the imperative to consider a multi-track approach to electricity access that includes microgrids and high quality solar lighting products. Through case studies and modeling efforts based on extensive empirical data, we provide new insight to this imperative and elucidate the nature of the challenges and solutions for microgrids to eradicate energy poverty.",12/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Microgrids and High - Quality Central Grid Alternatives,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720587.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To enable more accurate and timely decisions, we need to optimize the performance of the human-AI team directly. In this thesis, we utilize a mathematical framing of the human-AI team and propose a set of methods that optimize the AI, the human, and the interface in which they communicate to enable better team performance. We first show how to provably train AI classifiers that complement humans and can defer the decision to humans when it is best to do so. However, in specific settings, AI cannot autonomously make decisions and thus only provides advice to humans. In that case, we build onboarding procedures that train humans to have an accurate mental model of the AI to enable appropriate reliance. Finally, we study how humans interact with large language models (LLMs) to write code. To understand current inefficiencies, we developed a taxonomy to categorize programmers' interactions with the LLM. Motivated by insight from the taxonomy, we leverage human feedback to know when to best display LLM suggestions.",2024,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Training human-AI teams,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dissertation shows how economic and social welfare analysis can be used to inform the design of a CCN architecture that provides network stakeholders with incentives to deploy and use. Firstly, the dissertation investigates the economic incentives of different stakeholders to deploy content-centric network Internet architectures and shows that network operators will fail to deploy sufficient storage infrastructure to support CCN without payment ows from publishers. However, the level of payment required differs for different network players, which gives them different competitive advantages in providing storage infrastructure and content delivery services. Secondly, it evaluates the social welfare implications of different storage deployment scenarios in a CCN-based architecture and identifies two deployments that maximize social welfare. In the first, edge networks provide the storage infrastructure through a transaction broker. In the second, edge networks pay third-parties an amount, equivalent to the realized benefits from a storage node, to deploy storage infrastructure in the network. All other deployment scenarios lead to a deadweight loss. Thirdly, the dissertation identifies content delivery functionalities that break in a CCN-based architecture and shows how these functionalities can be successfully replicated and enhanced by a careful design of the structure of routable content, content naming and the meta-information added to content. The proposed design supports several content delivery applications and can be easily extended to other networking principals. Finally, the dissertation identifies and discusses threats in the CCN content delivery model and proposes some mechanisms to address these threats. In addition, the dissertation identifies some policy implications of the CCN content delivery model and proposes some policy interventions that may lead to desirable deployment outcomes.",5/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Economic Incentives in Content-Centric Networking,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716135.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study addresses that gap in the literature, and serves the interests of those who seek an understanding of divination as it is practiced in contemporary Western society. This study explores the world of psychic-mediums, people who practice a type of divination that involves receiving, interpreting, and communicating both psychic impressions and communications from disincarnate entities. To understand psychic-mediums, the study examines their experiences, assumptions, and views of themselves and their profession, as well as their core assumptions and beliefs. A developmental model of consciousness is used as the basis for understanding the findings. Twenty psychic-mediums completed a questionnaire based on a developmental model of consciousness. A subset of 6 of these participants then participated in an in-depth interview, focusing on their life histories and perceptions of their psychic and mediumship experiences. The results were analyzed for both commonalities in themes and differences in the histories and beliefs. Themes that emerged were examined in the context of developmental theories of consciousness. The results showed that despite some important variations, the participants had many common beliefs and attitudes about their work, as well as about topics such as spirituality and the afterlife. An important finding was that the interview participants all viewed their work as psychics and mediums as a healing profession, rather than as entertainment or within some other context. The interview participants all exhibited a high degree of independence in their attitudes towards their work and their personal belief systems. Nonetheless, they also displayed a strong tendency towards flexibility and regarded their views as relative and conditioned by their own experiences and culture. In terms of consciousness development, the interview participants supported the survey results, which suggested a strong tendency towards self-actualization and authentic consciousness.",2011,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,Divination as a life path in contemporary America,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Divination as a life path in contemporary America: An in-depth exploration of the world of psychic-mediums ISBN: 9781124902180 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 12 Pages: 4584 Volume: 72,,,,,Attitudes; Divination; Metaphysics; Parapsychology; Religiousness; Social psychology; Spirituality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The monetization of QoS of data can be managed by traffic management and performance optimization policies. This traffic prioritization can be application specific as well as application agnostic, but essentially based on user choice and in compliance with Net Neutrality principles. The mobile operators' quest to evolve from their ""dumb bit pipe"" role to become more involved in shaping the user experience through collaborative innovation with application developers and content providers is the main driver behind this concept. Three case studies, have been evaluated in this thesis, namely 1) zero.facebook.com, where Facebook collaborates with mobile operators across the world to bundle a stripped down Facebook application version with a mobile connection, 2) collaboration between Google Voice and Sprint where Sprint is adding Over The Top Google Voice minutes to its mobile plans, and 3) NTT DoCoMo's i-mode, which served as a revolutionary concept in the mobile services, as a traditional mobile operator reshaped the consumer experience through customized service offerings and by getting involved in almost all sectors of the telecommunication value chain. The common parameters identified in these case studies, combined with the findings of interviews with over fifty stakeholders across the telecommunications value chain, have been brought together in the aggregated model presented in this thesis; ""collaborative innovation"" and ""user experience control"" are identified as two significant factors driving the rationale behind monetization of QoS of mobile data.

This population has been predominantly overlooked by the academy apart from the Family Lifestyles Study completed at UCLA twenty years ago. In this, the first study of its kind, I explore the ethnological specificity of this set of people, Post-Cool Kids. I have integrated the methodologies of Michel Foucault and the theories of archetypal psychology developed by James Hillman with work done by Victor Turner as well as other work from the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, literary criticism, feminist theory, cultural studies and histories of the sixties era. I use this interdisciplinary data to inform a qualitative study of eighteen subjects raised by countercultural parents. I asked my subjects about their lives as children, teenagers, young adults, and currently approaching midlife. Through an analysis of these interviews I identified six cultural complexes specific to the counterculture that I then deconstructed and discussed as systems of knowing within the American culture of the last forty years: freedom, anti-authority, intense experience, cool, being real, and utopia. These complexes together provide a unique way of experiencing the world that informs the ethnological and psychological perspective of Post-Cool Kids, and provides them with a multi-schematic, process-based way of engaging with the world around them. I also discuss such topics as alternative education, communal experiences, drug addiction, creative thinking, embodied trauma, parental entwinement, and personal activism. My objective was to identify the transmission of culture from counterculture parents to their Post-Cool Kids. In the process I developed several unique methodological approaches. Merging postmodern theory, archetypal psychology and methods from religious studies and anthropology, I evaluate the nature of belief within a secular cultural context. Ultimately, I place American historical concepts of utopia side by side with the experience and multi-schematic perspective of Post-Cool Kids to suggest that they represent an emergent pattern in culture, and show how they can inform new theories of utopia.",2013,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,Post-cool kids,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Post-cool kids: How the children born into the counterculture of the American 1960s and 70s became a scattered, disorganized, postmodern tribe ISBN: 9781303075322 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 9 Volume: 74",,,,,Children; Counterculture; Ethnology; Parents; Psychology; Social psychology; Utopias,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TEFKZGCG,thesis,2019,"Sergi, Brian",Integrating Climate and Health Damages in Decision-Making for the Electric Power Sector,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Integrating_Climate_and_Health_Damages_in_Decision-Making_for_the_Electric_Power_Sector/8204723/1,"This dissertation explores the connection between the climate and health impacts of emissions, focusing primarily on the electric power sector. The combustion of fossil fuels is a critical source of carbon dioxide— the principal greenhouse gas driving climate change—and of conventional air pollutants that are detrimental to human health. In this work, we explore the connection between these impacts by examining their role in shaping public support for emissions reductions, by advancing methods for quantifying the health impacts of emissions, and by investigating the benefits of directly linking and co-optimizing for benefits related to these two impacts during the design of policies for emissions reductions. In Chapter 2, we conduct a U.S.-based discrete choice survey to explore the influence of climate and health information on respondents’ support for reducing emissions. We find that, on average, respondents value information on the climate and health impacts of emissions, and are willing to pay more for emissions reductions that target both health and climate benefits simultaneously than they are for scenarios that address only climate or health alone. Respondents also demonstrate that their support for renewable energy sources is largely driven by the perceived health and climate benefits those sources would provide. These findings highlight the importance of communicating these types of benefits when advancing emissions reductions or policies intended to further clean energy. We extend this line of questioning in Chapter 3, in which we conduct a similar survey among residents of ten Chinese cities. In addition to the survey structure from Chapter 2, we use observed air quality data from the locations of the respondents to explore whether air pollution at different time-scales (e.g. hourly, daily, or annual averages) shows any relationship with preferences for emissions reductions. As with the U.S.-based survey, the average respondent demonstrates a willingness to pay more in electricity bills for cleaner energy sources, and in particular sources that are expected to address both health and climate issues. While short-term air quality levels show no relationship with respondents’ support for emissions cuts, respondents in areas of historically worse air quality demonstrate substantially higher willingness to pay for reducing emissions to improve human health, suggesting the importance of awareness of long-term pollution trends to building support for emissions reductions. Having explored how the public interacts with information on the climate and health impacts of emissions, Chapter 4 sets out to evaluate the health effects of air pollution in the U.S. We use an integrated assessment model with reduced complexity air quality modeling and emissions data from 2008, 2011, and 2014 to estimate county-level ambient particulate matter concentrations, population exposure, and finally health consequences, with a focus on how the location of those consequences relate to the origin of emissions. We estimate that total health damages in the U.S. declined from 2008 to 2014, driven largely by the closure of point sources like coal power plants. Despite this, some counties incur increasing per capita health damages over that time period. Though decreasing slightly over time, a large share of health damages continues to be attributable to pollution originating in a different location from where the damages are incurred, implying a sustained need for integrated and transboundary approaches to managing air pollution. Finally, Chapter 5 builds on the previous work by examining how estimates of the health impacts of emissions might be incorporated into the design of policies intended to address climate change for the electric power sector. Using data on the existing fossil fuel fleet and information on the marginal damage of pollution from the analysis in Chapter 4, we investigate how changing the location of power plant retirements and emissions reductions might achieve the same climate goals while maximizing health benefits. We find that using health to inform which plants retire and are replaced by natural gas can increase health benefits by close to one-third while incurring relatively incremental mitigation costs. These gains are in addition to the substantial health benefits achieved by a climate-only approach and are fairly robust to uncertainty and subjective parameter decisions. Policy makers might incorporate these findings by more directly considering the health implications of different pathways for achieving climate targets.",5/31/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/8204723.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/GHRIS5N7/Sergi - 2019 - Integrating Climate and Health Damages in Decision-Making for the Electric Power Sector.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THBCAGW8,thesis,2016,"Levi, Patricia Janet; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Feasibility of grid compatible microgrids,,,,,,"There are 1.1 billion people in the world who lack access to electricity, mostly in rural areas. The expansion of the central grid has been slow in many developing countries, hampered by a lack of supply, poor finances, and politics. Distribution companies in these countries are often cash strapped, in a tremendous amount of debt and are unable to make adequate investments in infrastructure. Off-grid technologies can be the most cost-effective choice in remote areas, and they also can offer a solution for communities that will not receive reliable centralized electricity for many years. These solutions include solar home systems and microgrids. However, investment in microgrids has been discouraged by the risk of the central grid expanding into the service area of a microgrid. An attractive solution is to create technical standards for microgrids such that they are able to connect to the grid if or when it arrives, and to provide regulations for the integration of these systems into the operation of the main grid. This arrangement could reduce the risk to microgrid investors significantly. While existing literature speculates on the value of such a system, the costs and benefits have not been quantified. This analysis uses the Reference Electrification Model, a tool developed in collaboration by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and IIT Comillas - Madrid, to assess the costs and benefits that might arise when using grid compatible microgrids. These results and an assessment of the regulatory context and forthcoming regulations show that grid compatible microgrids can provide significant social value, but only if supported by sufficient subsidies and a recognition of the costs imposed on society by depriving so many people of electricity.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Feasibility of grid compatible microgrids,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technology refers to hardware, software and telecommunication systems used in the management and processing of information. Information is the result of data processing, collection and analysis that can add knowledge to the recipient of the information while communication is a process of transferring information, feelings, ideas and thoughts from one individual to another individual or group of individuals.ICT is a very important medium in daily work where human life today is dominated by technology. ICT not only simplifies and eases human work but also changes the way people live today. Through this ICT facility, users can access and obtain information quickly and quickly and can avoid wasting time and energy.Malaysia today is in the era of ICT progress by the year 2020. Malaysia will emerge as a developed country where today the government is trying to implement various programs on ICT that aim to provide benefits and benefits to Malaysia and society in particular. In moving towards the ICT era, various innovations have been introduced especially in the Public Service System (SPA). Changes and reforms in the SPA are very necessary as the scenario inside and outside the country is getting more complicated and challenging. The process of globalization, liberalization and ICT development that is increasing rapidly demands SPA to make various efforts to reform and improve the system.Therefore, the government is working on pioneering the MSC mega project as a stage to prepare for this information revolution. Malaysia is not lagging behind in implementing the electronic government (EG) policy to take advantage of the use of ICT as an agent of progress in public services. Electronic Government aims to increase the productivity and effectiveness of public services towards more outstanding achievements through the use of ICT. Malaysia also hopes that the use of ICT will have a positive impact on the country's economic, political, social and administrative development.The use of ICT is growing rapidly and the main purpose is to smooth and speed up the management system for an organization. The main goal of government departments switching to the use of ICT is to improve their productivity and service quality where Malaysia wants to form a government that is oriented towards the use of ICT and further eliminate the use of paper in all administrative matters or better known as online government services. When compared to manual work methods, the use of ICT can save a large part of time and energy that can be used for other tasks.Online services are now becoming increasingly important where according to the Director General of the Malaysian Administration Modernization and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU), Datuk Mohamad Zabidi Zainal, 90 percent of government services will be provided online by 2015. This is set out in the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) which needs to be achieved in line with efforts to transform existing services into online services by fully utilizing the speed of ICT (Daily News, 27 January 2012). Therefore, all departments are urged to make a paradigm shift in their management system through the use of ICT. The purpose is to increase efficiency in working and produce effective work.However, in terms of the implementation of the use of ICT in public services, there are still a few staff who refuse to use all the facilities provided. This was confirmed by the secretary of the Sabah Federation, Datuk Muhammad Hatta Ab. Aziz while inaugurating an ICT seminar at the Sabah National Institute of Public Administration (INTAN) campus (Bernama, 1 January 2011).",2015,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,may,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Keberkesanan Penggunaan Teknologi Maklumat Dan Komunikasi (ICT) Di Jabatan Penguatkuasaan Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur (DBKL) ISBN: 9798380466271,,,,,Information technology; Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anecdotal evidence has suggested that hydroelectric generation can provide significant benefits in power systems that have already significantly increased their power generation from intermittent renewable resources. A heuristic-based algorithm for optimizing the scheduling of hydroelectric power generation facilities was developed and integrated into the Low-Emissions Electricity Market Analysis (LEEMA) model to analyze the interaction of generation capacity from wind, thermal, and hydro resources in the economic dispatch of individual generation plants. The algorithm identifies the most costly periods of thermal production, considering fuel, startup and operation and maintenance costs, to determine the optimal schedule of hydro generation within its capacity constraints. The hydrothermal LEEMA model is run on the current Spanish electric power system to identify the impact of introducing hydro generation to a system, varying levels of flexibility in hydro generation, and increasing levels of wind generation. The analysis concludes that hydro generation can significantly reduce the impact of intermittent renewable generation, that the level of flexibility of hydro generation must be understood to determine how beneficial the hydro generation can be, and that hydro generation will delay the most significant impacts of increasing levels of wind generation.",2012,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2012 S.M.,Book Title: The role of hydroelectric generation in electric power systems with large scale wind generation,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the 1999 Institute of Medicine Report, To Err is Human, Building a Safer Health System; there has been an increasingly intensive focus on the prevention of medical errors and the improvement of hospital safety and quality. In more recent years information technology has been identified as having the potential to reduce and prevent a wide range of issues, including medical errors, thus increasing patient safety, improving the quality of care, and reducing costs. Many hospitals and provides have integrated health IT into the patient care process, usually in the form of decision support systems, electronic health records, provider order entry systems, and the like. However, not all providers, clinicians, and researchers are in agreement on the impact these computerized systems have on safety, quality, and patient outcomes. With contradicting results in the literature and gaps in the evidence of the safe and effective use of health IT there is much to be learned in this area. This research project aims to quantify the impact of health IT on hospitals in the United States by investigating inpatient medical claims data, specifically medical errors and mortality rates and how they are impacted by health IT implementation data. The stage of health IT implementation from year to year will be evaluated for its impact on the number of medical errors and mortality rates. Methods To address the study objectives data from two datasets, the HIMSS Analytics datasets, provided by the Healthcare Information Management and Systems Society (HIMSS) and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample (NIS) datasets provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), were aggregated to form the analysis dataset. To accurately match the hospitals in each dataset the hospital’s Medicare ID code was used. Once the datasets were matched, the study outcomes, number of medical errors and mortality rates, were drawn from the HCUP data and the health IT stages was derived from the HIMSS data. The International Classification of Disease version 9 (ICD-9) codes were used to identify medical errors from the HCUP data. To address the primary and secondary objectives, both SAS and SPSS were utilized for data manipulation, data cleaning, and analysis. As part of the analysis descriptive statistics on hospital characteristics were assessed to determine the characteristics of hospitals at different stages of health IT implementation. Additionally, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the effects of health IT on medical errors and mortality rates. Finally multiple regression analysis was performed to determine if health IT stage is a predictor of medical errors and mortality rates. Results More than 530 hospitals were assessed for each of the four study years (2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011). Overall, US hospitals in three of the four years assessed support a significant difference in the mean number of medical errors between health IT stages within each year and for mortality rates all four years demonstrated the a significant amount of the variation in the model could be explained by health IT stage. Additionally, it was demonstrated that Stage 7 and Stage 0 were significantly different indicating that health IT stage can be a predictor for medical errors and mortality rates in three of the four years assessed. Conclusion This study demonstrates that there is an affect on quality of care, measured by medical errors and mortality rates, as it relates to the implementation of health IT. While the results are able to demonstrate this relationship between stages of health IT, further research is needed to assess health IT’s affects on hospital outcomes in greater detail. Additionally, the hospital characteristics associated with hospitals at various levels of health IT provides insight into the available resources for implementation of technology in the clinical setting.",2015,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: The Impact of Health Information Technology on Inpatient Medical Errors in US Hospitals ISBN: 9781339666808,,,,,Bioinformatics; Engineering; Health services administration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I argue that the current scale of social, political, environmental, economic, psychological, and spiritual challenges reflects an underlying “disconnect disorder” (Arabena, 2006), and that these combined external and internal crises present an opportunity for widespread transformative learning and a collective shift. My core hypothesis is that this transition depends on humanity’s ability to engage in a dual process of individual and collective transformation through remembering our connections with ourselves, with one another, with the natural world, and with a sense of purposeful engagement in the world. I investigate this hypothesis through an in-depth, relational study of the Ecology of Leadership program (EOL) at the Regenerative Design Institute (RDI) in Bolinas, California, an organization that aims to “serve as catalyst for a revolution in the way humans relate to the natural world.” The Ecology of Leadership represents a unique model of transformative adult education that incorporates the principles of “inner permaculture” and regenerative design to support participants in cultivating personal and collective transformation. I introduce a “relational” theory and methodological approach, which centralizes Indigenous and ecological principles of relationship, respect, reciprocity, and regeneration. Using interviews (p=20), surveys (p=409), arts-based data (p=12), sharing circles (p=8), and participatory research, I integrate personal and participant narratives together with images, graphics, poems, and practices to bring this case study of the Ecology of Leadership to life. I also advocate for a new model of “regenerative research,” in which the research itself is life-giving and contributes to the healing, transformation, and regeneration of the researcher, the community of research, and the whole system. Based upon my interactions, observations, and interviews in the EOL program and my reflections and supportive research, I conclude by articulating the “Ecology of Transformation,” a holistic model for transformation that incorporates inner and outer change with practices for reconnection to oneself, the natural world, and the village.",2014,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,The ecology of transformation,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: The ecology of transformation: A relational study of the Ecology of Leadership program at the Regenerative Design Institute ISBN: 9781321397161,,,,,Adult education; Astronomy; Educational leadership; Environmental education; Experimental design; Family Relations; Indigenous peoples; Liability (Law); Student newspapers and periodicals; Transformative learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TQL9A5W2,thesis,2015,"Xu, Nora; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Active participation of buildings in the power sector: the case of small office buildings,,,,,,"Under the broad context of decarbonization of the energy sector, commercial buildings are well-suited for providing ancillary services to the electricity grid and poised to transform from passive consumers to active electricity market participants. A data-driven multi-zonal thermal response model is formulated and fit to EnergyPlus simulation data from a Department of Energy Small Office Reference Commercial Building for the months of June, July and August. When validated and tested against EnergyPlus simulation data, the thermal response model performs well. The thermal response model is then used in a co-optimization of energy and ancillary provision for a small office building with a variable air volume system from [9] using summer wholesale electricity and ancillary services prices from ISO-NE. Under six different price cases, the individual small office building provides maximum hourly regulation and spinning reserve capacities of 3.2 and 4.4 kW respectively and daily total regulation and spinning reserve capacities of 51 and 46 kW respectively. When scaled up over similar building stock in New England, small office buildings can provide up to 9.5% of ISO-NE's daily regulation requirement and 8% of the daily spinning reserves requirement. From an economic perspective, a small office building's potential summer ancillary services' revenues are not sufficient to drive investment in installation of a building automation system, variable air volume system and associated metering. However, buildings may invest in the necessary equipment for energy cost reductions and to participate in other demand response programs. Increasing building participation rates in ancillary services markets requires addressing the principal-agent problem, building-specific concerns such as program controllability and convenience and targeted policies aimed at increasing availability of clear aggregator-enabled building participation avenues.",2015,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,Active participation of buildings in the power sector,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Active participation of buildings in the power sector : the case of small office buildings,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TQV993JK,thesis,2012,"Ramesh, C.","Autopsy Study of Unnatural Deaths of Teenagers and Adolescents in the Age Group of 13-21 Years Conducted at Kims Hospital, Bengaluru",,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2848394766?pq-origsite=primo,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Unnatural deaths are the leading killer of today’s teenaged and adolescent generation, as the patterns have changed from infections towards social etiologies during the last decades. The unnatural deaths may be due to unintentional or intentional injuries. Unintentional injuries are mainly accidents and homicides. Intentional injuries are mainly suicides. During the last decade, unnatural deaths were more common than natural deaths (disease) among teenagers and adolescents.Many cultural and socio-economic factors of a country are usually related to the causation of unnatural deaths. The aim of this study is to investigate teenager and adolescents deaths due to unnatural cause in the city of Bangalore. Unintentional injury and suicide are leading causes of death among teenagers/adolescents and reducing this is an important health priority as the people of this age is characterized by hope, drive and ambition. This particular section of the society is very much needed for the building the nation in future. There is limited data on teenager and adolescent mortality particularly from developing countries with unreliable death registration systems. This calls for the use of other sources of data to ascertain cause of teenager and adolescent mortality. Police investigation records provide a valuable source of information on the events leading to the death of an individual, and analysis of these records along with postmortem analysis may help us understanding of the causal pathway, elucidate potential areas for intervention and socio-political system to investigate and develop preventive measures.MATERIALS AND METHODS:Department of Forensic Medicine, KIMS Hospital and Research Centre, Bengaluru is a post graduate Institute which conducts autopsies of all sudden, suspicious, unnatural deaths which occur in and around south Bangalore. The present study is a descriptive study of unnatural death cases of teenagers and adolescents of the age group 13-21 years which were autopsied at KIMS hospital, Bengaluru for a period of 2 years from June 2009 to May 2011.RESULTS:During this period 918 cases were brought for post mortem examination out of which 804 (87.6%) deaths were due unnatural causes. Out of 804 cases of unnatural deaths 114 deaths were of teenagers and adolescents of the age group 13 to 21 years. During the two years of study period 918 cases were autopsied out of which 804 cases (87.6%) cases were unnatural deaths and 114 cases (12.4%) were of natural deaths. Out of 804 cases of unnatural deaths, 114 cases (14.2%) were of teenagers and adolescents belonging to the age group 13 to 21 years. Among 114 cases of unnatural deaths in teenagers and adolescents 20 (17.5%) were in the age group of 13-15 years, 33 (30%) were of 16-18 years and 61(53.5%) cases were of the age group 19-21 years. Out of 114 cases 55 (48.2%) were males and 59 (51.8%) were females. In this study maximum number of unnatural deaths in teenagers and adolescents occurred during night times i.e., 70 cases (61%), followed by 20 cases (18%) during morning, 15 cases (13%) during evening and 9 cases (8%) during afternoon. Out of 114 cases unnatural deaths among teenagers and adolescents, maximum number of victims were from social class III i.e., 51 cases and least among social class V i.e., 10 cases. In this study among 114 deaths 91(79.8%) cases were intentional and 23 (20.2%) cases were unintentional. Among intentional deaths 2 cases (2.2%) were homicidal and 89 cases (97.8%) were suicidal in nature. In case of homicidal deaths both were male victims, while in case of suicidal deaths 36 victims were males and 53 were females. Hanging is the most preferred method used to commit suicide with 68 cases ((76.4%) out of 89 cases, followed by 10 cases (11.2%) of poisoning, 7 cases (7.9%) of burns and 4 cases (4.5%) of fall from height. The cause for committing suicide with 28 cases (31.5%) were due to Insanity/Mental illness, 25 cases (28.1%) were due to family problems, 14 (15.7%) due to illness, 9 (10.1%) each due to love affairs and failure in examination. 3 cases (3.4%) due to dowry related and 1 case (1.1%) due to drug addiction/abuse. Out of 23 cases of unintentional deaths 18 cases (78.3%) were due to road traffic accidents, 2 cases (8.7%) were due to electrocution and 3 cases (13%) were due to drowning. Out of 23 cases of unintentional deaths 20 (87%) were males and 3 (13%) were females. All the deaths due accidents were of unnatural. No accidents due to natural calamities were reported during this study. Out of 18 cases of Road traffic accidents 14 victims were males and 4 victims were females.CONCLUSIONS:Teenage and adolescence are important stages in development. Death among them is the important reasons of potential life loss to the family and society and to some extent it reflects the socio-economic and medical health care status at national and regional levels. It is essential to establish the protective system, enhance the education level among teenagers and adolescents to prevent them from unnatural deaths. So all possible steps of measures should be carried out by the concerned authorities to prevent those unnatural deaths among teenagers and adolescents to improve the situation.",2012,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Autopsy Study of Unnatural Deaths of Teenagers and Adolescents in the Age Group of 13-21 Years Conducted at Kims Hospital, Bengaluru ISBN: 9798380032971",,,,,Clinical psychology; Criminal investigation; Developing countries; Economics; Firearms; Gangs; Law enforcement; Medicine; Mortality; Poisoning; Psychology; Socioeconomic Factors; Sociology; Teenagers; Violence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physical bases for a price relationship are examined. An econometric modeling exercise seeks to establish whether a stable price relationship exists and to define it through the use of a vector error correction model. The model identifies strong evidence of cointegration between the crude oil and natural gas spot price series in the United States. It conditions the predicted natural gas price volatility through exogenous variables related to weather and supply. Once identified, the relationship is clarified more efficiently through the implementation of a conditional error correction model. The model is then utilized to simulate the effects of weather shocks, seasonality, supply deviations and hurricane activity on the cointegrating relationship between crude oil and natural gas. Finally, an analysis is conducted to test whether the relationship shifts over time to new equilibria. The results of the series of exercises suggest that crude oil and natural gas prices have moved together historically and statistical analysis supports the assumption that the two price series continued to be cointegrated through the end of 2008. The analysis presents evidence that the relationship shifts over time to new equilibria, and the data suggest that these new eqilibria are likewise stable.",2010,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: The relationship between crude oil and natural gas spot prices and its stability over time,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concerns that mitigation may be too slow in coming have lead to renewed dialogue within the scientific community regarding potential strategies for counteracting global warming through geoengineering, defined as “the deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth’s climate system, in order to moderate global warming.” (Shepherd et al., 2009) The geoengineering schemes that are considered most feasible today involve planetary albedo modification, or “solar radiation management” (SRM). This thesis addresses several outstanding questions regarding uncertainty in global and regional effects of SRM activities. The technical components of this work are centered on two modeling experiments which use a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) implemented through climateprediction.net. Drawing upon knowledge gained through these experiments and interaction with the broader research community, I explore the international relations implications of SRM and the global governance issues associated with it. The first experiment explored regional differences in climate modified by SRM using a large-ensemble modeling experiment that examines the effects of 54 global temperature stabilization scenarios. Our results confirm other research that shows a world with SRM would generally have less extreme temperature and precipitation anomalies than one with unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions and no SRM, but illustrate the physical unfeasibility of simultaneously stabilizing global precipitation and temperature as long as greenhouse gases continue to rise. Over time, simulated temperature and precipitation in large regions such as China and India vary significantly with different SRM trajectories and diverge from historic baselines in different ways. Hence the use of SRM to stabilize climate in all regions simultaneously may not be possible. Regional diversity in the response to different levels of SRM could complicate what is already a very challenging problem of global governance, and could make consensus about the “optimal” level of geo-engineering difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. The second experiment modeled SRM using a perturbed physics ensemble with a wide range of temperature responses and climate sensitivities, all of which are consistent with observed recent warming. The analysis shows that the efficacy and distribution of effects of SRM varies with the temperature response of the model. Models that produce more global warming are also generally more sensitive to SRM, so the amount of modification of the Earth’s energy balance needed to meet any given climate stabilization criteria appear to be relatively insensitive to climate sensitivity. While in the more sensitive models, SRM is generally less successful in returning regional climates to their unperturbed states the longer it is used to compensate for rising greenhouse gases, it is also where SRM is most effective relative to a no SRM alternative. SRM does not prevent further acidification of the oceans and this fact, coupled with the fact that SRM can only slow, never halt, changes to regional climate states, makes SRM untenable as a long-term solution to the problems caused by rising GHGs in the atmosphere. Much more research on SRM is needed before any conclusions on whether or not to deploy it are reached, but this work suggests that regional inequities in climate response are probably not the main impediment to its effective implementation. While SRM can never perfectly correct for regional climate change, these experiments suggest that it generally reduces (rather than exacerbates) changes to regional temperature and precipitation and greatly reduces the rate of temperature change. Considering the slow progress society has made towards reducing emissions, however, it is important to consider the potential benefits SRM technologies may confer in reducing impacts to buy time for both mitigation and adaptation.",8/1/11,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715088.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study addresses that gap in the literature, and serves the interests of those who seek an understanding of divination as it is practiced in contemporary Western society. This study explores the world of psychic-mediums, people who practice a type of divination that involves receiving, interpreting, and communicating both psychic impressions and communications from disincarnate entities. To understand psychic-mediums, the study examines their experiences, assumptions, and views of themselves and their profession, as well as their core assumptions and beliefs. A developmental model of consciousness is used as the basis for understanding the findings. Twenty psychic-mediums completed a questionnaire based on a developmental model of consciousness. A subset of 6 of these participants then participated in an in-depth interview, focusing on their life histories and perceptions of their psychic and mediumship experiences. The results were analyzed for both commonalities in themes and differences in the histories and beliefs. Themes that emerged were examined in the context of developmental theories of consciousness. The results showed that despite some important variations, the participants had many common beliefs and attitudes about their work, as well as about topics such as spirituality and the afterlife. An important finding was that the interview participants all viewed their work as psychics and mediums as a healing profession, rather than as entertainment or within some other context. The interview participants all exhibited a high degree of independence in their attitudes towards their work and their personal belief systems. Nonetheless, they also displayed a strong tendency towards flexibility and regarded their views as relative and conditioned by their own experiences and culture. In terms of consciousness development, the interview participants supported the survey results, which suggested a strong tendency towards self-actualization and authentic consciousness.",2011,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,Divination as a life path in contemporary America,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Divination as a life path in contemporary America: An in-depth exploration of the world of psychic-mediums ISBN: 9781124902180 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 12 Pages: 4584 Volume: 72,,,,,Attitudes; Divination; Metaphysics; Parapsychology; Religiousness; Social psychology; Spirituality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It swings from the end of the academic system towards the VET; the key attribute of VET education is to equip students with the capability for their future career development. In order to prepare electrical and mechanical (E&M) engineering graduates with the competencies they require to work in the 21 st century, a holistic and deep understanding of the development of core competencies for students working in the E&M industry is crucial because it enables the maintenance of the quality of the VET system to make it more appropriate and effective. The objective of this study was to identify the core competencies for students who will work in the E&M industry in Hong Kong and also to determine the adequacy of the programme in delivering core competencies from the students' perspective. A mixed methods research design that included a quantitative approach and a qualitative approach was applied. In this study, the quantitative design was the dominant method used. A self-report questionnaire of 35 Likert-type items was distributed to collect data from 353 students in a final year cohort of higher diploma (HD) students studying Electrical Engineering at three different campuses. The questionnaire included two sub-scales that assessed the importance of as well as the adequacy in delivering core competencies. A qualitative approach was used as a supplement to the quantitative results and included three focus group interviews of seven to nine students from the campuses of Chai Wan, Haking Wong and Tsing Yi. A Rasch rating scale model revealed that both subscales fit the model well; the reliability of the scales was good and no differential item functioning was detected by students from three different campuses. The results highlighted the importance of core competencies for students who will work in the E&M industry in the 21st century and the adequacy of the HD programme at delivering these core competencies. The findings suggested that almost all core competencies listed in the questionnaire were important and indicated that the HD programme had properly delivered most of the core competencies being explored in this study. Discussions based on these findings were conducted to determine the relationship between core competencies and adequacy in delivering the HD programme to develop short-term implications for how the programme administrator should address the core competencies and strategically deliver them to students. In the end, long-term suggestions regarding how to apply this study to improve the quality of the VET system were made.",2016,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,Ann Arbor,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Identifying core competencies for students of a Vocational Education and Training (VET) Programme in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering in Hong Kong ISBN: 9781369629149,,,,,"Career development; Data Analysis; Education, Secondary; Educational change; Educational psychology; School management and organization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TVAZTJ7G,thesis,2011,"Budhram, Stanley Chandra",An Economic Evaluation Comparing Stroke Telemedicine to Conventional Stroke Medicine,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/909949690?pq-origsite=primo,"Stroke is not only a serious medical problem, but it also poses an enormous economic burden on society. Stroke ranks the third as the leading cause of death in the United States behind heart disease and cancer. The survivors of stroke suffer from various degrees of long-term disability which create a severe financial burden on society. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) provides some of the best stroke treatment in the United States, but containing costs of conventional care without compromising access and quality of care remains a challenge. A telemedicine network between UPMC Stroke Institute (hub) and selected regional hospitals (spokes) was established to address the challenge. This cost-benefits study presents comparing telestroke treatment plan with that of conventional stroke to determine the viability of the telestroke approach. The economic evaluation was designed to inform the decision on whether or not to continue with the telestroke treatment of patients with blocked arteries from acute ischemic stroke. The group of patients selected for telestroke was treated via teleconsultation, whereas the conventional care group was treated at the stroke center. Both groups were evaluated by the same team of neurologists and received similar treatment, during the same period. Functional outcomes were obtained prospectively and were measured using the modified Rankin Scale. A Markov decision analytic model employing the Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine the cost-benefits (incremental net monetary benefits) of the two healthcare strategies. The model was constructed by using data obtained from UPMC, Pennsylvania Cost Containment Council, The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program, and the medical literature. The data was entered into the TreeAge Pro software package version 2011(TreeAge Pro Inc. of Williamstown, MA, USA), for modeling. The data was synthesized, processed, and output presented in text, numeric, and graphical form. The results showed that the telestroke treatment cost $14,336 less than that of conventional stroke. Although telestroke was found to be more effective than conventional care, the difference was not significant. Telestroke showed an incremental net monetary benefit over conventional care by $20,387 when the willingness to pay (WTP) value was set at $86,461. The WTP was based on the statistical value of life established by the EPA as $6.9 million, and an average life expectancy of 78 years. Telestroke is a viable alternative to conventional care for treating acute ischemic stroke with IVtPA, if the treatment is accomplished within three hours of the initial onset of stroke, and when a vascular neurologist is not readily available at the spoke site.

TWZBMWTE,thesis,2010,"Tejada Abreu, Alicia M.",Print media paper consumption patterns through a system dynamics approach,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/751592291?pq-origsite=primo,"As awareness of the current unsustainable state of our society increases, it has become evident that immediate action is needed to change this state. Many of the ecological changes that threaten the long-term survival of humans and of other species have anthropogenic origins. Industry’s impact and its role in mitigating these impacts is the focus of much discussion and debate. Two industries that are working to deal with these issues are the printing and paper industries. The environmental impacts associated with the entire life-cycle of paper are significant, yet the socially redeeming value of the content printed can be equally as significant. A curious paradox is that advances in information and communication technology (ICT) have long been predicted to lead to a reduction in media use, resulting in the so-called paperless office, but this has not been the case. Until recently, the observed trends worldwide demonstrate that in most countries paper consumption has been on the rise, however in some developed countries there is some suggestion that this trend may be reversing. The work of Sellen and Harper (2002) provides a qualitative explanation of why paper consumption is on the rise. Nonetheless, there is little research that develops quantitative models to explain paper consumption patterns. This thesis leverages Sellen and Harper’s qualitative models to develop a system dynamics model to explain the effects and interactions between ICT, the affordances of paper and paper-like technologies, and knowledge work flows. Specifically, the Bass Diffusion technology adoption model and the path dependence patterns of behavior are modified in an attempt to reproduce the paper consumption patterns observed in the United States (US). Sensitivity analysis through the use of a fractional factorial experiment has been performed to identify the most influential model parameters to set the model parameters at values that best represent US data. An assessment of the system dynamic model’s utility based on a publically available quantitative study of the amount of original information that is produced and stored each year is also presented in this study.

U2KI6RA6,thesis,2021,"Lee, Yin Jin; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Sustainable agri-food supply chains: consumer demand and company sourcing practices,,,,,,"Agri-food supply chains link food production to processing, trading, distribution, and consumption across the globe. However, food production can have severe environmental and social impacts. Rising societal awareness of issues regarding supply chain sustainability both promises opportunities for and assigns responsibilities to companies involved in the supply chain. Companies may seek to win new customers by selling certified sustainable goods. They may also implement other sustainable sourcing practices (SSPs) besides certification to manage their suppliers' sustainability performance. This dissertation presents three studies that address some knowledge gaps about consumer demand for certified sustainable products and companies' sustainable sourcing practices, with new findings drawn from large-scale, real-world datasets. While survey-based research indicates that consumer demand for certified sustainable goods is large, this is not reflected in actual market demand. This gap suggests that either the demand predictions were incorrect, or that the marketing strategies used in the real world failed to tap into the potential demand. The first and second studies of this dissertation (Chapter 2 and 3) evaluate different marketing strategies by examining the actual market demand for certified Fair Trade and organic coffee based on consumer purchases at grocery stores across the US. Both studies use discrete choice models with random coefficients to characterize consumer demand in terms of consumers' willingness-to-pay, price sensitivity, and substitution behavior. The first study compares the demand for Fair Trade, organic, and dual-label Fair Trade and organic coffees, focusing on consumers who bought some certified coffee (9.3% of all coffee consumers). In aggregate, consumers (i) preferred products that were both Fair Trade and organic to products that were only Fair Trade or only organic, and (ii) showed equal preference between single-label Fair Trade and organic products. The results encourage companies that are choosing between the labels to invest in both Fair Trade and organic labels instead of just one. The second study compares consumer demand for premium-priced and regular-priced Fair Trade and organic coffees relative to conventional (unlabeled) coffee. The study found that consumers were more sensitive to the prices of both premium and regular certified coffee than to the prices of their conventional counterparts. Even consumers who spent most of their coffee budget on premium certified coffees were more likely to choose the regular conventional category over the regular certified category in response to an increase in the price of their preferred premium certified coffee. Companies making and selling certified products would need to do more than matching prices and using sustainability certification labels to increase their market competitiveness in a traditional retail setting dominated by conventional products. Companies want to know what SSPs other companies are using to inform their own strategies. Stakeholders, such as governments and non-profit organizations, need to know the prevalence of different SSPs used by companies in multiple supply chain stages to understand the development of sustainable supply chain in an industry. The third study (Chapter 4) addresses these knowledge gaps by examining the mixes of SSPs used by 171 companies in the palm oil industry. The study determined how ""hands-on"" or ""hands-off"" the companies are, and how the companies' SSPs depend on their supply chain stages--retailers, manufacturers, or processors and traders (PTs). Hypotheses about the relationship between companies' SSPs and their supply chain stages were based on theories commonly applied in sustainable supply chain management. Regression analysis was applied to data on companies' SSPs collected from their websites and reports in 2018. The two most popular practices were certification and supplier code of conduct. On average, companies used two hands-off practices regardless of supply chain stage. In contrast, companies used fewer hands-on practices on average the more downstream their supply chain stage was, decreasing from PTs, to manufacturers, and then to retailers. The variations agree with what is expected from theory. The results highlight the prevalence of hands-off practices and that the PTs likely lack hands-on support from their downstream customers. Stakeholders are recommended to collaborate and invent solutions that can provide more support to PTs and more upstream suppliers.",2021,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,Sustainable agri-food supply chains,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Sustainable agri-food supply chains : consumer demand and company sourcing practices ISBN: 9781396943676,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
U5XUL4B9,thesis,2015,"Zhang, Biao; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Decision analysis of novel point-of-care diagnostics for Pediatric Pneumonia: implementation in Developing countries with tiered healthcare systems,,,,,,"Pediatric Pneumonia (PNA) is the single leading cause of death in children under five, accounting for 19% of all childhood deaths worldwide. Due to severe resource constraints on healthcare, the global burden of the disease in children is disproportionately shared by developing countries. In particular, India, having the highest incidence rate of PNA, accounts for more than 30% of the world's neonatal deaths from pneumonia every year. The three-tier referral systems, shared by many other developing countries, has introduced inefficiencies into delivering appropriate healthcare to patients in need. Point-of-care (POC) diagnostics is a type of tool used to assist physicians to make clinical decisions. Its key advantage include the quick turnaround of results, low cost and high diagnostic power could potentially improve India's pressing situation due to pneumonia. Since the disease progresses quickly in infants and babies and transportation of patients within the healthcare system is time consuming, POC diagnostic is crucial in lowering both the mortality of children with pneumonia and the cost of treating PNA. To this effect, we investigate the potential impact of POC diagnostics when implemented in a three-tier referral system. Using India as a case country, I construct a decision tree model that evaluates cost, mortality, and the combined cost-effectiveness in Tree-Age software as a framework which evaluates five implementation strategies of a POC diagnostic for PNA within the Indian public healthcare system. The strategies reflect various prescription decisions and referral patterns in current medical practice in India. I concluded that (1) the diagnostic will result in both higher cost and mortality in areas where the practice is to provide all patients antibiotics and thus not recommended, (2) the diagnostic is very likely to achieve lower cost and mortality when patients do not always receive antibiotics and sometimes are given only symptom-relieving drugs and thus recommended, (3) the diagnostic has great potential in generating savings by limiting patients from being transported to urban hospitals, (4) when dual diagnostic is employed combining POC diagnostics and X-ray, confirming positive cases from the diagnostic by X-ray results in lower cost and confirming negative cases results in lower mortality and (5) the diagnostic can save resources and benefit health outcomes and should be implemented in places where X-ray is not available.",2015,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,Decision analysis of novel point-of-care diagnostics for Pediatric Pneumonia,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Decision analysis of novel point-of-care diagnostics for Pediatric Pneumonia : implementation in Developing countries with tiered healthcare systems,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
U6F4X7LJ,thesis,2015,"Sakhrani, Vivek A.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",Negotiated collaboration: a study in flexible infrastructure design,,,,,,"This thesis frames design in infrastructure public-private partnerships (P3s) as an exercise in negotiated collaboration. I investigate whether the collaborative design process in P3s can systematically deliver the benefits of innovation in design. The focus is on two aspects of the design process: project co-design, and collaboration mechanism. I find that both aspects enable innovation by driving project actors to learn about the design space and develop a shared understanding of the design problem. Learning through shared understanding not only improves quantifiable payoffs (Objective Value) but also enhances the actors' psycho-social outcomes (Subjective Value). Co-design is a process in which project actors simultaneously design technical and contractual features of a project. I developed a tradespace model to visualize and explore value trade-offs from co-design, using a desalination P3 as a project case. Co-design is a fundamental improvement over the traditional sequential design process because it reveals the zone of negotiated agreement, a frontier set of designs available to project actors, that can help them meet their own objectives while balancing value trade-offs. The combination of flexible modular designs and risk sharing revenue guarantee mechanisms emerged as a frontier design choice in the co-design analysis. Communication and common knowledge are two different collaboration mechanisms that affect the design choices of project actors. A controlled design experiment with 112 experienced designers tested the relative effects of these two mechanisms. The role-playing designers negotiated design decisions for a desalination P3 using the co-design tradespace model. Only the communication mechanism systematically shifted outcomes. To increase the reliability of meeting uncertain water demand, the firm traded away an expected net present value profit share of 24% (p<0.001) on average, subject to the parameter assumptions. The water authority increased contractual payments by an expected net present value share of 6.6% (p<0.001) on average. Final designs in the exercise were on average 97.5% reliable in meeting uncertain water demand. Communication dominated common knowledge as a collaboration mechanism because it enabled participants to learn about the effects of modularity and revenue guarantees on counter-party outcomes and use these design features to negotiate value trade-offs. Objective Value represents the technical (reliability) and economic (profits, payments) payoffs to project participants. Subjective Value on the other hand captures social psychological outcomes such as the degree of trust and rapport between collaborators and perceived fairness and legitimacy of the process, which are important for the partnering relationship. Participants in the collaboration experiment overwhelmingly reported high Subjective Value scores, which are positively correlated with both their improved understanding of the project's design objectives (r = 0.37, p = 0.41, p<0.001) and their ability to communicate with collaborators to agree on design choices (r = 0.36, p = 0.36, p = 0.001). This work directly addresses the literature on infrastructure public-private partnerships and shows how negotiated collaboration can create objective as well as psychosocial benefits for a stronger partnering relationship. The co-design approach speaks to the literature on systems design to emphasize how a systems view can help designers balance trade-offs. The experimental study is a methodological contribution to both the design and negotiations literature, applying the Subjective Value framework in an integrated design setting.",2015,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,Negotiated collaboration,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: Negotiated collaboration : a study in flexible infrastructure design,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Private sector participation in electrification is essential to meeting electricity access targets. Policy makers have acknowledged that grid extension in many remote rural areas is not as cost effective as decentralized alternatives such as microgrids. Microgrid companies have been unable to scale beyond pilot projects due in part to challenges in raising capital for a business model that is perceived to be risky. This thesis aims to identify and quantify the primary sources of investment risk in microgrid utilities and study ways to mitigate these risks to make these businesses more viable. Two modeling tools have been developed to this end. The Stochastic Techno-Economic Microgrid Model (STEMM) models the technical and financial performance of microgrid utilities using uncertain and dynamic inputs to permit explicit modeling of financial risk. This model is applied in an investment risk assessment and case study in Rwanda. Key findings suggest that the most important drivers of risk are fuel prices, foreign exchange rates, demand for electricity, and price elasticity of demand for electricity. The relative importance of these factors is technology dependent with demand uncertainty figuring stronger for solar and high solar penetration hybrid systems and fuel prices driving risk in diesel power and low solar penetration hybrid systems. Considering uncertainty in system sizing presents a tradeoff whereby a decrease in expected equity return decreases downside risk. High solar penetration systems are also found to be more attractive to lenders. The second modeling tool leverages electricity consumption and demographic data from four microgrids in Tanzania to forecast demand for electricity in newly electrified communities. Using statistical learning techniques, improvements in prediction performance was achieved over the historical mean baseline. I have also identified important predictors in estimating electricity consumption of newly connected customers. These include tariff structures and prices, preconnection sources of electricity and lighting, levels of spending on electricity services and airtime, and pre-connection appliance ownership. Prior exposure to electricity, disposable income, and price are dominant factors in estimating demand.",5/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Microgrid Utilities for Rural Electrification in East Africa,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720584.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
U9ECYFSD,thesis,2015,"Ellman, Douglas; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",The reference electrification model: a computer model for planning rural electricity access,,,,,,"Despite efforts from governments and other organizations, hundreds of millions of people-primarily in Africa and South Asia-still have no electricity service. Electrification efforts have historically been focused on extension of the main electric grid, but technology developments have made off-grid power systems, such as microgrids and home systems, viable alternatives for some areas. Especially since rural electrification typically depends on limited subsidies, if universal electrification is to be achieved in a timely manner, smart planning is essential to ensure that resources are directed towards cost-efficient technical solutions. Since the areas requiring electrification are expansive, the technology choices are many, and experience with off-grid systems is limited, planners struggle to evaluate tradeoffs between technology choices and estimate project costs. This thesis demonstrates that computer models that can automatically produce cost-efficient designs to the individual customer level can provide significant value to the planning process. The development of such a model by the author and collaborators at MIT and Comillas University, called the Reference Electrification Model (REM), is described. REM uses a series of heuristics to process input data, identify areas better suited for on-grid or off-grid electrification, and produce technical designs for recommended grid-extension and off-grid projects. In addition to the current state of REM, the rationale for model design choices and recommendations for future developments are described. The process and results of a pilot application of REM to Vaishali District, in Bihar, India are also described. REM will only be useful if it is actually incorporated into planning processes. In this spirit, concepts for how models like REM can benefit the regulation of rural electrification are presented, with a focus on India.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,The reference electrification model,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: The reference electrification model : a computer model for planning rural electricity access,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Across these studies, we find that sensitivity was (1a) minimal without training or aid, (1b) people were hesitant to respond ‘bot,’ and (1c) people were prone to “myside bias,” judging personas less critically when they shared political views. We also observed (1d) sensitivity improved when a bot detection aid was provided and (1e) when users received training focused on the objectives of social bot creators: to amplify narratives to an extensive social network. When participants labeled a persona a social bot, (2) the probability of their willingness to share its content dropped dramatically. We investigated the relationships between users’ attributes and social bot detection performance and found, (3a) social media experience did not improve detection and at times impaired it; (3b) myside bias affected the sensitivity and criterion used by liberals and conservatives differently; and (3c) analytical reasoning did not improve social bot detection, nor did it mitigate observed myside bias effects, but increased them slightly.

Additionally, users’ willingness to pay for a social bot detection aid increased (5a) the more they were concerned about social bots, (5b) the greater their social media experience, (5c) the greater their sensitivity, and (5d) the higher their threshold for responding ‘bot.’ These findings demonstrate the threat posed by social bots and two interventions that may reduce them.",2023,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,5/20/25 15:37,18665456 Bytes,,,,,,Why Some are Better Than Others at Detecting Social Bots,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 18665456 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,FOS: Computer and information sciences; 160510 Public Policy; FOS: Political science; 80199 Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UANR5R92,thesis,2015,"Mennicke, Annelise Mae Shearer","Toward a new understanding of intimate partner violence: Exploring typology-, gender-, and racially-inclusive dynamics",,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1709429917?pq-origsite=primo,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is estimated to affect over 1.3 million women a year and costs society more than $5.8 billion annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003). Extensive evidence indicates that men and women perpetrate IPV at similar rates (Fiebert, 2010) and a large portion of IPV involves perpetration by both partners in a couple unit (Kessler, Molnar, Feurer, & Appelbaum, 2001). These findings have created a contentious debate among researchers about the nature of IPV and utility of gender in understanding its dynamics. Family conflict theorists contend that IPV is used as an outgrowth of conflict and that societal and family characteristics explain the high rates of IPV perpetration for men and women (Fiebert & Gonzalez, 1997, Straus, 2010). Meanwhile, feminist theorists focus on the role that control plays in understanding violence and how control intersects with gender to create a culture of terror (Stark, 2007) and contend that methodological issues account for the high prevalence of gender symmetry (Kelly & Johnson, 2008). A typology of IPV, which assumes that violence is not used in intimate relationships for one static reason, asserts that there are different categories of IPV that occur within intimate partner relationships and failure to specify the category of IPV being explored has led to confusing and uninterpretable empirical findings regarding the rates of IPV and gender (Kelly & Johnson, 2008). The purpose of this research was to bridge these theories by advancing the typology of IPV perspective using a gender and racially robust sample and identifying the correlates and consequences of each category. This research tested a theory of IPV at the relationship level, conceptualizing categories of IPV as occurring from the interaction of individual behavior within a relationship, forming 10 unique categories. An analysis of secondary data was used; the data were originally collected by Dutton, Goodman, and Schmidt (2006) to develop and validate a measure of nonviolent coercive control under a project entitled ""Development and Validation of a Coercive Control Measure for Intimate Partner Violence"", which was funded by the National Institute of Justice (Award number 2001-WT-BX-0503). The original sample consisted of 757 participants who were recruited from several locations, which was reduced to 714 participants through data cleaning procedures. Individuals completed a survey which included questions about their own perpetration of violence and control, victimization by violence and control, levels of social/relationship related constructs, mental health related outcomes, and demographic characteristics. Cluster analyses, chi-square tests of independence, multinomial logistic regressions, and multigroup path analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Cluster analyses indicated that elements of IPV (control perpetration, control victimization, violence victimization and violence perpetration) all clustered in a high/low pattern, which intersected to form six unique categories of IPV in addition to the no-IPV category. Chi-square tests of independence indicated that distributions of these categories of IPV were dependent on gender but independent of race. A multinomial logistic regression found that each category of IPV was predicted by a unique combination of demographic and social/relationship variables, and interactions between race, gender, and socioeconomic status to account for intersectionality theory were not useful in the retained model. Finally, a multigroup path analysis revealed that levels of PTSD and depression were higher for individuals in relationships with IPV than without IPV. This research provides empirical support that IPV as previously described and identified by two seemingly competing theoretical orientations exists simultaneously. Support for the FCTs perspective was found because the majority of violence that existed in relationships was bidirectional, suggesting an association with conflict. Several categories of IPV were control-related, in line with feminist theories; most notably a unique category of intimate terrorism was affirmed that could not be explained by any demographic characteristics. This research found support for all four categories of IPV identified under Johnson's (2008) typology of IPV, but also found the presence of two control-related categories: situational control and control resistance. Interpreted cautiously in lieu of the limitations of the study, this new typology of IPV provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the range of violent and controlling experiences within relationships, and gives social workers a common language to describe the variety of IPV present within their client systems which can be used to guide the development and implementation of more responsive treatment modalities.",2015,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,Toward a new understanding of intimate partner violence,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,"Book Title: Toward a new understanding of intimate partner violence: Exploring typology-, gender-, and racially-inclusive dynamics ISBN: 9781321792652",,,,,Social service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, our understanding of the degree to which scientists respond to shifts in that allocation is very limited. How does the scientific community reorganize itself and gain new entrants? How do research priorities change? What collaborative arrangements are formed with the advent of more funding? In this study malaria research is used as a setting in which to explore these critical issues. This provides a useful context not only because it is a relatively small and easily identifiable research community, but also because funding for malaria research has increased more than fourfold over the past 15 years first through a large expansion of the NIH budget and subsequently through the entry of the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. This provides a quasi-experimental setting to explore how scientific communities react to funding incentives. In particular changes in productivity of scientists, the entry of other biologists into the field of malaria, the diversity of the scientific community and individual research lines pursued, and the collaborative agreements struck, are examined here. The research methods include a bibliometric analysis of the malaria publication space and extensive interviews and discussions with malaria researchers and global health experts. The analysis suggests that when funding is scaled up rapidly, scientific output increases at diminishing returns. Publication growth was accounted for primarily by the entry of scientists into the field of malaria in the late 1990s and onwards, while individual productivity rates remained flat in the advent of more funding. Furthermore, there was a shift in research emphasis towards more applied translational research, particularly drug and vaccine development. Finally, the network of researchers and policy makers became more collaborative, but also concentrated decision making power into the hands of a small, tight-knit global health community.",2010,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,"More money, more science?",,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,"Book Title: More money, more science? : how the malaria research community responds to funding opportunities",,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The work presented in this thesis focuses on understanding the effects of policies that influence science and technology interventions, and determining the impact of science and technology interventions themselves. Chapter 1 explores how the USA PATRIOT and Bioterrorism Preparedness Acts affected scientific progress. Regulations and guidance stemming from these pieces of legislation placed restrictions on microbiological research involving certain dangerous pathogens, including B. anthracis and Ebola virus. On a macro level, results indicated that research involving virulent strains of these organisms was not inhibited by the biosecurity laws. The most striking negative effect was a loss of efficiency. Chapter 2 examines a pilot research intervention in information and communication technology for development (ICTD). Initial assessments in the field indicated that technology has the potential to be successfully implemented in an underserved community. Researchers’ experience in the field also identified the challenges and rewards of conducting field research in ICTD. Chapter 3 presents the PREval (Pilot Research Evaluation) framework, which was developed to address the specific needs and challenges of ICTD field researchers. This framework draws from established evaluation techniques and other available resources on project assessment, but offers instructions customized for ICTD pilot research interventions. Initial testing of the concept behind PREval indicated that it can be feasibly applied to a range of ICTD projects and has the potential to add value to ICTD pilot project evaluations.

The first tool integrates the economic input-output approach of life cycle assessment with environmental fate, exposure and risk assessment to estimate the spatial distribution of air toxic health risks due to sector-specific economic activity in the US. The model is used to relate the economic activity and exposure potential (population density and meteorology) associated with point source emissions of the heavy metal and carcinogen, hexavalent chromium, or Cr(VI), on a county basis. The results indicate that linking economic activity, emission estimates, and fate and transport models for air toxics can inform both life cycle impact and comparative health risk assessments, allowing us to better target emission reductions to minimize hot-spots of risk. The second tool is a framework for science-based assessment and multi-stakeholder deliberation. The framework combines attributes of existing tools for environmental assessment and management, such as multiple criteria analysis, integrated assessment, and uncertainty analysis. It consists of two parts: a DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-States-Impacts-Responses) analysis to identify the important causal relationships among anthropogenic environmental stressors, processes, and outcomes; and a Decision Landscape analysis which aims to ensure that relevant legal, institutional, and social factors affecting a decision, as well as the knowledge, values, and decision making of participants in the various elements of the DPSIR process, are recognized and considered. The framework is applied to coral reef protection and restoration in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, focusing on anthropogenic stressors, such as domestic wastewater. A structured elicitation of values and beliefs conducted at a coral reef management workshop held at Key West, Florida is used to develop information for an integrated DPSIR/Decision Landscape framework. The framework identifies key DPSIR relationships, current scientific understanding, and stakeholder perceptions, which can be used together to predict the outcomes of management options and to identify future research needed to resolve conflict among stakeholders over scientific understanding and preferred management options. The third tool is aimed at identifying where additional scientific research may be needed to support better informed decisions and resolve possible conflicts over preferred management actions. The method combines and builds on aspects of multiple stakeholder deliberation, multiple criteria analysis, Bayesian Belief Networks, and value of information analysis. The method is applied to coral reef protection and restoration in the Guánica Bay Watershed, Puerto Rico, focusing on assessing and managing anthropogenic stressors, such as sedimentation and pollution from inland sources such as sewage, agriculture, and development. Structured elicitations of values and beliefs conducted at a coral reef management workshop held at La Parguera, Puerto Rico are used to develop information for demonstrating the method. Beliefs and preferred management options are examined for whether they exhibit greater coherence between stakeholders when informed by plausible study results. The results indicate that new scientific research is likely to bring people who initially disagree to agree. However, there can be situations where prior beliefs may be too different from the study results to shift perspectives and bring people to agreement. Though preliminary these results suggest that the method can provide useful insights on the social implications of a research program.",12/1/11,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:26,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716315.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UGGF3AUN,thesis,2014,"Peña-Cabra, Ivonne Astrid",Retrospective and Prospective Analysis of Policy Incentives For Wind Power in Portugal,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Retrospective_and_Prospective_Analysis_of_Policy_Incentives_For_Wind_Power_in_Portugal/6721337/1,"Concerns over climate change impacts, goals to increase environmental sustainability, and questions about the reliability of fuel supply have led several countries to pursue the goal of increasing the share of renewable energy sources in their electricity grid. Portugal is one of the leading countries for wind electricity generation. Wind diffusion in Portugal started in the early 2000’s and in 2013 wind electricity generation accounted for more than 24% (REN 2013b). The large share of wind in Portuguese electricity production is a consequence of European Union (E.U.) mandates and national policies, mainly feed-in tariffs. Discussions on the appropriate policy design and level of incentive to promote renewable energy adoption and meet further renewable capacity goals are ongoing in Portugal, namely in what concerns the level and duration of feed-in tariffs that should be provided to independent power producers. This, in turn, raises the question of whether the past feed-in tariff levels were well designed to achieve the goals of a larger penetration of renewables in the Portuguese grid. The policies to induce wind adoption have led to a growth in wind installed capacity and share of electricity generated by wind in Portugal from less than 1% in 2000 to approximately 24% in 2013, but questions arise on their cost-effectiveness and whether alternative policy designs would have led to the same goal. vi The Portuguese wind feed-in tariffs are a guaranteed incentive which has varied between $85- $180/MWh over the last 20 years (ERSE 2011), and remained approximately constant since 2001 at $101/MWh. They are currently guaranteed for 20 years of production or 44GWh of electricity generation per MW installed (Diário da República 2013) - the longest period among countries with high wind electricity share. They do not incorporate any digression rate besides inflation, and are guaranteed for every unit of electricity fed to the grid. There are no power plants that have already been decommissioned despite being in operation for more than 20 years, favoring from new, detailed and hard-to-follow agreements in the legislation. All wind parks that are currently in operation have received feed-in tariffs since they connected to the grid, and are expected to keep receiving them at least until December 2019, and up to December 2036 - depending on year of connection and agreement under the most recent legislation (Diário da República 2013). The 2020 renewable energy goals in Portugal include having 6.8 GW of installed wind capacity, which implies the connection of 2 GW in the next years. If no further grid investments are made and wind capacity increases up to 100 MW to the connection point that we analyze, total annual electricity spill is likely to range the 20% to 40%. If the connection grid policy is designed to allow for wind spill, already ‘occupied’ connection points will be available to new entrants, lowering the total investment costs for new wind parks and increasing their profitability. This thesis is divided in three main parts: a first introductory section, a retrospective study of wind power in Portugal and a prospective analysis of the Portuguese wind power sector. The introductory section is a brief overview of the global renewable status, described in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 compile a retrospective study of wind power and the policies that have incentivized wind diffusion. We include in the discussion some references to the future wind vii power goals, but the results and policy recommendations are directed towards the existing connected wind power capacity. Chapter 2 is a qualitative piece that describes in detail the motivation behind the Portuguese wind power diffusion, the policy changes over the last 20 years and the mechanics of the remuneration mechanism, i.e. the feed-in tariff formula variables and the actors of the wind power sector. We compare the Portuguese feed-in tariff with other European feed-in tariff designs and conclude that the incentive is one of the highest in Europe, contributing to the current Portuguese electricity system deficit of about $2 billion. If feed-in tariffs keep being fixed and do not incorporate any market variation, and renewables are prioritized to meet electricity demand, feed-in tariff net support per unit of electricity might be higher when the wind blows the most because moments with high penetration of renewable power might be correlated with low market prices. We find that wind power penetration is correlated with net exports to Spain. This might result in a net cost to Portugal and a subsidy to Spanish electricity consumers per unit of electricity traded. In total terms, the resulting subsidy is higher when the wind resource is larger as well, as the total amount of electricity that is exported increases. In Chapter 3 we estimate the profits of wind power producers connected in Portugal between 1992 and 2010, and we recommend specific policy reforms that would lower spending in the form of wind feed-in tariffs. In particular, we assess four scenarios to decrease the level and/or period of the tariffs. We find that under the 2005 legislation - in which feed-in tariffs are granted for 15 years, all existing wind parks have positive NPVs varying between $0 and $12/MWh, when considering a 20-year lifetime. In fact, most of existing wind parks can stop receiving the feed-in tariff now (July 2014), and instead participate directly in the Iberian electricity market and still be profitable. Moreover, under the 2013 feed-in tariff reform that aims at decreasing the viii electricity system deficit, total spending will increase and wind parks will have larger profits than under the 2005 legislation. The motivation of keeping a high feed-in tariff comes from the need of liquidity that wind producers can provide immediately to the electricity system, which is required at this moment to comply with the E.U. economic agreements signed during the recession. Nevertheless, the environmental and energy dependency benefits of the Portuguese wind sector could have been achieved with as much as 25% less spending. Later on, we move to analyze future wind power additions. Chapter 4 compiles a prospective analysis of the wind power sector in Portugal. We focus on new wind parks that will connect to critical lines of the distribution grid in two regions of the country, as part of the national 2030 wind power goals. In particular, we assess the implications of a 100% guaranteed availability of grid power capacity. We find that from the investor perspective, it is more profitable to bear some risk of wind power curtailment, because of the avoided costs that would otherwise be incurred to upgrade the grid. We also find that since there is ample room in the distribution lines to connect more wind parks, very few grid upgrades can allow to highly increase the distributed wind capacity with a low risk of wind curtailment. Moreover, even in scenarios with ‘high curtailment’ of 5% to 20%, projects are profitable. Thus, the Portuguese government should consider a policy where the guaranteed feed-in would be removed, and further assess the possibility of limiting profitability of the existing and new wind projects by introducing curtailment. This work compiles two perspectives: first, a temporal perspective, in which past and future assessments of wind power diffusion are described. Second, a perspective on policy characterization, in which we present an assessment of two characteristics in the feed-in tariff design: the level/period of the tariff and the conditionality of prioritizing wind power over fossilix fuel resources with absence of risk of wind power curtailment. The level and period-related policy recommendations are considered for the existing wind parks, and are addressed mainly in Chapter 3. Considerations about grid capacity and introducing a risk of wind power curtailment are considered for subsequent wind power capacity additions, and are mainly considered in Chapter 4. In addition, notice that Chapter 3 focuses on avoiding excessive profitability of wind power parks while in Chapter 4 we analyze wind and grid capacity additions under the perspective of wind investors. Nevertheless, as we also find in Chapter 4 that profits are excessive, we do make recommendations that limit wind investor’s revenue. Portuguese decision maker should give serious consideration to revisions to the Portuguese feed-in tariff policy design. Most of the existing Portuguese wind parks to not need a feed-in tariff to be profitable. A value associated with the risk of wind power curtailment for subsequent additions should be incorporated in future policy design. We expect that this work will contribute to the Portuguese renewable policy in particular in light of Portugal’s 2020 and 2030 wind power goals.",8/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6721337.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UIAMY527,thesis,2021,"Smith, Erin E.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",The cost of CO2 transport and storage in global integrated assessment modeling,,,,,,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of many critical tools to mitigate global climate change. Much analytic work has been dedicated to evaluating the cost and performance of various CO2 capture technologies, but less attention has been paid to evaluating the cost of CO2 transport and storage. This paper assesses the range of CO2 transport and storage costs and evaluates their impact on economy-wide modelling results of decarbonization pathways. Many integrated assessment modeling studies assume a combined cost for CO2 transport and storage that is uniform in all regions of the world, commonly estimated at $10/tCO2. Realistically, the cost of CO2 transport and storage is not fixed at $10/tCO2 and varies across geographic, geologic, and institutional settings. I surveyed the literature to identify key sources of variability in transport and storage costs and developed a method to quantify and incorporate these elements into a cost range. I find that onshore pipeline transport and storage costs vary from $4 to 45/tCO2 depending on key sources of variability including transport distance, scale (i.e. quantity of CO2 transported and stored), monitoring assumptions, reservoir geology, and transport cost variability such as pipeline capital costs. Using the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, I examined the impact of variability in transport and storage costs by applying a range of uniform costs in all geographic regions in a future where global temperature rise is limited to 2°C. I then developed several modeling cases where transport and storage costs vary regionally. In these latter cases, global cumulative CO2 captured and stored through 2100 ranges from 290 to 377 Gt CO2, compared to 425 Gt CO2 when costs are assumed to be uniformly $10/t CO2 in all regions. I conclude that the widely used assumption of $10/tCO2 for the tran sport and storage of CO2 is reasonable in some regions, but not in others. Moreover, CCS deployment is more sensitive to transport and storage costs in some regions than others, particularly China. Several transport and storage options should be taken into account when modeling large-scale deployment of CCS in decarbonization pathways. However, cost data are scarce and there is still a significant amount of uncertainty and variability in available transport and storage costs.",2021,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: The cost of CO2 transport and storage in global integrated assessment modeling,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through a social constructivist worldview (Creswell, 2007) this case study uses a grounded multilevel mixed methods (Borner, et al., 2010) approach to determine social mechanisms of cross-disciplinary teams (CDTs) observing a National Institutes of Health-funded research network. Observations, interviews, focus groups and through the use of the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI) (Cameron and Quinn, 2006) data were collected and analyzed using qualitative coding to inform a micro/meso level of analysis between February 2010 and December 2011. Aim 1 sets out to determine social structuring mechanisms in CDTs. It searched for the dynamics that are at the core of team collaboration by focusing on descriptive elements found in team interactions on the individual, group, and network levels (Hedström & Swedberg, 1998). Aim 2 determines how social mechanisms emerge in a transdisciplinary team. As transdisciplinarity (TD) is an unlikely constant state in social systems, it may at times be a novel outcome of team science collaborations. At other times it may be dormant to lesser multi- and interdisciplinary functions embedded within group interactions (Klein, 2008). Through theoretical and emergent coding and graphical mapping of present and preferred change perceptions of those charged with crossing disciplinary and social boundaries the answer to how these mechanism emerge has been achieved. Findings show strong evidence of role and discipline perceptual differences that when analyzed separately provide differing insights into team functioning. When role and discipline were considered simultaneously, certain value-latent characteristics emerged as part of individual's self-perception of one's contribution to team functioning. Four main social mechanisms were identified: change, kinship, tension, and heritage. These contain identifiable team dynamics that serve as core evidence for specific team dynamics that support CDTs. This micro/meso analysis suggests that individual participation in team interactions can inform the structuration of individual role and disciplinary perceptions of macro level problems.",2012,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,Social Mechanisms of Team Science,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Social Mechanisms of Team Science: A Descriptive Case Study Using a Multilevel Systems Perspective Employing Reciprocating Structuration Theory ISBN: 9781267258205 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 7 Volume: 73,,,,,Boundaries; Cooperation; Kinship; Medical sciences; Participation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Congestion pricing has the potential to be part of the solution yet also raises a number of concerns about whether pricing a public good can be done in an equitable manner. Past studies suggest the policy is not inherently unfair, however, these studies are retroactive and focus on economic notions of welfare that are at odds with how we understand the role of equity in planning. This thesis seeks to move beyond retrospective fairness evaluations and investigate how one could plan for an equitable congestion pricing scheme by proposing a new framework, inspired by the method of scenario planning, to evaluate congestion pricing.  This framework will be used to examine the case of a potential congestion pricing scheme in the Boston Metropolitan Region. This study combines best practices from the field of scenario planning with spatial and statistical analysis to methodically evaluate a scheme definition and understand how subpopulations are impacted differently by charging. This thesis will also analyze the distributional impacts, making use of travel diary data and the synthetic control method, of the London Central Charging Scheme to illustrate how scheme design and policy levers can contribute to differential behavioral responses.",2022,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Estimation and optimization in online marketplaces,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this thesis, we examine the role of different recommendation schemes, spanning from interpersonal recommendations in social environment given by peers to product display recommendations in physical shopping environment given by sellers on consumers’ switching and search behavior in two distinct case studies. In the first study, we look at the effect of peer recommendations on subscriber churn in a large mobile network. We find that consumers’ propensity to churn increases with the number of friends that churn and in particular with the number of strong friends that churn. In the second study, we implement an in-vivo randomized field experiment to measure the effect of product display recommendations as book placement on shopper behavior in a physical bookstore. We leverage video tracking technologies to monitor how shoppers respond to random book placement, which induces random search costs. We find that books recommended at the edge of the table are more likely to be picked and taken than those placed at the center of the table. More interestingly, we also find that conditional on being picked, shoppers are equally likely to take books placed at the edge and at the center of the table, suggesting that display recommendations positively affect consumer choice mainly through its effect on the search process and not through its effect on the consideration process. Therefore, we empirically show that provision of recommendations, although in different schemes, may generally help to reduce consumers’ search costs in product or service discovery process, relative to what they would do without such an intervention. Moreover, we perform a comparative analysis between offline and online applications of recommender systems to systematically investigate the current practices, future prospects and policy perspectives when applying recommender systems in physical retailing. All these issues highlight opportunities for physical retailers to design, implement and evaluate their recommender systems that offer convenience benefits and appropriate protection to consumers.",5/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:26,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716402.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UQPB2CQT,thesis,2017,"Lightfoot, Shlomiya; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Multi-stakeholder contribution to biotechnology environmental assessment,,,,,,"Environmental assessments, such as those for biotechnology applications, are typically conducted by small groups of expert assessors, but scholars and practitioners are increasingly interested in involving diverse stakeholders. In addition to other reasons for broader involvement, researchers have proposed that stakeholders could substantively aid assessment by (1) contributing system knowledge; (2) applying diverse conceptual models; (3) helping available knowledge keep pace with assessment needs; and (4) contributing based on their values, as do narrow expert assessors. Hypothesizing that these types of contribution, suggested theoretically or observed in single workshops, represent key sources of stakeholder contribution across processes, this study examines contribution in several diverse participant processes: an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) workshop on testing schemes for some engineered microbes compared with another EPA office's testing requirements for other engineered microbes; an MIT-Wilson Center workshop series on synthetic biology environmental assessment research needs; and the Food and Drug Administration's engineered salmon environmental assessment along with diverse stakeholder comments and critiques. The study also identifies practical considerations for enabling multi-stakeholder contribution and applies lessons to broader societal processes. The study analyzes process documents, conversations with conveners and participants, and participant observation. It also reviews knowledge about biological processes representing important areas for assessment and research, discussing complexities of knowledge production and use for assessment. Stakeholders contributed in each of the four hypothesized ways across the cases, suggesting that diverse involvement could regularly contribute positively to assessment. Stakeholders also (5) challenged standard assessment approaches, challenges that could aid assessment as well. Practical considerations for enabling diverse participant contribution emerge from the cases: Process continuity over time; credible expectations of authority or influence in decision-making; and balance between predefined structure and flexibility and between technical tasks and enabling non-technical input may be key. Work developing approaches in these areas is needed, including on incorporating nontechnical inputs, on processes encompassing later assessment stages, on integrating diverse participant processes with governance, and on diverse involvement in other aspects of technology development and execution. Better and increased stakeholder involvement could, through substantive content and incorporation of values, enable science, technology development, and decision-making best to serve society.",2017,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2017 Ph.D.,Book Title: Multi-stakeholder contribution to biotechnology environmental assessment,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UR4T7JMZ,thesis,2014,"Behrman, Robert",Structural Measurement Of Military Organization Capability,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Structural_Measurement_Of_Military_Organization_Capability/6723242/1,"This research presents a structural model of the effect of the organization of military units upon their capability. This research is oriented towards a more complete understanding of military capability and policy decisions about the structure and development of military forces. We identify the types of national and military policy decisions that claims of military capability inform, and find that there are five distinct types of capability claims relevant to military policy. We show how these types of capability claims are logically related to each other, but have different premises, predicates, and standards of proof. We find that one of these types of claims, General Organization Capability Claims, ties together the various military policy decisions. The remainder of this research shows how these capability claims can be formally structured based on military doctrine and structurally evaluated using a network-science based model. The interaction between the structural elements of a military organization (personnel, materiel, and information) and the things it is supposed to do (military tasks) can be represented and analyzed with network science methods, and represents a type of general organization capability claim. We present a method for representing policy decisions about unit structure and tactical doctrine. We then develop two versions of a structural model of capability–one that links the individual elements of an organization to the tasks it performs; another that considers the capacity of a set of organizations to meet a set of requirements. We show that network statistics of organizations represented off of authoritative, rather than observational, data are still consistent with network science findings but require interpretation. We also show how alternate methods of aggregating organizations can expand the utility of the capability measurement. This research presents five new contributions to the fields of military policy analysis and network science–(1) a taxonomy of military capability claims, (2) a meta-network model of doctrinal organization and task data, (3) a structural model of organization capability, (4) a structural model of organization capacity, and (5) a network-based method integer programming method.",5/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723242.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
URSCKXFA,thesis,2018,"Metzler, Florian; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems","Firms, industries, and technological change: a patent-based approach to studying disruption and disruptors",,,,,,"This thesis presents a new empirical approach as well as a new patent-based dataset for studying disruption and technology transition cases. At the core of this approach lies a novel engineering systems framework of technological change. The framework focuses on the relationship between changes in technological competencies and changes in product designs, and encompasses both firm-level and industry-level dynamics. The new framework and dataset are applied to the study of three cases of technology transition during the 1993- 2012 period. The cases include (1) disruption in the mobile phone industry with a focus on Apple, BlackBerry, and Nokia; (2) disruption in the photography industry with a focus on Fujifilm, Canon, and Kodak; and (3) technology transition in the automotive industry with a focus on Toyota, Volkswagen, and GM. The former two industries comprise widely discussed disruption cases, allowing me to demonstrate advantages of the presented approach and develop novel insights into these cases. The third case, on the automotive industry, generates complementary insights by considering an industry with products comprising more integrated product architectures. The case selection allows for cross-case comparisons to begin endogenizing industry-specific factors. The thesis' main contributions are methodological and theoretical: First, I present a new dataset - and corresponding data assembly methods - of comprehensive corporate patent portfolios. The portfolios take into account each firm's corporate family tree structure as well as acquisitions. As such, the dataset reflects the actual range of firms' codified technological activities more closely than previous efforts and enables a more accurate view on how technological change manifests in firms and industries. To connect the data to theory, I develop a set of novel metrics to operationalize semantic concepts such as technological diversification and concentration of portfolios as well as firms' technological core and growth competencies. These metrics are based on a newly developed variance measure for hierarchically structured networks. I define growth competencies as competencies that undergo rapid year-to-year growth outside of a firm's core competencies. By identifying incumbents' growth competencies from historical data before major transitions, I am able to successfully hindcast future new entrants in the cases presented. Further, I introduce the concepts of technology space and product space as mappings of compositions of technological competencies and of technological competencies required by compositions of products. Second, the thesis makes theoretical contributions to resource-based view (RBV) and disruption literatures. Specifically, it presents a dynamic extension to the RBV, endogenizing technological change as well as firm-industry interconnections with regard to the emergence of technology convergences and the evolution of product designs. My findings suggest that a firm's relative position and movement in technology space needs to be considered separately from its position and movement in product space, i.e. its changing composition of competencies and its changing composition of products. Specifically, whereas firms' movements in product space can appear abrupt and even surprising - such as the sudden entry into new markets - my analysis shows that changes in technology space tend to be slower, more continuous, and more predictable. I find that in disruption cases such as with Apple's sudden ""entry"" into the mobile phone industry, the new framework reveals that it was in fact the mobile phone industry that gradually ""entered"" Apple's position in technology space - as the technological requirements of phone industry products became more and more similar to Apple's preexisting, and highly stable, competencies. Moreover, I extend the concept of technology-product connections, as put forth statically by RBV theorists, by adding a time-dependent dimension. I argue that incumbent failure - such as Nokia's and Kodak's - can be explained by incumbents' inability to diagnose and respond to the gradual weakening of their technology-product connections; in other words, by neglecting to either adjust their technological competencies or to adjust their product offerings in response to technological change. In turn, a firm with greater awareness of its own composition of technological competencies relative to its competitors as well as the changing technological requirements of prevalent product designs can deliberately incorporate such insights into strategic decision-making. In the empirical cases, I observe the ability to sense dynamics in technology and product spaces relative to the firm, and the ability to time the firm's actions accordingly, to be more present in some firms than in others. I term the existence of such abilities timing and sensing capabilities and propose them to be a concrete and operationalizable subset of Dynamic Capabilities.",2018,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,"Firms, industries, and technological change",,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2019 Ph.D.,"Book Title: Firms, industries, and technological change : a patent-based approach to studying disruption and disruptors",,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
USNSMX34,journalArticle,2023,"Smillie, Sean",Challenges at the Interface of the Natural Gas and Electric Systems,,,,10.1184/R1/24104076.V1,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Challenges_at_the_Interface_of_the_Natural_Gas_and_Electric_Systems/24104076/1,"In the United States, natural gas consumption has grown significantly in recent years, growing by 39% from 2008 to 32 EJ in 2022. This dissertation contributes to understanding key challenges arising from this growth. One challenge is the increasing interdependence between the natural gas and electric systems, which presents a growing reliability risk. Most previous analyses focus on the increasing dependence of the electric system to gas deliveries, as natural gas’ share of electric generation increased from 21% in 2008 to 38% in 2021. The reverse dependence, where some compressor stations spaced every 50-100 miles along gas transmission lines rely on the electric grid, had not been rigorously examined. To determine the exposure of the natural gas interstate pipeline system to electric outages, I identify electrically-driven compressor stations in the US, finding that 10% depend on grid electricity. Using pipeline hydraulic models, I demonstrate that the consequence of disrupting power to a single compressor station can be downstream gas shortages to more than 2 GW of downstream gas-powered electric generators. I find that historical events show this is not just a theoretical possibility. In northern Florida I show that such an outage can be larger than the most severe single-cause failure currently considered in electric reliability planning. Electric utilities should incorporate the identified facilities into critical facility lists. Establishing a federal gas reliability organization could improve gas reliability by establishing appropriate reliability reporting, incident investigation, and minimum industry standards. Second, fuel switching from coal to natural gas in the US electric sector has contributed to recent modest decreases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a strategy which proponents of liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals argue their projects would replicate elsewhere. To test this assertion, I conduct a consequential lifecycle analysis (LCA) of GHG emissions from North American LNG export projects, including the change in global natural gas and coal use resulting from the market effects of increased LNG trade. For a 2.1 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd) LNG export facility, I estimate a change in global GHG emissions of -39 to +11 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e (90% range) with a median value of -8 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e. Reductions in emissions are more moderate and less certain than suggested by previous methods, which find a median value of -36 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e for this size project. The more modest reduction is due to estimates of higher domestic coal use and a smaller decrease in international coal use than assumed by previous methods. To accurately estimate the global net change in greenhouse gas emissions from LNG terminals, project regulators and policymakers must account for market effects. Third, more than half of US households use natural gas to heat their homes, which accounts for 7% of US GHGs. Electrification using heat pumps is often seen as the most promising method of decarbonizing this energy service. However, fully electrifying building heat is challenging, as it would significantly increase peak electric loads during cold weather. I evaluate the potential for hybrid heat pumps to cost-effectively decarbonize space heating while avoiding costly peak electric generation capacity costs. Hybrid heat pumps use an electric heat pump to satisfy the majority of annual heat demands but switches to a fueled heating source like a gas furnace during peak demand. I find that avoided electric generation capacity costs justify hybrid heat pump installations in colder northern regions, but not in southern regions. In northern regions, the avoided cost is approximately $2500 per dwelling, which is sufficient to justify the additional installation costs of a hybrid system compared to their all-electric heat pump alternative. In addition, the consumption of natural gas required for hybrid systems is small, less than 300 PJ in all scenarios. This is within estimates of renewable natural gas supply capacity found in the literature.",2023,5/20/25 15:33,5/20/25 15:33,5/20/25 15:33,5852703 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Copyright,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 5852703 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Public Policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What explains this lack of doula utilization? Methods:This research employed the mental models approach, an in-depth interviewing and analysis method deriving from decision science, to examine the decision making process of expectant mothers with regard to the use of doulas. The process included 5 interviews with experts including OBGYNs, midwifes, and doulas,and 11 interviews with pregnant women.Analysis:A gap analysis compares the mental models of experts versus pregnant women.Results:Pregnant women have difficulty predicting what labor will be like, and thus how much continuous labor support they will need and want(a hot cold empathy gap). They also lack essential knowledge about what a doula is and does. They report not receiving information about doulas from their health care providers, which contributes to this gap in knowledge and is interpreted as a signal that the provider does not support the choice to use a doula. Lastly, pregnant women anticipate potentially negative relationship consequences when they imagine using a doula—both with their health care provider as well as with their partner. Conclusions/Implications: Health care providers can provide preliminary information about doulas to their patients via methods such as a poster or pamphlet. This would not only give pregnant women basic information on the benefits of doulas but also signal that they support the decision. Doula communications can better address women’s knowledge needs and relationship fears by including information about their role in supporting both women and partners in the child birth experience.",2/28/19,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:52,5/20/25 15:26,,,,,,,Doula Decisions,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7786595.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/8FAAZM2P/McDonald - 2019 - Doula Decisions A Mental Models Approach to UnderstandingLack of Doula Use Despite the Benefits.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To avoid causing harmful interference (i.e., interference causing disruptions in services), transmit power of a secondary device is dynamically adjusted. Various novel sharing mechanisms are proposed for two different types of primary system: cellular systems, and rotating radars. Both cases when primary and secondary systems cooperate (cooperative sharing), and when they do not (coexistent sharing) are considered. Based on analyses and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, this dissertation shows that useful secondary transmissions are possible even when the shared spectrum is considered 100% utilized by the primary system under conventional approaches to spectrum management. For example, in spectrum sharing with cellular systems, even when the primary system is 100% utilized, a modest extent of transmissions of around 0.01–0.03 bps/Hz is achievable for secondary transmitter and receiver that are 400 m apart. In spectrum sharing with radars, even in the scenario where radars are the most densely packed, a secondary transmitter can get almost 1.2 bps/Hz on average, when 5% of the transmitters are competing for the shared spectrum. This dissertation also shows the potential of sharing models in which a secondary system has information about a primary system, but does not cooperate in real time; such arrangements are not typically considered today. For sharing with radars, the case in which an OFDMA-based cellular system operates as the secondary spectrum-user in non-contiguous cells is considered, as might occur with a broadband hotspot service, or a cellular system using shared spectrum to supplement its dedicated spectrum. It is found that even with fluctuations and interruptions in secondary transmissions while radars rotate, the shared spectrum could be used efficiently for applications that generate much of the traffic on mobile Internet, including non-interactive video on demand, peer-to-peer file sharing, large file transfers, and web browsing, but not for applications such as real-time transfers of small files, and VoIP. For sharing with cellular systems, the efficiency of cooperative and coexistent sharing is compared based on performance of the secondary system measured as achievable transmissions, and performance of the cellular system measured as power consumption of a mobile device, which may be increased to compensate for additional interference from secondary transmissions. When both achievable secondary transmissions and primary power consumption are of concern, coexistent sharing is found to be as effective as cooperative sharing.",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6718853.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UY3ZC4J9,thesis,2016,"Yang, Xi",An integrated data access system for big computing,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1834059205?pq-origsite=primo,"Big data has entered every corner of the fields of science and engineering and becomes a part of human society. Scientific research and commercial practice are increasingly depending on the combined power of high-performance computing (HPC) and high-performance data analytics. Due to its importance, several commercial computing environments have been developed in recent years to support big data applications. MapReduce is a popular mainstream paradigm for large-scale data analytics. MapReduce-based data analytic tools commonly rely on underlying MapReduce file systems (MRFS), such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), to manage massive amounts of data. In the same time, conventional scientific applications usually run on HPC environments, such as Message Passing Interface (MPI), and their data are kept in parallel file systems (PFS), such as Lustre and GPFS, for high-speed computing and data consistency. As scientific applications become data intensive and big data applications become computing hungry, there is a surging interest and need to integrate HPC power and data processing power to support HPC on big data, the so-called big computing. A fundamental issue of big computing is the integration of data management and interoperability between the conventional HPC ecosystem and the newly emerged data processing/analytic ecosystem. However, data sharing between PFS and MRFS is limited currently, due to semantics mismatches, lacking communication middleware, and the diverged design philosophies and goals, etc. Also, challenges also exist in cross-platform task scheduling and parallelism. At the application layer, the data model mismatch between the raw data kept on file systems and the data management software of an application impedes cross-platform data processing as well. To support cross-platform integration, we propose and develop the Integrated Data Access System (IDAS) for big computing. IDAS extends the accessibilities of programming models and integrates the HPC environment with the data processing MapReduce/Hadoop environment. Under IDAS, MPI applications and MapReduce applications can share and exchange data under PFS and MRFS transparently and efficiently. Through this sharing and exchange, MPI and MapReduce applications can collaboratively provide both high-performance computing and data processing power for a given application. IDAS achieves its goal with several steps. First, IDAS enhances MPI-IO so that MPI-based applications can access data stored in HDFS efficiently. Here the term efficient means that HDFS is enhanced to support MPI-based applications. For instance, we have enhanced HDFS to transparently support N-to-1 file write for better write concurrency. Second, IDAS enhances Hadoop framework to enable MapReduce-based applications process data that resides on PFS transparently. Please notice that we have carefully chosen the term “enhance” here. That is MPI-based applications not only can access data stored on HDFS but also can continue access data stored on PFS. The same is for MapReduce-based applications. Through these enhancements, we achieve seamless data sharing. In addition, we have integrated data accessing with several application tools. In particular, we have integrated image plotting, query, and data subsetting within one application, for Earth Science data analysis. Many data centers prefer erasure-coding rather than triplication to achieve data durability, which trades data availability for lower storage cost. To this end, we have also investigated performance optimization of the erasure coded Hadoop system, to enhance Hadoop system in IDAS.",2016,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,Ann Arbor,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: An integrated data access system for big computing ISBN: 9781369287066,,,,,Computer science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decisions of interest include those around data sourcing, sampling, clustering, temporal magnification, algorithm selection, testing approach, evaluation metrics, and others. Models of the forecasting process and analysis methods are formulated in terms of a three-tier decision taxonomy, by which decision effects are exposed through systematic enumeration of the techniques resulting from those decisions. A computation platform based on the models is implemented to compute and visualize the effects. The methods and computation platform are first demonstrated by applying them to 3,003 benchmark datasets to investigate various decisions, including those that could impact the relationship between data entropy and forecastability. Then, they are used to study over 10,624 week-ahead and day-ahead residential electricity demand forecasting techniques, utilizing fine-resolution electricity usage data collected over 18 months on groups of 782 and 223 households by real smart electric grids in Ireland and Australia, respectively. The main finding from this research is that forecasting performance is highly sensitive to the interaction effects of many decisions. Sampling is found to be an especially effective data strategy, clustering not so, temporal magnification mixed. Other relationships between certain decisions and performance are surfaced, too. While these findings are empirical and specific to one practically scoped investigation, they are potentially generalizable, with implications for residential electricity demand estimation, smart electric grid design, and electricity policy.",5/1/17,5/20/25 17:34,5/20/25 17:34,5/20/25 17:34,,,,,,,Evaluating Forecasting Performance in the Context of Process-Level Decisions,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6716474.v1,,"/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/MRQ6FJ6Y/Huntsinger - 2017 - Evaluating Forecasting Performance in the Context of Process-Level Decisions Methods, Computation P.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With anticipated increases in population and associated waste generation, timely and effective waste management highlights one of the most critical challenges of sustainable development, which calls for meeting ""the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"" (WCED, 1987). Waste management in urban areas plays a particularly important role, given that waste generated from urban areas are often exported out of the region for processing and treatment, and the impacts of waste disposal activities may pass on to the other jurisdictions, and even to the next generations. An urban system cannot be sustainable if it requires more resources than it can produce on its own and generates more wastes than the environment can assimilate. The current waste management practice, which focuses on short-term impacts and end-of-pipe solutions, is reactive in nature and inadequate to promote sustainability within urban systems, across jurisdictions, and across generations. Through material flows in and out of urban systems, many potential opportunities exist to reduce waste generation and to minimize the negative impacts on the environment, the economy, and the society. City planners' involvement in waste management, however, has been largely limited to siting waste management facilities. Linking waste management with three important lenses in planning - economic development, land use, and environmental planning, this study investigates the impacts of urban growth on waste management activities, the need of transforming the reactive nature of current waste management, and the challenges and opportunities for planners to promote urban systems' self-reliance of material and waste management needs. This study includes three empirical analyses to complement theoretical discussions. First, it connects waste statistics with demographic data, geographic characteristics, and policy instruments at the county level to examine whether waste volume can be decoupled from urban population growth. Second, it examines the life cycle costs of different waste management options and develops a simulation study to seek cost-effective strategies for long-term waste management. Third, it compiles evidence of geographic-specific characteristics related to waste management and demonstrates why waste management policies cannot be one-size-fit-all. This study finds that, with successful implementation of strategic policy design, waste generation and its associated impacts can be decoupled from population and urban growth. Good lessons about waste reduction programs can be learned from different communities. Meanwhile, this study also reveals various challenges facing communities with heterogeneous characteristics, such as housing density, building age, and income. Accordingly, this study discusses the potential opportunities for planners to contribute to community-specific waste management programs, the prospect of transforming waste management practice from a cost burden to a long-term economic development strategy, and the need to incorporate waste management into the sustainable urban planning agenda.",2011,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,Challenges of sustainable urban planning,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,Ann Arbor,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Challenges of sustainable urban planning: The case of municipal solid waste management ISBN: 9781267738783 ISSN: 0419-4209 Issue: 3 Volume: 74,,,,,Cities and towns; City planning; Economic development; Management; Metropolitan areas; Political planning; Public policy; Sustainable development; Urban renewal; Urbanization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the roles of learning and knowledge transfer in a multi-product production setting are not well understood. Production and operations management literature suggests production of a variety of products is largely harmful, yet the organizational learning literature suggests there may be benefits to heterogeneity. This work explores the significance of a multi-product environment on organizational learning and knowledge transfer by studying a US-owned overseas manufacturing facility that is a leading producer of high technology hardware components. The firm produces 5 generations of high-volume focus products as well as a collection of non-focus products [an assortment of small volume products related to the focus products]. We draw on 10 years of firm archival data and qualitative data collected to shed insights into how different levels of product mix (5 generations of a focus product, thousands of minor variations on products to meet customer specifications, and an assortment of small volume products related to the focus product) impact organizational learning differently and why knowledge transfers across some products and not others by examining the role that processes play in these product transitions. Our results reconcile differences between the organizational learning and production and operations management literatures by finding support for both advantages and disadvantages to product mix on the production line depending on the extent of product differences. We find that short-term productivity improves with bounded diversity – specifically, when multiple generations of the same product are produced in the same facility. This positive impact on productivity of having multiple generations of the same product on the line may in part be explained by the firm’s ability to successfully transfer knowledge from older to newer generations of the product, improving long-term productivity, though we find benefits for focus product heterogeneity over and above the benefits from knowledge transfer. In contrast, we find short-term productivity is decreased when the production line is faced with variety across products that are too different from each other (e.g. different form factors) and across minor product variations (i.e. customer-specific product variations).",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Benefits of Bounded Diversity,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714977.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VCYNF4NU,thesis,2011,"Smithwick-Rodriguez, Tracie",A Study of College Readiness Programs among High School Students in South Texas,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/914225380?pq-origsite=primo,"Low-income high school graduates are less likely to get to a postsecondary institution than their middle and upper-income peers (U.S. Department of Education, 2000). Students who do enter a four-year institution do not have the necessary academic preparation to succeed and obtain a professional degree. The study examined how two national college awareness process programs differ in college preparation of Texas high school students among student characteristics (gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status). The college readiness initiatives, ""Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs"" (GEAR UP) and the ""Early College High School"" initiative (ECHS) were designed to provide educational services to low-income student populations through communities to help create new and/or expanded plans that strengthen schools in preparing high school students for college-level work and pursuit. The study relied on the ""Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills"" (TAKS) to analyze academic performance, commended performance, and college readiness performance data to measure outcomes of student performance from each of the two programs. Each participating school was required to implement the programs with emphasis on three overarching areas of emphasis: (a) nurturing environment that supports college awareness, which was supported by the Developmental Assets Theory, (Search Institute, 2007); (b) provide college awareness information and educational opportunities consistently, which was supported by Resiliency Theory (Goldstein, 2006); and (c) engaged learning that enhances instruction through professional development for teachers, which was supported through the Experiential Learning Theory (Kolb. 1999). Data were based on TAKS students' testing scores from two South Texas high schools. One high school utilized the GEAR UP program and one high school used the ECHS program. TAKS test scores and student characteristics were provided by the independent school district in which the high schools operate. Students were from the 2010 graduating cohort. Test scores from English Language Arts and Mathematics were compared indicators for college readiness. Data were analyzed with descriptive, two-way ANOVA, t-test, and chi-square statistics. Results indicated that students who were involved in the ECHS college readiness program outperformed students in the GEAR UP program. There was statistical significance between scores as students in the ECHS program had higher scores than those in the GEAR UP program in academic performance and commended performance. Although there was not a statistical difference in college readiness, ECHS had higher scores. Ethnicity and socioeconomic status did not have a significant effect on college readiness achievement. Gender was the only student characteristic that had a statistically difference in college readiness performance. Overall, the ECHS program provided an environment more conducive to student performance for college preparation than GEAR UP. Results indicated that environmental implementations and structures contributed to student performance. The focus or the ECHS program had strong literacy components with structured support services and implementations that enhanced instructional components. The ECHS program appeared to exhibit the strongest instructional environment supportive of Developmental Assets Theory, (Search Institute, 2007), Resiliency Theory (Goldstein, 2006), and Experiential Learning Theory (Kolb, 1999). Future research should expand the study in several areas. The study can be conducted in other areas of the state to see if there are comparable results. Another study could investigate whether statistically significant differences exist among GEAR UP, ECHS, and non-college readiness initiatives to understand what impact a college preparation program may have with non-college readiness programs. An investigation could examine the correlation between testing results to help identify whether one type of test topic impacted another. For example, if higher scores in English Language Arts led to higher scores in other subject areas, then school districts could re-focus both curricular and pedagogical strategies. The study examined how well two national college readiness initiatives prepare Texas high school students for college among student characteristics with necessary implementations from both programs. The study provided insight on how students with varied characteristics and backgrounds experience academic preparations and college readiness. The study was a comprehensive review of instructional experiences and outcomes that lead to academic and college readiness performances. The literature informed and guided the study with themes drawn by the research to reflect previous studies that related to the academic experiences of students and college readiness. All students deserve an opportunity to seek a postsecondary education yet must be academically prepared to be successful in seeking a college degree. An increase in college attainment is a necessity for the State of Texas and will contribute to a stronger economic society.

VDDN7VYW,thesis,2015,"Stein, Beth R.",Applications of Imaging Spectroscopy in Forest Ecosystems at Multiple Scales,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1946183023?pq-origsite=primo,"Forests provide a number of ecosystem services which sustain and enrich the wildlife, human societies, and the environment. However, many disturbances threaten forest ecosystems, making it necessary to monitor their health for optimal management and conservation. Although there are many indicators of forest health, changes in biogeochemical cycling, loss of species diversity, and invasive plants are particularly useful due to their vulnerability to the effects of climate change and intensive agricultural land use. Thus, this work evaluates the use of imaging spectroscopy to monitor forest nutrient status, species diversity, and plant invasions in the Mid-Atlantic region. The research is divided into four separate studies, each of which evaluated a unique application for imaging spectroscopy data at a different scale within the forest. The first two studies examined loblolly pine nutrient status at the leaf and canopy scales, respectively. The first study determined that loblolly pine foliar macronutrient concentrations can be successfully modeled across the Southeastern US (R2=0.39-0.74). Following on these results, the second study focused on the relationship between physical characteristics, reflectance, and nutrients. Reflectance values and W scattering coefficients produced successful nitrogen models across loblolly pine plots at the canopy scale. Regression models showed similar explanatory power for nitrogen, although W scattering coefficients were significantly correlated with nitrogen at multiple wavelengths and reflectance variables were not. However, the direction of some of the correlations with W and the unusually high directional area scattering factor values indicate a need for further experimentation. The third study found that several imaging spectroscopy algorithms were moderately successful in identifying wavyleaf basketgrass invasions in mixed deciduous forests (overall accuracy=0.35-0.78; kappa=0.41-0.53). Lastly, the fourth study used a novel imaging spectroscopy/lidar fusion to identify canopy gaps and measure species diversity of understory vegetation. The lidar algorithm identified 29 of 34 canopy gaps, and regression models explained 49 percent of the variance in gap species diversity. In conclusion, imaging spectroscopy can be used to evaluate ecosystem health through forest nutrient status, nitrogen models, species diversity estimates, and identification of invasive plant species.",2015,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Applications of Imaging Spectroscopy in Forest Ecosystems at Multiple Scales ISBN: 9780355211146,,,,,Remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this thesis I quantify the cost of variability of different renewable energy technologies and then explore the use of reconfigurable distribution grids and pumped hydro electricity storage to integrate renewable energy into the electricity grid. Cost of Variability I calculate the cost of variability of solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, and wind by summing the costs of ancillary services and the energy required to compensate for variability and intermittency. I also calculate the cost of variability per unit of displaced CO2 emissions. The costs of variability are dependent on technology type. Variability cost for solar PV is $8-11/MWh, for solar thermal it is $5/MWh, and for wind it is around $4/MWh. Variability adds ~$15/tonne CO2 to the cost of abatement for solar thermal power, $25 for wind, and $33-$40 for PV. Distribution Grid Reconfiguration A reconfigurable network can change its topology by opening and closing switches on power lines. I show that reconfiguration allows a grid operator to reduce operational losses as well as accept more intermittent renewable generation than a static configuration can. Net present value analysis of automated switch technology shows that the return on investment is negative for this test network when considering loss reduction, but that the return is positive under certain conditions when reconfiguration is used to minimize curtailment of a renewable energy resource. Pumped Hydro Storage in Portugal Portugal is planning to build five new pumped hydro storage facilities to balance its growing wind capacity. I calculate the arbitrage potential of the storage capacity from the perspective of an independent storage owner, a thermal fleet owner, and a consumer-oriented storage owner. This research quantifies the effect storage ownership has on CO2 emissions, consumer electricity expenditure, and thermal generator profits. I find that in the Portuguese electricity market, an independent storage owner could not recoup its investment in storage using arbitrage only, but a thermal fleet owner or consumer-oriented owner may get a positive return on investment",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Integrating Variable Renewables into the Electric Grid,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720257.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VMJD426M,thesis,2020,"Miotti, Marco; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Variability in the emissions savings potential of battery electric vehicles across regions and individuals,,,,,,"Personal vehicles account for almost 25% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and this share is increasing. The increase is due to several factors, including a growth in transportation demand and the decarbonization of electricity by 30% since 2007. Alternative technologies for road vehicles, such as battery electric, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell powertrains have the potential to achieve significant emission reductions. Yet questions remain about the emissions and costs of these alternative technologies. This thesis evaluates the emissions reduction potential of vehicles with electrified powertrains, focusing on battery electric vehicles (BEVs). It evaluates this potential taking into account heterogeneous regional conditions and consumer behavior. Consumers help determine vehicle fleet emissions through their purchasing and driving decisions, which are guided in part by the costs of different options. Therefore, the costs of ownership of BEVs in comparison to conventional vehicles inform the emissions reduction potential of BEVs. Here, we measure the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and costs of ownership of BEVs across different vehicle models as a function of travel patterns, driving styles, and properties of the natural, built, and institutional environment. We compare these costs and emissions to gasoline combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), and then ask whether and under which condition electric vehicle adoption can play a central role in meeting emission targets for the transportation sector. The current literature does not cover all the interdependent sources of variation in the emissions and costs of BEVs compared to ICEVs. In particular, the effects of annual travel distance and fuel efficiency related to individual travel behavior and the wide variety of available vehicle models have not been assessed. In addition, this variation in emissions and costs of personal vehicles has only been studied across regions, but not across individual vehicles within each region due to vehicle-specific driving patterns. This work addresses these gaps by developing several interlinked models. This includes the construction of a parametrized lifecycle emissions and cost of ownership model (Chapter 2), an algorithm to measure driving style linked to a vehicle energy model (Chapter 3), and a model to quantify the variability in annual travel distance and fuel consumption of different types of vehicles across regions within the United States, encoded as zipcodes, and across individual vehicles within those zipcodes (Chapter 4). Chapter 5 then ties Chapters 2 and 4 together and complements them with additional information to assess the overall heterogeneity in the emissions reduction potential of BEVs. The central results of the thesis are threefold. First, a rapid decarbonization of electricity in conjunction with an electrification of powertrains will likely be required to meet emission targets for the U.S. transportation sector. Measures that relate to heterogeneous consumer behavior, such as improving driving style and nudging consumers towards purchasing smaller vehicles, can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Second, the electrification of powertrains can come at little to no additional expense to consumers with today's technology and prices. In most parts of the country, BEVs are substantially cheaper than comparable ICEVs. Within regions, the individuals for which BEVs offer the greatest emissions savings would also tend to experience the largest cost savings, since both emissions savings and cost savings are correlated with annual travel distance. Third, emission reductions achieved by BEVs and their costs relative to ICEVs are highly heterogeneous. The within-region variation in emissions and costs of BEVs compared to ICEVs due to individual driving patterns is at least as large as the variation across regional averages. As a result, a 10% share of BEVs in the fleet can lead to anywhere between 1% and 10% emission reductions, depending on which types of vehicles are being replaced by electric vehicles, by whom, and where. A key application of this work is to inform tools that provide localized and personalized information about the environmental and economic performance of different vehicle models. In Chapter 6, we discuss such a tool that was built as part of this work, called Carboncounter.com. Results from a survey launched on Carboncounter add to existing evidence that providing such information to consumers can help inform a transition to a cleaner light-duty vehicle fleet. These findings further confirm the importance of understanding heterogeneous human behaviors to inform decarbonization strategies for personal transport.",2020,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2020 Ph.D.,Book Title: Variability in the emissions savings potential of battery electric vehicles across regions and individuals,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VP2CCBAI,thesis,2017,"Lâm, Long Thanh",Innovation in China’s Renewable Energy Industry,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Innovation_in_China_s_Renewable_Energy_Industry/6720218/1,"This dissertation includes three studies that examine the remarkable rise of China’s renewable energy industry and its technological contributions to the global industry. China has emerged as the world’s largest carbon emitter by a large margin, and many of its cities experience high levels of air pollution. The Chinese government has turned to wind – and later solar – as alternative power sources to help decarbonize its electricity system and ameliorate increasingly urgent air pollution problems. Through these efforts, China has markedly expanded the share of renewable energy in its energy mix, and in the process absorbed a fair amount of relatively advanced technology, establishing itself as a competitive location to manufacture clean power equipment. In short order China has bolstered its international standing as a renewable energy powerhouse. The first study evaluates the question of whether China's wind industry has become an important source of clean energy technology innovation. Results indicate that while China has delivered enormous progress in terms of wind capacity, the outcomes were more limited in terms of innovation and cost competitiveness. Chinese wind turbine manufacturers have secured few international patents and achieved moderate learning rates relative to the global industry’s historical learning rate. The success of China’s transition to a low-carbon energy system will be key to achieve the global level of emissions reductions needed to avoid large negative consequences from climate change. The second study shows that China made progress in bringing down the levelized cost of wind electricity and cost of carbon mitigation. However, widespread grid-connection issues and wind curtailment rates caused much higher-than-anticipated costs of renewable energy integration. China has emerged as the global manufacturing center for solar photovoltaic products, and Chinese firms have entered all stages of the supply chain in short order. The third study provides detailed expert assessments of the technological and nontechnological factors that led to the surprised success of China’s silicon photovoltaic industry. Expert judgments suggest that continued declines in in module and system costs and improvements in performance will allow solar photovoltaic to be competitive with fossil fuels in China.",5/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720218.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hackathons are collaborative, short sprints that offer such collaboration opportunities. While usually coding marathons, hackathon-type events like an Education Designathon and Education DesignShop have been developed by the researcher to tackle broad, systemic issues, here within the context of education, with tools and processes from design thinking. Two research questions are explored, with novel metrics and methods developed for each: 1) How do non-designers transform into design thinkers from the Education DesignShop? and 2) How do educational projects from the Education DesignShop workshop model address systemic changes? In the first pilot study of this thesis, an Education Designathon event emphasizes on this designerly mindset and the projects. Fourteen ingredients critical to the successful recipe of a hackathon, or Designathon-type event were identified.

In addition to identifying applications and developing the methods for incorporating these data in engineering and economic analyses, the nontechnical aspects of these issues are also considered as implementation of these solutions depends on more than their technical feasibility. The first study frames the existing methods being used today to build a device-level accounting of where energy is used in the residential sector in the US. Three methods are identified and categorized: direct metering methods, non-intrusive load monitoring, and statistical methods. Two of the most prominent studies are compared, and a method is proposed by which the Department of Energy (DOE) and others could easily and cost-effectively incorporate existing submetered data into their estimates of device-level energy consumption in the US. In the second study, energy audit and survey records are used to model 106 homes in the DOE’s EnergyPlus building simulation software. Simulation results are compared to submetered data from the audited homes to provide a device-level measure of the accuracy of EnergyPlus models in a large sample of homes. Results show the models do not accurately or consistently estimate occupied home energy use due to factors such as occupant behaviors and appliance stocks which are not well-captured in traditional audit reports. These results provide context for the growing use of EnergyPlus models for homes, and highlight that care is needed to ensure that decision-makers are aware of its limitations. The third study uses device-level data to assess the technical and economic feasibility of distributing direct current (DC) power in homes with solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays. Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate the costs and benefits of this intervention while accounting for uncertainty in the engineering, economic, and other parameters. Results show significant energy savings potential, but at present DC equipment prices these savings are not cost-effective. In addition to quantifying energy and cost savings, a number of major nontechnical barriers to implementing DC distribution in homes are identified. In the final study, an expert elicitation is conducted with 17 experts on DC systems to better understand these barriers. Results show that the two biggest barriers to adoption are industry professionals unfamiliar with DC and small markets for DC devices and components. To address these, experts proposed developing training programs for engineers and electricians, and developing pilot projects to prove the benefits of DC in niche applications where DC power distribution holds a clear advantage over alternating current (AC). Experts also identified lasting and inherent benefits of DC that make these systems better suited to serve future building loads.",5/1/17,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715931.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A predominance of tacit knowledge, information asymmetries, and insufficient human capital with knowledge in the field can contribute to this delay. At this technical frontier, expert decision making drives criticalresearch and development. By surveying the top experts in an industry that exemplifies the technical frontier, metal additive manufacturing for aerospace, I find that there is inconsistency in decision making structure and process both within and across experts. This inconsistency leads toan investigation of how to evaluate accuracy in a field when gathering outcome data is expensive or only exists in the future (as is the case at the technical frontier). I prove bounds on expert accuracy that rely on response structure without requiring outcome data for validation. The inconsistency in expert decision process seen in the survey case study motivates the search for a single tool to learna diverse set of behavioral decision making models.

W3SS9WEI,thesis,2010,"Morisset, Thomas; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Comparing capacities and delays at major European and American airports,,,,,,"Successful air transport systems must satisfy the demand for flights while maintaining a high level of service and safety. For airports, which have limited capacities, policy-makers must compromise between maximizing the number of flights served and avoiding excessive delays. Differences between policies adopted in the US and in Europe result in distinct airport performances, the analysis of which reveals best practices. The first point of comparison is over the capacities of a set of the busiest airports in the US and Europe. Under radar-based air traffic control procedures, Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), American airports achieve equal or higher capacities than European airports with similar runway layouts. These discrepancies cannot be explained by the differences in separation requirements alone. Besides, through their extensive use of Visual Flight Rules (VFR), weather permitting, American airports gain an important premium on their capacities. US air traffic control practices and policies clearly result in a more efficient use of airport infrastructure. Second, arrival delays relative to schedule increase over the course of the day at the US airports, while they remain mostly constant in Europe. Similarly the distributions of these delays show that schedule reliability at airports is significantly better in Europe than in the US. These comparisons underscore the benefits of Europe's policy of airport slot-controls, which cap the number of aircraft movements at a declared capacity. Moreover, arrival delays in the US are much higher under IFR (23 minutes average) than VFR (9 minutes). This shows that the high variability of the capacity of US airports depending on weather conditions, coupled with the tendency toward over-scheduling of flights, is damaging to the national airport system's stability and reliability. From these comparisons stem a few policy recommendations. Airline schedule reliability might benefit from additional controls or economic incentives to rationalize the scheduling of aircraft movements at some US airports. At the same time, some European airports could benefit from increasing their declared capacities. More generally, European aviation authorities should consider relaxing air traffic control separation procedures along the lines of US practices.",2010,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: Comparing capacities and delays at major European and American airports,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WCP7BC3S,thesis,2010,"Elkina, Olga Sergeevna",Economic Behaviour of Workers in the Labour Market: Strategies and Trends,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2321017624?pq-origsite=primo,"Relevance of the research topic. In recent years, the problems of strategic development of Russia, stimulated interest in the study of economic behavior, based on the fact that economic behavior determines the actions of people and their reactions, which are responsible for changes in the market, and is a tool to predict the results of various changes in the most important components of any market. The effectiveness of reforms depends not least on the adequacy of the integration and adaptation of the most important components of human behavior in modern economic relations and institutions that have generated new types of economic behavior that have a significant impact on the economy, but have not been studied enough. A special need for knowledge of the economic behavior of the employee has a scientific field that studies the labor market. The priority need is explained by the fact that the situation in the labor market has an impact on the processes of economic development and largely determines their intensity. Thus, in modern conditions there is an urgent need to monitor the economic behavior of a person, his reaction to the change of priorities of social development, change in the nature of labor relations, and as a result – to predict changes in the labor market in the conditions of dynamic development of society. And the basis for the choice of methods of resolving problems and ways of regulating the labor market should be based on an understanding of how the economic decision is made by the subject in the social and labor sphere. The choice of a specific economic decision by the employee is primarily due to the purpose of directing his actions, and which he adheres to in the sphere of labor relations for a relatively long time. This goal defines the causes and orientation of work, the choice of type of employment and the specific workplace and is reflected in the strategies of economic behavior. This strategy determines the compatibility of the employee with working conditions, acceptable conditions for the use of labor potential, determines its cost-compensatory nature of relations with the company, the amount of labor productivity, and so on. At the same time, the strategies of economic behavior of the employee are formed as a result of the influence of various factors acting both on the part of the employee and on the part of the labor market as a whole. All these factors are dynamic and unstable in modern conditions. Therefore, the effectiveness of management actions on the labor market is determined by the ability to predict and influence the strategy of economic behavior of employees. Understanding the strategies of economic behavior of employees, will create new models of work motivation, encouraging modern workers to efficient and high-performance work, and leading to the set management goals while minimizing costs through the use of sustainable employee goals. The undeveloped theoretical and methodological approaches and tools aimed at studying the strategies of economic behavior of workers in the labor market, determines the relevance of the chosen topic. The degree of development of the problem. The existing theoretical and methodological approaches develop the conceptual apparatus, reveal the essence and content of economic behavior, determine the directions of research and management of economic behavior. Despite the fact that the existing scientific approaches have made a significant contribution to the explanation of the causes and mechanisms of economic behavior, the impact of behavior on a particular market, on the efficiency of economic activity, many topical issues still remain unresolved. In particular, in the field of labour market research, the focus of research is on the study of labour behaviour, labour activity, gender segregation, psychological factors of job satisfaction, mobility and workers ' movements. The literature presents a limited range of theoretical models of strategies of economic behavior, differentiated by branches of scientific knowledge and methodological approaches to the study, resulting in their findings are poorly coordinated with each other, and sometimes contradictory. In addition, there is a substitution of definitions when the strategy is understood as a trend of behavior in certain conditions, rather than actions aimed at achieving a long-term goal. The very economic behavior of the employee is reduced to the choice of the duration of employment under a given system of payment and working conditions, and there are no studies where labor costs are estimated comprehensively, not only from the quantitative side, but also from the qualitative side. The presence of different, inconsistent models, due to the lack of a mechanism for identifying behavior with a certain strategy of economic behavior, the methodology for measuring the strategies themselves, due to the lack of development of the General theory of economic behavior of the employee in the labor market as a form of implementation of labor. However, it is in the labor market that the economic interests of various subjects (labor carriers, employers, organizations, the region) collide, which determine their behavior in the economic system of society. All this puts before science the task of understanding and studying the patterns of implementation of economic behavior of the employee as an economic entity in the labor market. Describing the reasons why the study of economic behavior and strategies of workers is not an established subject area of domestic economic science, Russian researchers point to an underestimation of the elasticity of behavior of workers in the labor market in research, with the established assumptions that the dynamics and trends in the labor market are determined by demand. But there is another set of factors that constrain the study of economic behavior of workers in the labor market. Economic analysis of processes related to economic behavior suggests the presence of microdata bases. Limited number of databases microdata, revealing the dimensions of the economic behavior of workers, and especially their strategies, just acts as a deterrent. The author sees the solution of these problems in the integration of different approaches to the analysis of such a complex socio-economic phenomenon, which is possible within the framework of a systematic approach that allows a comprehensive approach to solving these problems. The importance of the problem of improving the ways to regulate the labor market on the basis of typical models of employee behavior for the theory and practice of forming an effective social policy, as well as its complexity and scale require serious theoretical understanding, methodological and methodological developments, primarily on the basis of a systematic approach to its solution. The purpose of the study is to develop the concept of economic behavior strategies of employees on the basis of a systematic approach to the labor market and to substantiate the concept of management of development of economic behavior strategies of employees in order to stabilize or change the current state of the labor market. The object of research economic behavior in the labor market as a theoretical and methodological scientific field, studying the labor market from the standpoint of cost-compensation nature of human relations and society, and reveals trends and patterns of labor, labor supply, distribution and use of labor resources The subject of the study of the strategy of economic behavior of workers in the labor market as a form of implementation of economic behavior in the labor market. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study are the fundamental provisions and categorical apparatus of classical and neoclassical economic theory, institutional theory, General theory of systems, the concept of sustainable development, management theory, theory of organizations, theory of organizational behavior, labor Economics. The thesis uses General scientific research methods: system approach, analysis and synthesis, methods of grouping, comparative analysis, logical comparison, graphic interpretation, modeling, sociological methods, static methods of information processing, scientific observation. The information base of the study was the results of fundamental and applied research of the classics of economic theory and modern scientists in the field of labor Economics, labor supply and personnel management, the database of the Russian monitoring of economy and health (rmez), the data of the Federal state statistics service of the Russian Federation, the database of the population Survey on employment problems) - statistical studies conducted by the Federal service of state statistics, databases of the Unified archive of sociological data of the Independent Institute of social policy (ISSP), databases of the all-Russian center for the study of public opinion (VTSIOM), databases of the Institute of marketing research GFK Rus (Gfk Group), statistical collections and information presented on the Internet on official websites, legislative and regulatory acts of the Russian Federation in the field of labor and management. In the preparation of the dissertation research the generalized information obtained by the author during the sociological research conducted in 1999 and 2007 was used. In total, the characteristics of economic behavior of 3336 employees of 43 enterprises of Omsk were studied. The survey using the interview method covered 96 heads of enterprises and personnel departments of organizations of Omsk and Omsk region.

Based on queueing theory, including blocking and reneging, different operations management strategies are compared using this discrete event simulation tool. To simulate wait times, users input arrival rates, service times, patience, probabilities of relapses and probabilities to go from one program to another. We determine that blocking is one of the main drivers of the delays. This model is not only useful for direct decision making, such as increasing capacity in one of the programs, but also to enable systems thinking in the VA. Indeed, if more quantitative methods were used at different levels of the organization, managers could take more informed decisions faster. This also prompts for rigorous data collection, which is something the VA needs, especially wait times for mental health clinics.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Improving access through stochastic modeling in Veterans Affairs Mental Health Services,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recall of the prescription drug Vioxx (Rofecoxib) was used as a test case to study whether STAMP (Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Processes) could be used to outline the interactions between the different pharmaceutical system components, identify the safety control structure in place and understand how this control structure failed to prevent the marketing of an unsafe drug which killed an estimated 27,000 people in the United States. To supplement this static analysis, System Dynamics models were used to analyze the social and organizational dynamics that underline the US healthcare system and to understand how the system moved from a safe to an unsafe state which allowed a dangerous drug to be left on the market for over five years. The recall of Vioxx was followed by a number of legislative changes, in particular the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act of 2007. Those changes were mapped on the safety control structure and again System Dynamics models were used to understand the systemic implications of the policy changes. The models suggested that further changes might be necessary to protect the American public and so, based on the results of the STAMP analysis, a new set of systemic recommendations was proposed.",2010,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: A case study of Vioxx using STAMP,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WF4S6L9W,thesis,2010,"Murphy, Paul Jarod; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",The role of natural gas as a vehicle transportation fuel,,,,,,"This thesis analyzes pathways to directly use natural gas, as compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG), in the transportation sector. The thesis focuses on identifying opportunities to reduce market barriers in order to make the US natural gas vehicle market more efficient. We also identify vehicle market segments where NGV technology is mature and does not require sustained public subsidy to economically compete with comparable gasoline or diesel vehicles. This thesis finds that natural gas can play a useful but modest role as a vehicle fuel in the US, predominantly as CNG in high-mileage, light-duty fleet vehicles and in heavy-duty, short-haul fleet vehicles. For light-duty applications, there is a need to address an existing market barrier in the US by reducing the incremental cost and improving the vehicle performance of CNG vehicles to levels found in Europe. This incremental cost reduction is critical to foster market penetration in high-mileage fleet vehicles and to create a potential opportunity for market penetration beyond high-mileage fleet vehicles to average-mileage individual drivers. Increased use of CNG in light duty vehicles would displace petroleum, reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, and hedge consumers from volatile world oil prices (if CNG is used in a bi-fuel - gasoline and CNG- vehicle). In the heavy-duty, short-haul sector, CNG provides an additional benefit of reduced nitrogen oxide emissions compared to diesel trucks. With respect to long-haul LNG trucks, this thesis finds that while there is a large potential market for natural gas in the long-haul truck market, the present prospects for the use of LNGpowered long haul trucks appears quite limited. This is due to high incremental costs, unresolved operational issues, fueling infrastructure requirements, and reluctance of the trucking industry.",2010,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: The role of natural gas as a vehicle transportation fuel,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the variables that contribute to lower rates of recidivism and factors that keep people from reoffending. Participants were recruited through college-based programs as well as work-study programs that help formerly incarcerated individuals. This study uses a qualitative phenomenological method with a semi-structured interview to explore each individual's experience of the penal system. Eight participants who have successfully reentered society were interviewed. This study found that during incarceration, the penal system was perceived by participants as problematic in some way, leading to a desire to change. External support was found to be the primary external variable that contributes to successful reentry. This support was evidenced by others showing interest in participants as well as the availability of tangible resources (e.g., higher education, housing, or employment). All participants cited introspection and a deep commitment to change (as compared to desire alone) as helpful internal variables. The common phenomena identified by this researcher are 1) a significant identity shift either during incarceration or after release, 2) a marked change in thought process adopted by the participant, and 3) a drive to be altruistic after release. For this population, clinical implications include the need to focus treatment on the following: risk reduction, setting realistic goals, frustration tolerance, emotional regulation, individual strengths, understanding one's locus of control, and preparing for acculturation during reentry. Treatment for trauma and substance abuse should be available for those that need it, and when possible, incorporating family therapy and altruistic activities for individuals is strongly encouraged. Each participant spoke to the need for systemic change; better communication and collaboration is needed between prison staff, policymakers, healthcare professionals, law enforcement, and current and former inmates. Through access to improved resources for formerly incarcerated individuals after release, the hope is that crime rates and recidivism will reduce, and taxpayers will save money.",2011,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,Closing the Revolving Door,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Closing the Revolving Door: Variables that Contribute to Lower rates of Recidivism in Prisons in the United States ISBN: 9781124902357 ISSN: 0419-4217 Issue: 12 Pages: 7703 Volume: 72,,,,,Acculturation; Clinical psychology; Communication; Criminology; Imprisonment; Prisoners; Recidivism; Risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WGX9UQ6I,thesis,2012,"Mauch, Brandon Keith",Managing Wind Power Forecast Uncertainty in Electric Grids,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Managing_Wind_Power_Forecast_Uncertainty_in_Electric_Grids/6720479/1,"Electricity generated from wind power is both variable and uncertain. Wind forecasts provide valuable information for wind farm management, but they are not perfect. Chapter 2 presents a model of a wind farm with compressed air energy storage (CAES) participating freely in the day-ahead electricity market without the benefit of a renewable portfolio standard or production tax credit. CAES is used to reduce the risk of committing uncertain quantities of wind energy and to shift dispatch of wind generation to high price periods. Using wind forecast data and market prices from 2006 – 2009, we find that the annual income for the modeled wind-CAES system would not cover annualized capital costs. We also estimate market prices with a carbon price of $20 and $50 per tonne CO2 and find that the revenue would still not cover the capital costs. The implied cost per tonne of avoided CO2 to make a wind-CAES profitable from trading on the day-ahead market is roughly $100, with large variability due to electric power prices. Wind power forecast errors for aggregated wind farms are often modeled with Gaussian distributions. However, data from several studies have shown this to be inaccurate. Further, the distribution of wind power forecast errors largely depends on the wind power forecast value. The few papers that account for this dependence bin the wind forecast data and fit parametric distributions to the actual wind power in each bin. A method to model wind power forecast uncertainty as a single closed-form solution using a logit transformation of historical wind power forecast and actual wind power data is presented in Chapter 3. Once transformed, the data become close to jointly normally distributed. We show the process of calculating confidence intervals for wind power forecast errors using the jointly normally distributed logit transformed data. This method has the advantage of fitting the entire dataset with five parameters while also providing the ability to make calculations conditioned on the value of the wind power forecast. The model present in Chapter 3 is applied in Chapter 4 to calculate increases in net load uncertainty introduced from day-ahead wind power forecasts. Our analyses uses data from two different electric grids in the U.S. having similar levels of installed wind capacity with large differences in wind and load forecast accuracy due to geographic characteristics. A probabilistic method to calculate the dispatchable generation capacity required to balance day-ahead wind and load forecast errors for a given level of reliability is presented. Using empirical data we show that the capacity requirements for 95% day-ahead reliability range from 2100 MW to 5600 MW for ERCOT and 1900 MW to 4500 MW for MISO, depending on the amount of wind and load forecast for the next day. We briefly discuss the additional requirements for higher reliability levels and the effect of correlated wind and load forecast errors. Additionally, we show that each MW of additional wind power capacity in ERCOT must be matched by a 0.30 MW day-ahead dispatchable generation capacity to cover 95% of day-ahead uncertainty. Due to the lower wind forecast uncertainty in MISO, the value drops to 0.13 MW of dispatchable capacity for each MW of additional wind capacity. Direct load control (DLC) has received a lot of attention lately as an enabler of wind power. One major benefit of DLC is the added flexibility it brings to the grid. Utilities in some parts of the U.S. can bid the load reduction from DLC into energy markets. Forecasts of the resource available for DLC assist in determining load reduction quantities to offer. In Chapter 5, we present a censored regression model to forecast load from residential air conditioners using historical load data, hour of the day, and ambient temperature. We tested the forecast model with hourly data from 467 air conditioners located in three different utilities. We used two months of data to train the model and then ran day-ahead forecasts over a six week period. Mean square errors ranged from 4% to 8% of mean air conditioner load. This method produced accurate forecasts with much lower data requirements than physics based forecast models.",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720479.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WHNSTUJW,thesis,2010,"Tejada Abreu, Alicia M.",Print media paper consumption patterns through a system dynamics approach,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/751592291?pq-origsite=primo,"As awareness of the current unsustainable state of our society increases, it has become evident that immediate action is needed to change this state. Many of the ecological changes that threaten the long-term survival of humans and of other species have anthropogenic origins. Industry’s impact and its role in mitigating these impacts is the focus of much discussion and debate. Two industries that are working to deal with these issues are the printing and paper industries. The environmental impacts associated with the entire life-cycle of paper are significant, yet the socially redeeming value of the content printed can be equally as significant. A curious paradox is that advances in information and communication technology (ICT) have long been predicted to lead to a reduction in media use, resulting in the so-called paperless office, but this has not been the case. Until recently, the observed trends worldwide demonstrate that in most countries paper consumption has been on the rise, however in some developed countries there is some suggestion that this trend may be reversing. The work of Sellen and Harper (2002) provides a qualitative explanation of why paper consumption is on the rise. Nonetheless, there is little research that develops quantitative models to explain paper consumption patterns. This thesis leverages Sellen and Harper’s qualitative models to develop a system dynamics model to explain the effects and interactions between ICT, the affordances of paper and paper-like technologies, and knowledge work flows. Specifically, the Bass Diffusion technology adoption model and the path dependence patterns of behavior are modified in an attempt to reproduce the paper consumption patterns observed in the United States (US). Sensitivity analysis through the use of a fractional factorial experiment has been performed to identify the most influential model parameters to set the model parameters at values that best represent US data. An assessment of the system dynamic model’s utility based on a publically available quantitative study of the amount of original information that is produced and stored each year is also presented in this study.

WHUAM72Q,thesis,2010,"Lindsey, Johnathan Jake; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Characterizing opportunities for short reach optical interconnect adoption: a market survey and total cost of ownership model approach,,,,,,"Over the past decade, the demand for digital information has increased dramatically with the rising use of the Internet and various types of multimedia data - text, audio, graphics, video, and voice. As a consequence, the technologies that connect and transport data have become critically important. Available interconnect technologies are broadly organized into two categories: electrical and optical. Although many digital systems use electrical interconnects, optical interconnects are becoming an attractive alternative as electrical connection has become increasingly difficult in terms of cost and performance. However, the transition from electrical to optical interconnects across multiple markets could still be hampered by its higher cost relative to interconnects in the mid-term. Thus, this work seeks to shed light on the following question: ""What additional characteristics are useful to evaluate the attractiveness of optical interconnects in emerging markets?"" This thesis seeks to explore and answer this question in three parts. The first part of the thesis attempts to gauge the opportunities and barriers to optical interconnect adoption in emerging markets through an analysis of first phase interviews with professionals working in the datacom, automobile, consumer hand-held device industries. Initial review of the response set shows that of the five initial emerging markets for optical interconnect, datacom, specifically high-performance computing (HPC), has the greatest potential for increased optical interconnect adoption in the near future. To further explore the environment for optical interconnects in the HPC, a second, more detailed questionnaire was distributed to a limited number of interviewees. In response to this interview, some respondents noted that several metrics other than cost and performance, particularly power consumption, as being ""very important"" when deciding which technology to adopt. The second part of the thesis is primarily concerned with investigating further the influence that power and performance concerns have on optical interconnect adoption in HPC data centers. Specifically, this part of the thesis seeks to explore whether power concerns in data centers could lead to increased adoption of optical interconnects. To that end, a cost model of an HPC data center has been developed to identify the possible economic impacts that the adoption of optical interconnect technologies would have in a power-driven scenario. The third part of this thesis presents a set of policy recommendations based on the results from the data center cost model.",2010,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,Characterizing opportunities for short reach optical interconnect adoption,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2010 S.M.,Book Title: Characterizing opportunities for short reach optical interconnect adoption : a market survey and total cost of ownership model approach,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WJMRRDWK,thesis,2015,"Nakagawa, Mana",Global Rise or Persistent Inequalities? A Cross-National Analysis of Women Faculty,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2500419700?pq-origsite=primo,"Over the last decade, women have increasingly outnumbered men in higher education enrollments in the vast majority of countries around the world. Yet, studies reveal that women continue to be underrepresented as faculty, particularly in the higher echelons of the academic hierarchy and across traditionally male-dominated disciplines. This dissertation explores the global status of women faculty in higher education institutions from historical, national, and organizational level perspectives. The experiences of women faculty have been well documented in specific countries and regions throughout the world, but the extent to which these trends can be generalized in a global and historical context is far less understood.My first paper utilizes data from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics to examine the global trends of women faculty attainment across 93 countries from 1970 to 2012. Using descriptive analysis and country-fixed effects regression analysis, I examine (1) how women faculty have advanced cross-nationally over time, and (2) to what extent these changes are driven by global and transnational dynamics, and/or by country-level characteristics. Although the conditions of women academics have been widely examined across different countries worldwide, extant studies have largely been cross-sectional in nature, or focused on single country or university contexts. The contribution of this paper is to examine the phenomenon from a cross-national and longitudinal perspective. I find that despite the current prevailing discourse focusing on the underrepresentation of women academics, women's share of faculty positions has in fact grown dramatically and consistently over the last several decades.While the first paper provides an important historical context to understanding the current status of women faculty worldwide, more recent research emphasizes the unequal access and opportunities that women faculty continue to face in reaching the higher ranks of tenure, particularly in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields. In order to understand these gender differences among academic faculty, the second paper employs a comparative analysis of women faculty in current-day, top ranked universities worldwide. Given the limited availability of comparative international data on women faculty, I utilize a uniquely constructed dataset on over 12,000 current faculty (2013-14 academic year) from 13 advanced and developing countries, across four diverse fields of study. The investigation relies on descriptive and multi-level analyses focusing on two main dependent variables: (1) women's share of faculty positions inside higher education institutions across four fields of study, and (2) women's share of tenured or permanent faculty positions inside a higher education institution, across disciplines. I find that in this current-day sample of elite universities worldwide, women are in fact, vastly underrepresented at the tenure ranks across all fields of study across the 13 countries, and particularly in engineering. From a global perspective, countries that are interlinked to a world society are more likely to see women in faculty positions across all ranks and disciplines. Various political and structural factors at the national level jointly contribute to the limited advancement of women faculty, particularly in the science and engineering fields, as well as in higher ranks of faculty positions across disciplines.The third article examines the organizational-level characteristics of higher education institutions that contribute to the growth of women faculty across the 52 elite universities for which data is uniquely collected. I find a wide variation in the institutional characteristics associated with differing levels of women's representation in faculty positions. Most prominently, the presence of women department heads is significantly linked to greater representations of women faculty, both overall and at higher ranks of tenure. Building on feminist and organizational-level theories, I argue that the current underrepresentation of women in higher ranks of faculty are functions of a dynamic, multi-level gender system in which global-, national- and organizational-level processes work together to perpetuate the gender segregation in academic hierarchies across the world.This dissertation contributes a unique examination of the status of women faculty in a global context from a variety of sociological, feminist, and organizational frameworks and perspectives. Given the cross-national scope of these papers, the findings contribute new evidence for the generalizability of existing theories on women in higher education cross-nationally, beyond the existing state of theories focusing on single country studies. As the under-representation of women, particularly in elite and leadership positions, spans diverse socio-economic and political contexts around the world, these papers further offer new considerations for scholars and stakeholders invested in the broader issues of gender, work and organizations.",2015,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,Global Rise or Persistent Inequalities?,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Global Rise or Persistent Inequalities?

Why do we continue to struggle with the management of deteriorating infrastructure systems when capable engineering systems exist for monitoring, identifying, andprioritizing facets of these systems? The prevailing view of infrastructure systems assumes that they are exogenous to society and thus largely focus on the social impacts of the technical facets of such systems (infrastructure → society). Utilizing institutional theory, science and technologystudies, and social movement theory, this thesis advances the perspective that social factors have an influence on the technical parameters of infrastructure systems; infrastructure is therefore endogenous to society (society → infrastructure). The interplay between social and technicalfactors is explored through three complementary sections using a variety of statistical methods and 21 years of data from the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) of the United States Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and other sources.The first paper explores the institutional constraints that inhibit bridge managers from addressing challenges with remediation of outdated bridges. More specifically, it depicts bridges as institutional relics, whereby a bridge’s physical attributes reflect the accepted standards of thetime and later persist even when those standards may change. Bridges are more likely to be institutional relics when built prior to the adoption of national design mandates (regulative-based relics) or in locales whose engineering norms conflict with these national standards (normativebased relics). Bridge ownership and the spatial constraints present in more urban settings moderate the ability of bridge managers to address those bridges that are identified as relics. The second paper focuses on the role of attachment to institutional relics and its potential toinspire collective action around preserving them. Specifically, it considers movements to enroll bridges into the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on closure rates and subsequent sufficiency. Not only do bridges enrolled on the NRHP have a lower risk of closure in postenrollmentyears as compared to similar non-enrolled bridges, but these movements also restrict engineering options on enrolled bridges, with improvements focused on non-historic elements (i.e. the bridge’s substructure). This informs social movement research by considering movements of preservation instead of change and how movements can directly influence the built environment as an end goal.In the third paper, bridge sufficiency is considered through the lens of inspection data to identify influential attributes affecting monitoring of potential institutional relics. A framework is developed for providing feedback to bridge managers, designers, and policymakers. Givencomputation challenges, previous studies understandably and necessarily begin with a limited scope, data, or variable selection. This study leverages novel computational techniques, namely a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach, that can morecomprehensively consider the entire United States bridge system and its variables to inform attribute selection. It finds that a mixture of inspector-driven variables, design/maintenance variables, and weather are highly influential in calculating overall bridge sufficiency rating.Many of the factors that persistently influence bridge sufficiency are also related to social challenges, namely the presence of institutional relics, explored previously. As such, this paper presents one possible computational approach for scoping the most salient technical and socialvariables for which bridge designers and managers should focus attention when seeking to monitor bridge deterioration. These results are then tied to contemporary issues in bridge management and used to propose policy actions within each section of findings to better address bridge management issues. In sum, this thesis helps advance a more sociological understanding toward infrastructure, namely how social parameters can influence engineering systems, as applied in the context of bridgesystems.",8/8/18,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,Infrastructure as Institutional Relics,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/7212962.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WTF7FFKW,thesis,2015,"Du, Yichen; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Analysis on the impacts of electricity tariffs on the attractiveness of gas fired distributed combined heat and power systems,,,,,,"In order to achieve a more sustainable energy system, regulators and the industry are trying to balance among many challenging issues such as environmental concerns, economic efficiency and security of supply. In Europe, the environmental concerns are getting a higher weight in current discussions. While it is important to continue exploring the potential of renewables as well as other clean energy sources, finding a more effective way to utilize existing resources is also a viable solution. Combined heat and Power (CHP), also known as cogeneration, denotes a group of technologies that generate electricity and useful heat concurrently. Benefits of distributed CHP technologies arise from their direct connection to distribution and customer facilities, which can potentially alleviate transmission and distribution network constraints, lower network energy losses, improve system reliability, and result in CO2 emissions reductions and overall capital cost. This thesis focuses on understanding the technological, social and economic attractiveness of CHP technologies under different tariff designs, market conditions and incentives. It not only looks at the optimum economic value of CHP to individual customers, but also impacts on the system peak load and the environment. For that purpose, the thesis develops a methodology that focuses on analyzing customers' reactions to various exogenous parameters by looking at their CHP installation and operation decisions. Moreover, it adopts an overarching framework that integrates and streamlines the processes from simulation of customers' energy loads, representation of regulatory and market conditions, to the generation and interpretation of the installation and operations decisions. Results suggest that many distributed CHP technologies could bring positive economic value to the customers even without considering incentives. In the meanwhile, metrics like CO2 emissions, overall efficiency and system peak reduction all improved with the introduction of NGDCHPs. These observations confirm that NGDCHP systems have the potential to reduce costs at both the individual customers' level and at the system level. Moreover, we find that customers' decisions are noticeably influenced by the tariffication and incentive methods. Volumetric-only tariffs suffer from potential cross-subsidization and insufficient remuneration for network companies, but encourage higher utilization rate and installations because of the higher variable electricity price. In comparison, breaking down the electricity prices based on different cost drivers could send the correct economic signals to the customers while still meeting the sustainability principle for tariff designs. Additionally, we find that changing market conditions can have significant effects on the economic value of CHP systems installed on-site, and the annual savings are most sensitive to electricity purchase prices. In conclusion, the goal of this research is to explore the value of gas fired distributed CHP systems under different settings. It informs the private sector as well as the policymakers by how to realize the potential benefits of distributed CHP systems. In the future, the methodology and framework developed in this thesis could be further applied to analyze scenarios where distributed CHP penetration is high and is coupled with other distributed energy resources.",2015,5/22/25 18:31,5/22/25 18:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Analysis on the impacts of electricity tariffs on the attractiveness of gas fired distributed combined heat and power systems,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
X2JU94E6,thesis,2018,"Jenkins, Jesse D.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems","Electricity system planning with distributed energy resources: new methods and insights for economics, regulation, and policy",,,,,,"This dissertation demonstrates a novel integrated electric power system planning framework that incorporates distributed energy resources (DERs), flexible and price-responsive demand, and distribution network losses and reinforcement costs. New methods are developed and demonstrated to derive the aggregate impact of demand and DERs on distribution network losses and upgrade costs from detailed distribution network simulations. The results from these simulations are used to parameterize a novel and tractable representation of distribution networks at an aggregate scale in a new formulation of the electricity resource capacity planning problem. A set of case studies demonstrate the utility of this modeling framework for modeling competition amongst distributed and centralized resources, exploring tradeoffs between economies of unit scale and locational value of various resources, assessing the value of price-responsive electricity demand, and considering the impact of policy or regulation that drives the adoption of DERs. Methodologically, this dissertation makes a set of contributions, including: 1. A new approach to using AC power flow simulations to accurately derive the effect of aggregate changes in power withdrawals and injections on resistive network losses in large-scale distribution networks. 2. A method for adapting AC optimal power flow simulations to identify the minimum quantity of net reductions in coincident peak demand (achieved either by demand flexibility or distributed generation or storage) necessary to accommodate demand growth in large-scale distribution networks without investment in new network assets (e.g., 'non-wires' alternatives). 3. A method for using a distribution network planning model to determine the cost of traditional network upgrades required to accommodate an equivalent increase in peak demand. 4. An integrated electricity resource capacity planning model that employs results from the above methods to incorporate DERs and flexible demand and consider key sources of locational value or cost, including impacts on transmission and distribution network costs and losses. Electricity system planning models provide decision support for electric utilities, insight for policy-makers, and a detailed techno-economic framework to evaluate emerging technologies.

X4ZNTZXJ,thesis,2015,"Wolff, Josephine Charlotte Paulina; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",Classes of defense for computer systems,,,,,,"Computer security incidents often involve attackers acquiring a complex sequence of escalating capabilities and executing those capabilities across a range of different intermediary actors in order to achieve their ultimate malicious goals. However, popular media accounts of these incidents, as well as the ensuing litigation and policy proposals, tend to focus on a very narrow defensive landscape, primarily individual centralized defenders who control some of the capabilities exploited in the earliest stages of these incidents. This thesis proposes two complementary frameworks for defenses against computer security breaches -- one oriented around restricting the computer-based access capabilities that adversaries use to perpetrate those breaches and another focused on limiting the harm that those adversaries ultimately inflict on their victims. Drawing on case studies of actual security incidents, as well as the past decade of security incident data at MIT, it analyzes security roles and defense design patterns related to these broad classes of defense for application designers, administrators, and policy-makers. Application designers are well poised to undertake access defense by defining and distinguishing malicious and legitimate forms of activity in the context of their respective applications. Policy-makers can implement some harm limitation defenses by monitoring and regulating money flows, and also play an important role in collecting the data needed to expand understanding of the sequence of events that lead up to successful security incidents and inform which actors can and should effectively intervene as defenders. Organizations and administrators, meanwhile, occupy an in-between defensive role that spans both access and harm in addressing digital harms, or harms that are directly inflicted via computer capabilities, through restrictions on crucial intermediate harms and outbound information flows. The comparative case analysis ultimately points to a need to broaden defensive roles and responsibilities beyond centralized access defense and defenders, as well as the visibility challenges compounding externalities for defenders who may lack not only the incentives to intervene in such incidents but also the necessary knowledge to figure out how best to intervene.",2015,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology, Management, and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: Classes of defense for computer systems,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology, Management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
X5VW7HRG,thesis,2016,"Lamy, Julian","Optimal Locations for Siting Wind Energy Projects: Technical Challenges, Economics, and Public Preferences",,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Optimal_Locations_for_Siting_Wind_Energy_Projects_Technical_Challenges_Economics_and_Public_Preferences/6724454/1,"Increasing the percentage of wind power in the United States electricity generation mix would facilitate the transition towards a more sustainable, low-pollution, and environmentally-conscious electricity grid. However, this effort is not without cost. Wind power generation is time-variable and typically not synchronized with electricity demand (i.e., load). In addition, the highest-output wind resources are often located in remote locations, necessitating transmission investment between generation sites and load. Furthermore, negative public perceptions of wind projects could prevent widespread wind development, especially for projects close to densely-populated communities. The work presented in my dissertation seeks to understand where it’s best to locate wind energy projects while considering these various factors. First, in Chapter 2, I examine whether energy storage technologies, such as grid-scale batteries, could help reduce the transmission upgrade costs incurred when siting wind projects in distant locations. For a case study of a hypothetical 200 MW wind project in North Dakota that delivers power to Illinois, I present an optimization model that estimates the optimal size of transmission and energy storage capacity that yields the lowest average cost of generation and transmission ($/MWh). I find that for this application of storage to be economical, energy storage costs would have to be $100/kWh or lower, which is well below current costs for available technologies. I conclude that there are likely better ways to use energy storage than for accessing distant wind projects. Following from this work, in Chapter 3, I present an optimization model to estimate the economics of accessing high quality wind resources in remote areas to comply with renewable energy policy targets. I include temporal aspects of wind power (variability costs and correlation to market prices) as well as total wind power produced from different farms. I assess the goal of providing 40 TWh of new wind generation in the Midwestern transmission system (MISO) while minimizing system costs. Results show that building wind farms in North/South Dakota (windiest states) compared to Illinois (less windy, but close to population centers) would only be economical if the incremental transmission costs to access them were below $360/kW of wind capacity (break-even value). Historically, the incremental transmission costs for wind development in North/South Dakota compared to in Illinois are about twice this value. However, the break-even incremental transmission cost for wind farms in Minnesota/Iowa (also windy states) is $250/kW, which is consistent with historical costs. I conclude that for the case in MISO, building wind projects in more distant locations (i.e., Minnesota/Iowa) is most economical. My two final chapters use semi-structured interviews (Chapter 4) and conjoint-based surveys (Chapter 5) to understand public perceptions and preferences for different wind project siting characteristics such as the distance between the project and a person’s home (i.e., “not-in-my-backyard” or NIMBY) and offshore vs. onshore locations. The semi-structured interviews, conducted with members of a community in Massachusetts, revealed that economic benefit to the community is the most important factor driving perceptions about projects, along with aesthetics, noise impacts, environmental benefits, hazard to wildlife, and safety concerns. In Chapter 5, I show the results from the conjoint survey. The study’s sample included participants from a coastal community in Massachusetts and a U.S.-wide sample from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Results show that participants in the U.S.-wide sample perceived a small reduction in utility, equivalent to $1 per month, for living within 1 mile of a project. Surprisingly, I find no evidence of this effect for participants in the coastal community. The most important characteristic to both samples was the economic benefits from the project – both to their community through increased tax revenue, and to individuals through reduced monthly energy bills. Further, participants in both samples preferred onshore to offshore projects, but that preference was much stronger in the coastal community. I also find that participants from the coastal community preferred expanding an existing wind projects rather than building an entirely new one, whereas those in the U.S.-wide sample were indifferent, and equally supportive of the two options. These differences are likely driven by the prior positive experience the coastal community has had with an existing onshore wind project as well as their strong cultural identity that favors ocean views. I conclude that preference for increased distance from a wind project (NIMBY) is likely small or non-existent and that offshore wind projects within 5 miles from shore could cause large welfare losses to coastal communities. Finally, in Chapter 6, I provide a discussion and policy recommendations from my work. Importantly, I recommend that future research should combine the various topics throughout my chapters (i.e., transmission requirements, hourly power production, variability impacts to the grid, and public preferences) into a comprehensive model that identifies optimal locations for wind projects across the United States.",12/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:31,,,,,,,Optimal Locations for Siting Wind Energy Projects,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6724454.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant concerns over safety have been expressed. This research explores traditional engineering and biotechnology practices for overarching principles of design, testing and demonstration that address safety concerns. The information is used to assess the current state of design, testing and demonstration in current synthetic biology projects addressing safety. Component and system design literature provide an engineering backbone of safety systems however, biological attributes such as mutation, growth, and multiplication create safety gaps, where biological engineering practices are needed. These principles are organized into categories of design and testing, and testing and demonstration to gain greater insight on where gaps in the literature might lie. Retrospective cases of traditional engineering and current cases of biotechnologies provide external validation and further illustrate which practices address which design, testing and demonstration needs. While most of the traditional engineering cases addressed safety through design and testing, when they were faced with questions of safety, they presented specific efforts to gain public confidence. The pro-biotics case was different in that the safety concerns came from the scientific community since history is being used as the convincing demonstration of safety. The three synthetic biology research projects cross the divide between traditional engineering and biotechnologies, but theses efforts are firmly in the area of design and testing.

X7TD7W2F,thesis,2015,"Ellman, Douglas; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",The reference electrification model: a computer model for planning rural electricity access,,,,,,"Despite efforts from governments and other organizations, hundreds of millions of people-primarily in Africa and South Asia-still have no electricity service. Electrification efforts have historically been focused on extension of the main electric grid, but technology developments have made off-grid power systems, such as microgrids and home systems, viable alternatives for some areas. Especially since rural electrification typically depends on limited subsidies, if universal electrification is to be achieved in a timely manner, smart planning is essential to ensure that resources are directed towards cost-efficient technical solutions. Since the areas requiring electrification are expansive, the technology choices are many, and experience with off-grid systems is limited, planners struggle to evaluate tradeoffs between technology choices and estimate project costs. This thesis demonstrates that computer models that can automatically produce cost-efficient designs to the individual customer level can provide significant value to the planning process. The development of such a model by the author and collaborators at MIT and Comillas University, called the Reference Electrification Model (REM), is described. REM uses a series of heuristics to process input data, identify areas better suited for on-grid or off-grid electrification, and produce technical designs for recommended grid-extension and off-grid projects. In addition to the current state of REM, the rationale for model design choices and recommendations for future developments are described. The process and results of a pilot application of REM to Vaishali District, in Bihar, India are also described. REM will only be useful if it is actually incorporated into planning processes. In this spirit, concepts for how models like REM can benefit the regulation of rural electrification are presented, with a focus on India.",2015,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,The reference electrification model,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: The reference electrification model : a computer model for planning rural electricity access,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
X7Y8KW3V,thesis,2022,"Jahani, Eaman; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Network effects on outcomes and unequal distribution of resources,,,,,,"We focus on the link between networks and economic outcomes, study how networks affect different groups differently and in the process provide pathways to reinforce existing inequalities. First, we establish the link between the economic well-being and the network structure of US counties. We show that counties that are rich with long ties, those bridging different communities, have better outcomes over a range of economic indicators. Subsequently. we study the determinants of long ties and find that they are more frequent if the individual has experienced disruptions such as mobility, migration or switching schools throughout their life. Our findings suggest that creating and maintaining long ties require special skills that co-occur with the above mentioned life events. Second, we provide observational evidence for differential network advantages in access to information: higher status individuals receive higher marginal benefit from networking. We attribute this phenomena to unequal diffusion due to network homophily and provide causal evidence for it in the context of a randomized seeding experiment in networks. Third, we develop a network model that captures the structure of unequal diffusion or access to opportunities. We show that any departure from the uniform distribution of links to information sources in a group has both first order and second order effects. Not only some individuals will have fewer direct links, but also the whole group will have fewer diffusion paths to the information sources. Finally, we examine the network mechanisms that widen inter-group differences. We study an information sharing game, in which individuals have to compete for a rivalrous resource over repeated rounds. The equilibrium predicts lower cooperation among lower status agents, which leads the whole group to receive a ""a smaller share of the pie"". We further validate this prediction in an online lab experiment. We hope that our findings contribute to the growing literature around the network origins of persistent inequality. Our findings suggest that policies that target groups rather than individuals are more successful in combating inequality as the benefits that arise from lifting a whole group out of poverty will be amplified by the existing social capital and the feedback mechanisms present in the network.",2022,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Network effects on outcomes and unequal distribution of resources,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
X9TMSXAE,thesis,2012,"Machaka, Ronald",Ion Implantation into Boron Suboxide: Formation of Boron-Rich Structures and Related Phenomena,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/3152862928?pq-origsite=primo,"This thesis focuses on the boron suboxide B6O, a boron-rich super-hard ceramic material. With hardness values previously reported between 24 GPa and 45 GPa, B6O is one of the hardest known materials. Although first reports on boron suboxides date back as far as 1909 (Weintraub E., Transactions of the American Electrochemical Society, 16 (1909) 165), it is the B6O-based composites that have attracted considerable interest in recent years due to their enormous technological potential, especially as an alternative to polycrystalline diamond and polycrystalline cubic boron nitride for wear and abrasive applications. Investigations into the properties of B6O itself appear to have been neglected in favour of the improvement of densification and fracture toughness of the composites.The B6O samples used for the work reported in this work was hot-pressed was prepared under an argon environment at 1800 C and 50 MPa for 20 minutes followed metallographical preparation. The density of the hot-pressed compacts measured 2.44 g/cm3. The starting B6O powder material was supplied from the Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems, Dresden.This thesis primarily seeks to generate and report as much practical data for polycrystalline B6O materials prepared by uniaxial hot-pressing as possible from a variety of characterization techniques. Firstly, the Raman spectra of hot-pressed B6O, which was until now poorly understood, was investigated using using a 514.5 nm green Ar+ laser excitation source. Secondly, the fundamental nature of some mechanical properties of hot-pressed B6O were investigated by means of Vickers and Berkovich indentation techniques. New approaches for data analysis, especially the investigations of the nanomechanical properties of hot-pressed B6O by Berkovich nanoindentation, were also suggested. Thirdly, the intrinsic hardness of hot-pressed B6O was investigated by means of a comprehensive inter-model comparison study. Fourthly, a combined experimental and simulation approach for determining mechanical properties of hot-pressed B6O by nanoindentation was also carried out, based on the outcomes of the study, the deformation response of the material under dynamic indentation was investigated at different stages using a custom developed finite element model. Finally, based on the preliminary ab initio density functional calculations of the structural properties of B6O conducted by Lowther showing that the presence of a high electronegativity interstitial in the B6O structure could enhance the strength of the bonding in B6O, fluorine ion implantation into B6O were conducted. The effects to the structural and the nanomechanical properties of radiation damage induced by ion implantation was investigated. The possible formation of novel nanostructures in the ion-irradiated B6O matrix near-surface was also investigated.Results obtained from this study provides a vast amount of practical data for hot-pressed B6O materials as well as a number of novel analysis approaches for the extraction useful properties from the measured raw data. Firstly, using an automated background subtraction method, observable first- and second-order Raman spectra of B6O were obtained. A comparative analysis with previously reported spectra of other α-rhombohedral boron-rich ceramic materials demonstrate a good agreement. Results also confirm the existence of highly resolved Raman modes measured at ambient conditions using a green Ar+ excitation source which is contrary to the conventional understanding. Secondly, results from the micro-indentation investigations indicate the measured microhardness exhibits indentation load dependence. A model inter-comparison study of indentation size effects in the microhardness measurements of hot-pressed B6O is comprehensively discussed. Thirdly, the intrinsic hardness value of 30 GPa was deduced. Fourthly, a quantitative analysis approach was developed to simulate multi-cycling loading load-displacement curves from a single measured load-displacement nanoindentation curve. Based on the results, the nature of the indentation size effect in the nanoindentation hardness as well as the intrinsic nanomechanical properties of hot-pressed B6O were established. Fifthly, a combined experimental and finite element method simulation approach for determining mechanical properties of hot-pressed B6O by nanoindentation was developed. Based on the outcomes of the combined experimental and simulation studies, the deformation response of the material under dynamic indentation was also investigated at different stages using a custom developed finite element model. Finally, results from the structural characterization of the ion implanted B6O material demonstrates the formation of novel nanostructures by means of the ion bombardment of B6O. In addition, the study presented here also seeks to investigate the effects of the fluorine ion implantation on the near-surface nanomechanical properties of hot-pressed B6O.The principal conclusions that the study provide are both comprehensive practical data for B6O materials prepared by uniaxial hot-pressing. A number of properties, including the Raman spectra, the intrinsic hardness, and the radiation resistance and the effects of radiation damage are reported in the thesis.",2012,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,Ion Implantation into Boron Suboxide,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Ion Implantation into Boron Suboxide: Formation of Boron-Rich Structures and Related Phenomena ISBN: 9798346899501,,,,,Materials science; Nanoscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study uses a qualitative phenomenological method with a semi-structured interview to explore each individual's experience of the penal system. Eight participants who have successfully reentered society were interviewed. This study found that during incarceration, the penal system was perceived by participants as problematic in some way, leading to a desire to change. External support was found to be the primary external variable that contributes to successful reentry. This support was evidenced by others showing interest in participants as well as the availability of tangible resources (e.g., higher education, housing, or employment). All participants cited introspection and a deep commitment to change (as compared to desire alone) as helpful internal variables. The common phenomena identified by this researcher are 1) a significant identity shift either during incarceration or after release, 2) a marked change in thought process adopted by the participant, and 3) a drive to be altruistic after release. For this population, clinical implications include the need to focus treatment on the following: risk reduction, setting realistic goals, frustration tolerance, emotional regulation, individual strengths, understanding one's locus of control, and preparing for acculturation during reentry. Treatment for trauma and substance abuse should be available for those that need it, and when possible, incorporating family therapy and altruistic activities for individuals is strongly encouraged. Each participant spoke to the need for systemic change; better communication and collaboration is needed between prison staff, policymakers, healthcare professionals, law enforcement, and current and former inmates. Through access to improved resources for formerly incarcerated individuals after release, the hope is that crime rates and recidivism will reduce, and taxpayers will save money.",2011,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,Closing the Revolving Door,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Closing the Revolving Door: Variables that Contribute to Lower rates of Recidivism in Prisons in the United States ISBN: 9781124902357 ISSN: 0419-4217 Issue: 12 Pages: 7703 Volume: 72,,,,,Acculturation; Clinical psychology; Communication; Criminology; Imprisonment; Prisoners; Recidivism; Risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research explores several innovative potential solutions, specifically technology that optimizes the sequence of delivery vehicle parking and a novel “hitchhiking” operations concept for package delivery drones. In Chapters 2 and 3, this research investigates parking space schedule optimization through two modeling efforts, one which focuses on a system that receives all requests a day-ahead of time, and the second is a dynamic system that receives requests in real-time and periodically updates parking availability. Both of these studies see benefits from an optimized parking reservation system, but only under certain conditions. The best performance occurs when vehicle arrival time uncertainty is low and requests are received with sufficient lead time. When vehicle arrival uncertainty is high, however, parking schedules may require long buffers between reservations to accommodate late or early arrivals. Adding a buffer inherently reduces the time available for scheduling delivery vehicles and can result in more unscheduled vehicles than the first-come first-serve status quo.  In Chapter 4, this research assesses another technology solution, hitchhiking drones, where a drone lands and transits on a public bus while en-route to the destination, through a comparative analysis of other rapid package delivery methods in San Francisco. Results indicate that for rapid delivery of a single package to a destination, hitchhiking drones provide a competitive balance between speed and CO2 emissions relative to alternative modes such as car, e-bike, direct drone-only, and recharging drone delivery. As a result, if delivery stakeholders can accept a slightly longer delivery time, then hitchhiking drones can remove delivery vehicles from roadway traffic and provide meaningful CO2 savings.  Both of these technologies, parking space optimization and drone delivery strategies, are important potential components of urban logistics that can be beneficial and impactful when applied under the correct conditions. This research helps reveal the factors and conditions that make the technology the most competitive and which scenarios to avoid to prevent negative impacts",2024,5/20/25 15:59,5/20/25 15:59,5/20/25 15:59,78362808 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 78362808 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Aerospace Engineering; FOS: Mechanical engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The abstract reads: U.S federal  and state governments lacked a sufficiently complete, accurate and evolving picture of the  present state of critical manufacturing of medical supplies to respond effectively to COVID-19  and other pandemic emergencies. Government sources of firm data are useful to measure  economic activity and composition in a steady state but are not designed to capture rapid changes  during emergencies. Existing government surveys provide precise and accurate snapshots of U.S.  capabilities, but do not capture the rapidly evolving supply status during a crisis such as the  COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, government officials can make direct requests for information  from companies, they are poorly equipped to do frequent and comprehensive large-scale data  collection. To assess the consequences of this data gap, we used weekly web scraping from (May  30, 2020, to September 7, 2021) of Thomasnet -- a leading North American Manufacturing  industrial sourcing platform -- to develop a real-time and evolving list of firms that during the  pandemic’s most severe shortages self-identified as manufacturing domestically masks,  respirators, or their intermediate inputs. We then validate domestic location status and  manufacturing capabilities via firm websites, information from industry associations, data from  DB Hoovers, and interviews directly with companies. We conclude with new theory on how a  product’s entry costs, capital intensity of production, time to production and market,  technological complexity, and critically to national objectives may influence whether data on  v domestic production capacity of specific products should be collected not all, continuously  (semiconductors), or spun up during shortages (masks).  Paper 2 addresses the question of where are there opportunities for small and medium  sized firms to contribute to an industrial mobilization response? The abstract reads: This paper  investigates the role of short-term economic dynamism in responding to crisis induced supply  shortages. We focus on the domestic manufacturing ramp-up of surgical masks, respirators, and  their intermediary products in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We develop a novel method  for timely identification and validation of the evolving state of domestic manufacturing. To  unpack the activities of domestic manufacturers and related institutions, we triangulate across 56  qualitative interviews, certifications, Thomasnet.com®, industry associations, and other public  data. We find that while large manufacturers could rapidly scale up, onshore, or diversify  production to enter into domestic production of critical medical supplies, these large  manufacturers alone were insufficient to meet the spike in demand. In face of this shortage, small  and medium enterprises (SME), who entered into mask and respirator production as de novo  firms, spin-offs, and by diversifying, were important in increasing overall domestic capacity and  serving markets unmet by large hospital distributors. We propose new theory for how and when  federal and state governments should support short-term economic dynamism (firm entry into  target products and/or markets) during crises to address supply shortages, and the types of  market and network failures federal or state governments may be most effective at addressing.   Paper 3 highlights regional and industrial variation in manufacturing activity. The  abstract reads: We introduce a novel and nuanced measure of agglomeration with two  components that differentiate between horizontal (co-location with the own/peer industries) and  vertical (co-location with suppliers) agglomeration. Using employment and establishment data at the US county level and the six-digit industry level, we demonstrate that industries and regions  vary in their degree of vertical versus horizontal agglomeration, and only certain regions appear  to support high levels of both types of agglomeration. Moreover, we find that industry-level  differences in horizontal versus vertical agglomeration are correlated with industry  characteristics. Industries that rely more heavily on physical inputs are correlated with vertical  (supplier) agglomeration while more R&amp;D intensive industries are correlated with horizontal  (peer) agglomeration. These differences are overlooked with existing agglomeration measures.  This research offers important implications for regional and industrial policy interventions.",2024,5/20/25 16:00,5/20/25 16:00,5/20/25 16:00,11104356 Bytes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,Artwork Size: 11104356 Bytes Publisher: Carnegie Mellon University,,,,,Engineering not elsewhere classified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Daniel","Fuel, Feedstock, or Neither? – Evaluating Tradeoffs in the use of Biomass for Greenhouse Gas Mitigation",,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Fuel_Feedstock_or_Neither_Evaluating_Tradeoffs_in_the_use_of_Biomass_for_Greenhouse_Gas_Mitigation/6717413/1,"Biomass is the world’s largest renewable energy source, accounting for approximately 10% of global primary energy supply, and 5% of energy consumed in the United States. Prominent national programs like the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard incentivize increased use of biomass, primarily as a transportation fuel. There has been comparatively little government support for using biomass as a renewable feedstock for the chemical sector. Such asymmetry in incentives can lead to sub-optimal outcomes in the allocation of biomass toward different uses. Greenhouse gas reduction is among the most cited benefits of bioenergy and bio-based products, however, there is increasing controversy about whether increased use of biomass can actually contribute to greenhouse gas emission targets. If biomass is to play a role in current and future greenhouse gas mitigation efforts its use should be guided by efficient use of natural and economic resources. This thesis addresses these questions through a series of case studies, designed to highlight important tradeoffs in the use of biomass for greenhouse gas mitigation. Should biomass be used as a fuel, a chemical feedstock, or neither? The first case study in this thesis focuses on the ‘fuel vs feedstock’ question, examining the greenhouse gas implications of expanding the scope of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard to include credits for bioethylene, an important organic chemical readily produced from bioethanol. Results suggest that an expanded policy that includes bioethylene as an approved use for ethanol would provide added flexibility without compromising greenhouse gas targets – a clear win scenario. Having established that bioethylene based plastics can achieve similar greenhouse gas reductions to bioethanol used as fuel, this thesis expands the analysis by considering how the greenhouse gas emissions from a wider range of bio-based plastics compare to each of the main commodity thermoplastics produced in the U.S. The analysis demonstrates that there are large uncertainties involved in the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from bio-based plastics, and that only a subset of pathways are likely to be preferable to conventional plastics. The following chapter then builds on the existing model to compare the greenhouse gas mitigation potential of bio-based plastics to the potential for reducing emissions by adopting low carbon energy for plastics production. That chapter concludes that switching to renewable energy across the supply chain for conventional plastics energy cuts greenhouse gas emissions by 50-75%, achieving a greater reduction, with less uncertainty and lower cost, than switching to corn-based biopolymers – the most likely near-term biopolymer option. In the long run, producing bio-based plastics from advanced feedstocks (e.g. switchgrass) and/or with renewable energy likely offers greater emission reductions. Finally, this thesis returns to the dominant form of policy surrounding biomass use: biofuel mandates. That study takes a consequential approach to the ‘fuel or neither’ question. Specifically, this work examines how petroleum refineries are likely to adjust their production in response to biofuel policies, and what this implies for the success of these policies. The research demonstrates that biofuel policies induce a shift toward greater diesel production at the expense of both gasoline and non-combustion petroleum products. This has the potential to result in an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, even before accounting for the emissions from producing the biofuels themselves.",12/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:27,,,,,,,"Fuel, Feedstock, or Neither?",,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6717413.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike physical warnings, whose design and use is regulated by law and based on years of research, computer security dialogs are often designed in an arbitrary manner. We need scientific solutions to produce dialogs that users will heed and understand. Currently, we lack an understanding of the factors that drive users’ attention to security dialogs, and how to counteract habituation. Studying computer security behavior is difficult because a) users are more likely to expose themselves to risk in a lab experiment than in daily life, b) the size of observed effects is usually very small, which makes it necessary to collect many observations, and c) it is complex to balance research interests and the ethical duty not to harm. My thesis makes two contributions: a novel methodology to study behavioral responses to security dialogs in a realistic, ethical way with high levels of ecological validity, and a novel technique to increase and retain attention to security dialogs, even in the presence of habituation.",2/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,Improving Computer Security Dialogs,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6719972.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
XL6LATEA,thesis,2015,"Stein, Beth R.",Applications of Imaging Spectroscopy in Forest Ecosystems at Multiple Scales,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1991483318?pq-origsite=primo,"Forests provide a number of ecosystem services which sustain and enrich the wildlife, human societies, and the environment. However, many disturbances threaten forest ecosystems, making it necessary to monitor their health for optimal management and conservation. Although there are many indicators of forest health, changes in biogeochemical cycling, loss of species diversity, and invasive plants are particularly useful due to their vulnerability to the effects of climate change and intensive agricultural land use. Thus, this work evaluates the use of imaging spectroscopy to monitor forest nutrient status, species diversity, and plant invasions in the Mid- Atlantic region. The research is divided into four separate studies, each of which evaluated a unique application for imaging spectroscopy data at a different scale within the forest. The first two studies examined loblolly pine nutrient status at the leaf and canopy scales, respectively. The first study determined that loblolly pine foliar macronutrient concentrations can be successfully modeled across the Southeastern US (R2=0.39-0.74). Following on these results, the second study focused on the relationship between physical characteristics, reflectance, and nutrients. Reflectance values and W scattering coefficients produced successful nitrogen models across loblolly pine plots at the canopy scale. Regression models showed similar explanatory power for nitrogen, although W scattering coefficients were significantly correlated with nitrogen at multiple wavelengths and reflectance variables were not. However, the direction of some of the correlations with W and the unusually high directional area scattering factor values indicate a need for further experimentation. The third study found that several imaging spectroscopy algorithms were moderately successful in identifying wavyleaf basketgrass invasions in mixed deciduous forests (overall accuracy=0.35-0.78; kappa=0.41-0.53). Lastly, the fourth study used a novel imaging spectroscopy/lidar fusion to identify canopy gaps and measure species diversity of understory vegetation. The lidar algorithm identified 29 of 34 canopy gaps, and regression models explained 49 percent of the variance in gap species diversity. In conclusion, imaging spectroscopy can be used to evaluate ecosystem health through forest nutrient status, nitrogen models, species diversity estimates, and identification of invasive plant species.",2015,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Applications of Imaging Spectroscopy in Forest Ecosystems at Multiple Scales ISBN: 9780355348187,,,,,Remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim is to facilitate the discussion among companies and policy makers on the health, environmental, economic and operational feasibility aspects of low-carbon vehicles, such as BEV vans, electric cargo scooters, and electric and human-powered cargo bicycles; and to produce actionable insights for their decision making on the inclusion of these vehicles in city logistics fleets. The analysis is carried under both private and public perspectives and for six specific European capitals (Berlin, Paris, Rome, Lisbon, Oslo and London), characterized by diverse size, weather, topography, infrastructure, and economic and social conditions. Because of these differences, the insights of this study are valuable to other cities within and outside Europe.The second chapter explores costs and benefits of BEV very large vans compared to their diesel equivalent, performing a life cycle assessment and an annualized cost comparison. Different battery technologies are included in the assessment and the outputs served to model small vans and air pollutant emissions from vehicle productions of low-carbon vehicles based on their weight and battery sizes.The third chapter assesses the effects of temperature on operational feasibility and costs of large BEV (and diesel) vans to make Chapter 2 results more robust. The study finds that the operational costs of diesel and BEV vans due to temperature effect are relatively small when compared to the overall operational costs. Even when including the purchase of dedicated charging stations, large BEV van operational costs remain 40 to 80% lower than for large diesel vans. However, pre-heating large BEV vans can reduce their range limitations in cold cities by 5-10%, 90-95% and 100% for 23.4, 46.8 and 70.2 kWh battery sizes, respectively, while it has a small or no value in warm cities.The fourth chapter then shifts the focus to deliveries performed by small diesel vans and assesses small BEV vans, electric cargo scooters and cargo bicycles’ ability to replace small diesel vans. It also explores the effects of weather and topographic factors, such as temperature, wind and city hilliness, on low-carbon vehicle technologies’ operational feasibility frontiers, expressed in terms of distance and load. Results reveal that the baseline fleet of small diesel vans, and therefore its delivery trips and mileage, can be entirely replaced by 36 kWh small BEV vans, while two-wheeled vehicles have a more limited potential. When multiple cargo bicycles and electric cargo scooters are used to replace diesel van trips, they could replace up to 28-63% of the baseline small diesel vans, with 0.4 average load factor, and 24-62% of the baseline fleet mileage, depending on the characteristics of the city.Across the topographic and weather factors affecting riders’ energy use, “hilliness intensity” and “average wind speed,” are the most relevant ones. The first of the two is predictable, however it could increase energy use considerably. Based on empirical cargo bicycle rides’ data, this study founds this effect varies from 0% in Berlin and London to 37% in Lisbon. Wind speed effect is less predictable daily and its effect on two-wheeled vehicles’ energy use varies between 1% and 22%. Hence, electric cargo bicycles in hilly and windy cities like Lisbon would require a set of three 1 kWh batteries to operate the same number of delivery trips that are operationally feasible for 1 kWh electric cargo bicycles in a flat city like Berlin. Furthermore, results reveal that cargo bicycle riders’ “type of diet” is critical to determine whether their deliveries have lower carbon footprint than electric scooters and small BEV vans. When food is considered, human-powered cargo bicycles’ GHG emissions are also larger than for electric cargo bicycle models.In the fifth chapter, private and external costs of different vehicle options are discussed to assess their cost effectiveness and inform the strategies, and policy incentives, delivery companies and European cities will need to achieve increasing levels of the European Commission strategic goal of “CO2-free city logistics,” with and without including cargo vans, by 2030.Results reveal that, low-carbon vehicles are either able to reduce air pollution but not congestion external costs (small BEV vans), or reduce air pollution and congestion external costs, but increase road accident costs (cargo bicycles and electric scooters). The study finds that cities can reduce their city logistics external costs including low-carbon vehicles in their fleets by up to 57% in Berlin, to 45-43% in Paris and Rome, respectively, and 31% in Lisbon, and that these percentages are achievable by prioritizing the inclusion of two-wheeled vehicle options in low-carbon vehicle fleets. In addition, policy makers could award financial or non-financial incentives to low-carbon vehicle options to make them more economically attractive than small diesel vans. These incentives would be justified by external cost savings, which vary across cities and could be up to 500-1,600 EUR/year for small BEV vans, 2,400-6,000 EUR/year for electric cargo scooters and 3,900-7,700 EUR/year for cargo bicycles, allowing low-carbon vehicle options can fully replace small diesel van delivery operations.The study concludes that the European Commission can achieve the 2030 “CO2-free city logistics” goal by a combination of cargo bicycles, electric cargo scooters and BEV vans, and that prioritizing the inclusion of two-wheeled vehicles maximizes cities’ external cost savings. Importantly, future research should include real driving-cycle and monitor operational data, such as load factors and parcel density information, of vehicle technologies in city logistics fleets to reduce energy use uncertainty and improve operational feasibility and external cost estimates.",10/2/20,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/13008338.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/T9K7JGHZ/Giordano - 2020 - Environmental and Economic Prospects of Low-Carbon Vehicles in Support of European Commission 2030 C.pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem addressed in this qualitative case study was the need to understand the aging federal workforce and its effect on human capital. This study determined how the leaders of Air Force Base X (AFBX) [pseudonym] are addressing issues concerning the aging federal workforce. Data were collected using institutional records, interviews, and a researcher designed survey. General systems, open systems, and system thinking provided the theoretical frameworks for identifying systems archetypes. The participants included 118 federal employees and three military officers. An emergent strategy of thematic analysis was applied to combine, categorize, and code related patterns. Results indicated that AFBX leaders are managing human capital by initiating innovative and long-standing programs that: involve stakeholders; establish partnerships; build relationships; establish recruitment pipelines; invest in people; and perform long and short-range succession planning. However, the AFBX leaders are falling short in the areas of strategic alignment, knowledge management, and human capital accountability. The majority of federal employees in this study believed their leaders did not have a viable human capital strategy, and that their leaders are falling short in the areas of communication, talent management, and knowledge management. Recommendations were made to establish a central repository for human capital information, institute a scorecard system for measuring human capital programs, and encourage AFBX leaders to communicate and promote human capital strategies.

Access to reliable electricity and modem forms of energy for cooking can contribute to improvements in sectors beyond the energy industry such as health, education, commerce, and agriculture, and has been shown to correspond with poverty alleviation and economic growth. A successful strategy towards universal access requires a careful assessment of the diverse energy services needs from the perspective of the beneficiaries, the impact on their economic and social development, and the environmental consequences. This thesis proposes a comprehensive methodology for the assessment of the appropriate modes of electrification and heating and cooking for specific countries or regions. The software tools used for this analysis are incorporated in the proposed technology toolkit consisting of: the Reference Electrification Model (REM)-used to determine the appropriate modes of electrification (grid extension, micro or isolated systems) given the current base scenario; the Reference Cooking Model (RCM)-used to determine technology choices for the provision of modem heat for cooking; and the MASTER4all Model-used to evaluate the future macro level impact of different energy access strategies in a specific region or a country as a whole, taking into account various business scenarios and regulatory policies. While the analytical strategy presented here is intended to be generalizable for other regions, it is based on a case study of Kilifi County in Kenya.

The roots of this problem lie in systemic racism and segregated schools. The overwhelming majority of economically disadvantaged African American high school students at segregated schools receive substandard mathematics education. One part of this study consists of analysis of Chicago Public Schools (CPS) data, showing vast inequities in the education delivered to the 72% of African American CPS students who attend segregated schools. Data from interviews of 24 freshmen in low-level algebra classes at one such CPS school support the major part of this study. The interviewees answer questions about their experiences as mathematics students and as African Americans. Results of this study found students to be teacher dependent, to approach math lessons as unconnected to previous knowledge, and to take a narrow view towards the value of mathematics. Students had not encountered autonomous learning in mathematics, learned to approach difficult problems with confidence and perseverance nor experienced the joy of solving a challenging problem. While students are aware of racism's existence, they are unclear about how it affects them directly. Students do not recognize that the segregated schools and neighborhoods of their lives are a result of racism. They accept their substandard education as normal and are uncritical of their schools. Students repeat anti-Black stereotypes about fellow students in relation to violence, interest in education, and self-responsibility. Mathematics educators need to be aware of the social context of math education. Segregated, economically disadvantaged African American students are likely to have learned teacher-dependence and narrow approaches to mathematics. It is therefore crucial that teachers develop lessons and practices aimed at moving students in the opposite direction, to become independent conceptual thinkers. This is no simple task, particularly for students who have developed these practices over many years of school. Researchers can prioritize the development of autonomy-building, conceptually based lessons and practices and school systems can support teachers' collaborative efforts in this regard.

XSL9D49K,thesis,2015,"Collins, Ross D.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Using inclusive wealth as a measure of sustainability for infrastructure planning and evaluation,,,,,,"Inclusive wealth (IW) measures the productive base of an economy, which is a linear index of its capital asset stocks. Changes to IW per capita over time track changes to intergenerational human well-being, thus non-declining IW per capita indicates sustainable development. National IW has only been measured retrospectively; this dissertation models and projects IW prospectively, measuring the impact of alternative infrastructure plans on IW. The focus of the work is on electricity planning in oil-exporting countries. Domestic oil consumption in these countries, driven by increasing electricity use, threatens long-term development by reducing the export revenue on which the government and economy depends. First, I develop a system dynamics model that connects electric power capacity expansion with macroeconomic development, tabulating both infrastructure costs and impacts to the capital stocks of IW over time. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is the primary case study. Second, I analyze the capital stock projections generated by the model across a range of scenarios and countries. Under the baseline IW formulation, KSA experiences a negative annual growth rate to inclusive wealth per capita to 2050. However, adjusted formulations allow the possibility of periods of positive growth, and a non-oil sector that is less dependent on the oil sector will shift the IW trajectory upwards. Compared to KSA, Kuwait is likely to experience larger per capita declines in IW. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), on the other hand, will potentially experience positive growth rates in per capita IW starting in 2028. Third, I analyze the IW impacts of non-fossil investments in electricity infrastructure, specifically nuclear and solar, between now and 2050. In KSA, the produced capital benefits of non-fossil investment outweigh the oil capital costs (to finance the infrastructure) across a range of uncertainties. Including human capital benefits raises net benefits by an order of magnitude. The optimal allocation of nuclear and solar power ultimately depends on the evaluation metric used. The UAE gains least from non-fossil investment, since it uses comparatively less oil in its electricity system, while Kuwait experiences gains similar to KSA. Importantly, using IW as the basis for electricity policy evaluation yields qualitatively different prescriptions than a least-cost capacity expansion model.",2015,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 Ph.D.,Book Title: Using inclusive wealth as a measure of sustainability for infrastructure planning and evaluation,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Spring 2014, a large outbreak of MERS originated in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - concentrated in nosocomial settings in Riyadh and Jeddah - resulting in over 300 infections. We used publicly available data from the Saudi Ministry of Health and World Health Organization to examine the outbreak potential of MERS-Coronavirus and to explore possible risk factors for MERS-related mortality within the context of Saudi Arabia. We also investigated how differential case characteristics between patients reported during the Spring 2014 Saudi MERS outbreak and those reported during non-outbreak periods may provide insight into the propagation of future outbreaks. We found that the Spring 2014 Saudi MERS outbreak was likely due to a super-spreading event, in which a small fraction of cases caused the vast majority of secondary transmissions. Though most cases infected 1 or fewer other individuals, propensity for super-spreading suggests that the outbreak potential of MERS-Coronavirus is significant and that future outbreaks of similar size are expected to occur. Furthermore, we found that early administration of supportive care may be essential to survival once an individual is infected with MERS-Coronavirus; this is especially true for the elderly, who are at increased risk of death. Thus, surveillance - especially among the elderly, who are at increased risk for MERS-related death - is key to reducing fatality. Surveillance is also integral to detecting zoonotic introduction (i.e. host-to-human transmission) events that may trigger future outbreaks if left uncontained. Finally, we found that female and non-comorbid individuals were preferentially infected during the Spring 2014 outbreak, which may lend insight into the enabling conditions that are necessary for MERS outbreaks to emerge and propagate. Further exploration of the mechanisms that result in the zoonotic introduction of MERS-Coronavirus into the human population - as well as the emergence and propagation of MERS outbreaks - is crucial. As demonstrated by the steady stream of sporadic cases that have been reported since the Spring 2014 outbreak, MERS has already gained a firm foothold in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Given that Saudi Arabia is a universal religious travel destination, localized outbreaks may have massive global implications. Because of this, we conclude with the recommendation that the Saudi government should immediately prioritize systematic outbreak planning, preparedness, and prevention. Developing an early warning system (EWS) for MERS in Saudi Arabia using engineering systems modeling methods - namely, system dynamics - may help achieve these ends. If successfully within the context of MERS-Coronavirus in Saudi Arabia, such a modeling framework may also be generalized to other zoonotic pathogens with similar emergent properties and global ramifications.",2015,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia : insights from publicly available data,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The success of education technologies in schools depends on both the quality of the material presented through technology in terms of content and pedagogy and also the quality of the implementation of the program. With the acknowledgement that high quality materials are essential to the success of any technology, this thesis is concerned with the implementation of technology programs in schools, as it is impossible to utilize the technology for learning gains when students or teachers cannot access the materials. Prior research in education technology has not addressed readiness or planning practices for such large-scale programs as they exist today, specifically for 1:1 initiatives (""1:1"" describes a system in which all students have personal learning devices, such as tablets or laptops). The main objective of this thesis is to determine the best practices in preparedness and planning for large-scale technology initiatives in US high schools. The research is designed to aid school system administrators and policy makers in their technology decision-making processes through the creation of a rubric of metrics and a model for sustainable implementation. The rubric and model were informed by data gathered through a case study approach, focusing on schools that are currently implementing 1:1 initiatives. The rubric outlines a spectrum of potential readiness levels across a number of critical metrics and allows school leaders to self-assess their readiness for a 1:1 program. In addition to the rubric and sustainable implementation model, this thesis aims to determine best practices in planning for a 1:1 program. Through a second round of case studies and interviews with school leaders, past planning practices and gaps in knowledge and planning were examined. From the school leaders' reflections on best practices, conclusions for improvement of current planning tools were drawn. These improvements include the creation of mentor relationships for schools and the use of a thorough, yet simple, needs assessment that includes detailed timeline for implementation. Both the readiness rubric and the study of planning practices led to a number of policy recommendations not only for schools, but for all levels of government in support of effective technology use in education.",2015,5/22/25 18:24,5/22/25 18:24,,,,,,,,Evaluating readiness for technology in schools,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2015 S.M.,Book Title: Evaluating readiness for technology in schools : developing planning tools and critical metrics to prepare for 1: 1 programs,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fostering this interest must occur before students reach college, and substantial efforts have been made to engage students at K-12 levels in STEM-focused learning. Attempts to involve students in engineering, a vital and growing profession, yet one in which students often have little experience, have frequently emphasized the design and construction of physical products, a practice supported by project-based learning. This thesis examines the environment of an engineering high school course that employed the project-based model. The course is part of a dedicated curricular program which aims to provide students with positive experiences in engineering-related activities while also preparing them for the rigors of college. A case study was conducted to provide insight into the benefits and drawbacks of the learning model. The study's outcomes are intended to provide guidance to educators participating in the design and/or facilitation of project-based activities, particularly those involved with engineering education. The research was performed using a qualitative approach. Long-term engagement with course participants was deemed critical to gaining a comprehensive understanding of the interactions and events that transpired on a daily basis. Nine educators involved with the program were interviewed, as were nineteen of the course's thirty-nine students. A wealth of other relevant data -- including surveys, field notes, and evaluations of student work -- was compiled for analysis as well. The study findings suggest that experiences in problem solving and teamwork were the central benefits of the course. Limitations existed due to a high focus on hands-on work, which infringed upon the significance of math and science content as well as the utilization of disciplined inquiry. In addition, group projects failed to hold individuals accountable, leading to assessment challenges. Program-wide, a number of issues hindered the teachers' abilities to institute changes, most notably a commitment to serve students of all abilities.",2015,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,5/22/25 18:26,,,,,,,Project-based learning in a high school engineering program,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,Ann Arbor,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Project-based learning in a high school engineering program: A case study ISBN: 9781339035734,,,,,Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The electric sector has been taking steps to reform the grid, retiring carbon-intensive coal plants, increasing renewable penetration, and introducing cyber elements end-to-end for monitoring, estimating, and controlling devices, systems, and markets. Due to retirements of coal plants, discovery of shale gas leading to low natural gas prices, and geopolitical motives to reduce dependence on foreign oil, natural gas is becoming a major fuel source for electricity around the United States. In addition, with increasingly intermittent renewable sources in the grid, there is a need for a readily available, clean, and flexible back-up fuel; natural gas is sought after in New England to serve this purpose as a reliable and guaranteed fuel in times when wind turbines and solar panels cannot produce. While research has been conducted advocating natural gas pipeline expansion projects to ensure this reliability, not enough attention has been paid to the overall market structure in the natural gas and electricity infrastructures which can also impact reliable delivery of gas and therefore efficient interdependency between the two infrastructures. This thesis explores the market structures in natural gas and electricity, the interdependence of natural gas and electricity prices with increasing reliance on natural gas as the penetration of renewable energy resources (RER) increases in order to complement their intermittencies, possible volatilities in these prices with varying penetration rates in RER, and alternatives to existing market structures that improve reliability and reduce volatility in electricity and gas prices. In particular, the thesis will attempt to answer the following two questions: What will the generation mix look like in 2030 and how will this impact gas and electricity prices? How do Gas-Fired Generator (GFG) bids for gas change between 2015 and 2030? In order to answer these questions, a computational model is determined using regression analysis tools and an auction model.

Both pollutants significantly impact human health and welfare, so National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have been established for each. As of 2013, over 100 million people in the U.S. lived in areas with ozone concentrations above the NAAQS. NOx emissions from the power sector, roughly 12% of total NOx emissions, are and will be significant contributors to ozone concentrations in the U.S. As such, states have reduced peak ozone concentrations through technology-based standards and cap-and-trade programs on NOx emissions from the power sector. These policies have largely treated NOx emissions uniformly. But marginal damages from NOx emissions are greatest on hot sunny days when meteorological conditions favor high ozone formation rates and, consequently, peak ozone concentrations. This thesis informs what type of policy is the most efficient for reducing peak ozone concentrations on high ozone days by assessing the cost-effectiveness of three policies for reducing NOx emissions on high ozone days. Emissions and costs under a relatively-novel differentiated policy, time-differentiated pricing, are compared for the first time to two currently-implemented undifferentiated policies, cap-and-trade and technology-based standards. Two power systems are studied, Texas and the Mid-Atlantic. A unique two-phase model is developed to capture the short- (re-dispatching) and long-term (control technology installation) effects of pricing schemes on power plants. The two-phase model dispatches generators with a unit commitment model, which, unlike past studies, captures real-world operational constraints of generators that may strongly influence emissions and costs under time-differentiated pricing. Technology-based standards are simulated via Monte Carlo analysis to capture the uncertain rule-making process. For reducing NOx emissions on high ozone days in both power systems, time-differentiated pricing is shown to be the most cost-effective policy with regards to producer and consumer costs. Most emissions reductions are due to substitution of gas- for coal-fired generators, as control technology installations are only observed at very high time-differentiated prices. For reducing summer-wide NOx emissions, undifferentiated pricing is the most cost-effective. In a minority of allocations, technology-based standards also achieve more cost-effective summer-wide reductions than time-differentiated pricing, but such allocations cannot be guaranteed ex ante. These results suggest that time-differentiated pricing is the most efficient policy for reducing peak ozone concentrations, depending on ozone formation rates.",2014,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,Reducing the contribution of the power sector to ground-level ozone pollution,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2014 S.M.,Book Title: Reducing the contribution of the power sector to ground-level ozone pollution : an assessment of time-differentiated pricing of nitrogen oxide emissions,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This thesis models one of several early-stage post-combustion CO2 capture technologies, solid sorbent-based CO2 capture process, and presents performance and cost estimates of this system on pulverized coal power plants. The spreadsheet-based software package Microsoft Excel was used in conjunction with AspenPlus modelling results and the Integrated Environmental Control Model to develop performance and cost estimates for the solid sorbent-based CO2 capture technology. A reduced order model also was created to facilitate comparisons among multiple design scenarios. Assumptions about plant financing and utilization, as well as uncertainties in heat transfer and material design that affect heat exchanger and reactor design were found to produce a wide range of cost estimates for solid sorbent-based systems. With uncertainties included, costs for a supercritical power plant with solid sorbent-based CO2 capture ranged from $167 to $533 per megawatt hour for a first-of-a-kind installation (with all costs in constant 2011 US dollars) based on a 90% confidence interval. The median cost was $209/MWh. Post-combustion solid sorbent-based CO2 capture technology is then evaluated in terms of the potential cost for a mature system based on historic experience as technologies are improved with sequential iterations of the currently available system. The range costs for a supercritical power plant with solid sorbent-based CO2 capture was found to be $118 to $189 per megawatt hour with a nominal value of $163 per megawatt hour given the expected range of technological improvement in the capital and operating costs and efficiency of the power plant after 100 GW of cumulative worldwide experience. These results suggest that the solid sorbent-based system will not be competitive with currently available liquid amine-systems in the absence of significant new improvements in solid sorbent properties and process system design to reduce the heat exchange surface area in the regenerator and cross-flow heat exchanger. Finally, the importance of these estimates for policy makers is discussed.",11/1/15,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6714866.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessments of carbon sequestration resources that have been made for North America using existing methodologies likely underestimate uncertainty and variability in the reservoir parameters. This thesis describes a geostatistical model developed to estimate the CO2 storage resource in sedimentary formations. The proposed stochastic model accounts for the spatial distribution of reservoir properties and is implemented to a case study of the Oriskany Formation of the Appalachian sedimentary basin. The developed model allows for estimation of the CO2 sequestration resource of a storage formation with subsequent uncertainty analysis. Since the model is flexible with respect to changing input parameters and assumptions it can be parameterized to calculate the CO2 storage resource of any porous subsurface unit. The thesis continues with evaluation of the cost of CO2 injection and storage for the Oriskany Formation utilizing storage resource estimates generated by our geostatistical model. Our results indicate that the cost of sequestering CO2 has significant spatial variation due to heterogeneity of formation properties and site geology. We identify the low-cost areas within the Oriskany footprint. In general, these areas correspond to the deepest portions of the Appalachian basin and could be considered as potential CO2 injection sites for CCS industrial scale projects. Overall, we conclude that significant improvement can be made by integrating basin geology and spatial heterogeneity of formation petrophysical properties into CCS cost assessments, and that should be a focus of future research efforts. This will allow for more accurate cost estimates for the entire CCS system and identify areas of sedimentary basins with optimal conditions for CO2 injection and storage. To mitigate the effects of climate change, the U.S. will need a widespread deployment of low-carbon electricity generating technologies including natural gas and coal with CCS. More precise CO2 storage resource and CCS cost estimates will provide better recommendations for government and industry leaders and inform their decisions on what greenhouse gas mitigation measures are the best fit for their regions.",2/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715919.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most previous works rely on descriptive statistics obtained from place-based case studies representing major cities, metropolitan areas, and counties using emissions inventories that may have inconsistent and/or limited scope (e.g., transportation and residential emissions only). This limits the potential for general insights and decision support related to the role of urbanization in CO2 emissions reduction. Here, I implement generalized linear and multiple linear regression analyses to obtain robust insights on the relationship between urbanization and CO2 emissions in the U.S. I used consistently derived county-level scope 1 & 2 CO2 inventories for my response variable while predictor variables included dummy-coded variables for county geographic type (central, outlying, and non-metropolitan), median household income, population density, and climate indices (heating degree days (HDD) and cooling degree days (CDD)). There is statistically significant difference in per capita emissions by sector for different county types, with transportation and residential emissions highest in nonmetropolitan (rural) counties, transportation emissions lowest in central (most urbanized) counties, and commercial sector emissions highest in central counties. More importantly, contrary to most previous findings, there is not enough statistical evidence indicating that per capita scope 1 & 2 emissions differ by geographic type, ceteris paribus. These results are robust for different assumed electricity emissions factors. Given that emissions production rate in more urban counties are not significantly different from that of less urban ones and population is concentrated in urban counties, significant national emissions reduction could be achieved if efforts are focused on central counties. There are various climate mitigation techniques – both from the supply and demand side. Given the large contribution of transportation in total county emissions and the fact that this technology bridges the transportation and electricity sector which is currently the biggest contributor to CO2 emissions, I investigated the emission reduction benefits from driving electric instead of gasoline vehicles. Vehicle electrification has also received sustained support from the local to the supranational level and is seeing an optimistic market trend. I characterize and assess the uncertainty in CO2 emissions per mile travelled for vehicles in the U.S. given regional variation and uncertainty in electricity emissions factor (marginal vs average, generation- vs consumption-based, different regional boundaries), driving pattern, and daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT). I also investigate vehicle emissions estimates under convenience (vehicle starts charging when it arrives at home) and delayed (vehicle starts charging at 12am) charging. Using marginal emissions factors results in electric vehicle emissions estimate that are higher than average emissions estimates in the northeastern and north central U.S., and lower emissions in the south central U.S. In other regions, using marginal emissions versus average emissions factors may lead to differences in emissions estimates by as much as 28%. Delayed charging leads to higher emissions, given that off-peak electricity demand is supplied by fossil generators in most regions (e.g., coal). Using marginal emissions estimates, the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle has lower operation emissions compared to the Toyota Prius (the most efficient US gasoline vehicle) in western U.S., and the Leaf has higher operation emissions in the north central, regardless of assumed charging scheme and estimation method. In other regions the comparison is uncertain because of regional variation and uncertainty in emission factor estimates. Consumption- and generation-based marginal emissions also significantly (5 % - 28%), enough to result unclear comparison results. Average vehicle emissions estimates under different regional boundary definitions also differ significantly (e.g., state-based estimates deviate from National Electricity Reliability Commission (NERC) region-based estimates by as much as 122%). Other factors such as driving pattern and daily vehicle miles traveled also influence vehicle emissions. I conduct a locational comparison of electric and gasoline vehicle life cycle emissions in the U.S. taking into consideration the regional variation in the joint effect of consumption-based marginal electricity emission factors, driving pattern (city, highway or combined), and daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT) distribution. I find that electricity generation emissions rate, determined by grid mix and charging scheme, has the largest influence on electric vehicle emission levels and the emissions differences of gasoline and electric vehicles. Secondary to this is urbanization level, especially for PHEVs, as it influences driving pattern and daily vehicle miles traveled. Highest CO2 emission reductions from electric vehicles can be attained in metropolitan counties in CA, TX, FL, NY, and New England states. Policies for wider adoption of electric vehicles such as incentives and other adoption facilitating mechanisms including investments in public charging infrastructure are encouraged in metropolitan counties, especially the denser ones. On the other hand, these policies are discouraged in north central states where electric vehicles would only increase emissions because of a relatively carbon-intensive grid. These findings reflect the pivotal role of the electricity and transportation sectors nexus in achieving national goals of CO2 emission reductions. Unless the U.S. decarbonizes its electricity system further, electric vehicles will only be beneficial in climate mitigation efforts in certain locations in the country.",12/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,Urbanization and Vehicle Electrification in the United States,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6724184.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this same vital source suffers from various challenges. On social media platforms, such as Twitter, users do not necessarily face a lack of information; instead, they are overwhelmed with diverse information sources. These myriad sources of information on social media can make users unknowingly confined to or associated with other users or groups. Moreover, facts or news can be reported in ways that createconfusion and affect public sentiment on scientific actualities. Such social media challenges can cause a long-lasting impact in reshaping our society, slowing downscientific progress, and dampen regulatory endeavors. Thus, social media’s impact on socio-political and economic topics must be analyzed. In this thesis, I analyze each of these problems using conversations and news articles about one of the most significant challenges our society faces today, i.e., climate change. In my first study, I analyze climate change discussions on Twitter to study users confined to competing belief groups. I classify Twitter account users into: (a) users who believe in the anthropogenic cause of climate change (Believers); and (b) users who don’t (Disbelievers). I study the differences in communication topics and network structure in Disbelievers and Believers. I find that both Disbelievers and Believers talk within their group more than with the other group; this is more so thecase for Disbelievers than for Believers. In my second study, I develop a framework to quantify hostile communication between Believers and Disbelievers. I show that Disbelievers of climate change are more hostile towards Believers than vice versa. I examined the framing bias of climate change news articles shared on Twitter as partof my third study. I find that climate change news articles are predominantly framed as related to policy issues in the context of a social group’s traditions, customs, or values. Finally, I explore the spread of conspiracy theories in climate change conversations on Twitter. Results suggest that Disbelievers are primarily responsible for sharing messages that contain keywords related to conspiracy theories.

YF9SPRFM,thesis,2015,"France, Todd",Project-based learning in a high school engineering program: A case study,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1719261207?pq-origsite=primo,"Generating greater student interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has been a major topic of discussion among educators, policymakers, and researchers in recent years, as increasing the number of graduates in these fields is widely considered a necessary step for sustaining the progress of today's society. Fostering this interest must occur before students reach college, and substantial efforts have been made to engage students at K-12 levels in STEM-focused learning. Attempts to involve students in engineering, a vital and growing profession, yet one in which students often have little experience, have frequently emphasized the design and construction of physical products, a practice supported by project-based learning. This thesis examines the environment of an engineering high school course that employed the project-based model. The course is part of a dedicated curricular program which aims to provide students with positive experiences in engineering-related activities while also preparing them for the rigors of college. A case study was conducted to provide insight into the benefits and drawbacks of the learning model. The study's outcomes are intended to provide guidance to educators participating in the design and/or facilitation of project-based activities, particularly those involved with engineering education. The research was performed using a qualitative approach. Long-term engagement with course participants was deemed critical to gaining a comprehensive understanding of the interactions and events that transpired on a daily basis. Nine educators involved with the program were interviewed, as were nineteen of the course's thirty-nine students. A wealth of other relevant data -- including surveys, field notes, and evaluations of student work -- was compiled for analysis as well. The study findings suggest that experiences in problem solving and teamwork were the central benefits of the course. Limitations existed due to a high focus on hands-on work, which infringed upon the significance of math and science content as well as the utilization of disciplined inquiry. In addition, group projects failed to hold individuals accountable, leading to assessment challenges. Program-wide, a number of issues hindered the teachers' abilities to institute changes, most notably a commitment to serve students of all abilities.",2015,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,Project-based learning in a high school engineering program,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,Ann Arbor,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Project-based learning in a high school engineering program: A case study ISBN: 9781339035734,,,,,Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It tests the value of this mixed method for modeling the multiplicity of inputs and complexity of feedback loops that affect the cost, schedule and performance of satellite constellations within the Department of Defense. The resulting simulation enables direct comparison of the effect of changing architectural design points and policy choices with respect to satellite acquisitions and fielding. A generation-over-generation examination of policy choices is made possible through the application of soft systems modeling of experience and learning effects. The resulting model enables examination of possible futures given variations in assumptions about both internal and external forces on a satellite production pipeline. This thesis performs a policy analysis examining the current path of the Global Positioning System acquisition and compares it to equivalent position navigation and timing capability delivered through a variety of disaggregated options while varying: design lives, production quantities, non-recurring engineering and time between generations. The extensibility of this technique is investigated by adapting the model to the mission area of Weather and Climate Sensing. This thesis then performs a policy analysis examining different disaggregated approaches for the Joint Polar Satellite, focusing on the impact of complexity.

YHE8BFG9,thesis,2015,"Grohs, Jacob Richard",Developing a Measure of Systems Thinking Competency,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1898761286?pq-origsite=primo,"Institutions of higher education often promise to graduate individuals capable not only of excelling in their area of expertise but also qualified as exceptional leaders and citizens. Yet, what are the competencies needed from leaders in order to address the most challenging issues facing society? How would higher education cultivate the next generation of leaders for a world of problems we currently cannot solve, and how would it be determined if some graduates were ""more prepared"" than others to face these challenges? This dissertation seeks to answer these questions through the work of two distinct manuscripts. The first argues that human processes for meaning-making play critical formative roles in the setting and solving of our most complex problems. In essence, that problem-solving can be considered as embodied acts of meaning-making. This link is made through analysis of Bruner's concept of narrative and highlights the importance played by naming and framing through one's unique perspective while attempting to interpret an ill-structured problem. The second manuscript develops a tool to measure ""systems thinking,"" a competency that describes the sort of cognitive flexibility that might be beneficial for graduates to be emerging leaders capable of addressing critical societal issues. A framework for considering systems thinking competency is presented and used as the foundation of a scenario-based assessment tool. Results from a qualitative pilot study are shown as part of introducing the tool with primary findings: (a) the tool elicited meaningful data on each of the constructs for which it was designed; (b) emergent within each construct were possible means of characterizing the data that will allow for future study of variation across respondents.

Two years later, in 2014, the President outlined 19 new executive actions to improve the lives of service members with a focus on improving access to mental health care. These actions placed a priority on improving the capacity to provide mental health care. This thesis examines ways of improving the capacity of the mental health system with a focus on system redesign. I review capacity planning, provide a literature review of simulation methods and present a simulation, and data analysis of Site Alpha, a U.S. Army Installation. I also use causal loop diagrams to explore other feasible scenarios that affect care capacity. The key take-away from this work is that system inefficiencies should be dealt with before more resources can be effectively added and used in the system. Another pertinent finding is that the distribution of the providers in the system should be improved. The system also contains high utilizer patients who must be considered when planning for care. The mental health system is extremely complex and risks becoming even more complex.

While the earliest programs of its kind were initiated about a decade ago, we still lack empirical evidence on its effectiveness. Using the detailed dataset of the gap-funding program at MIT, the Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, I observe two mechanisms that gap-funding program can facilitate academic commercialization. First, by providing research funding that allows academic freedom of problem selection and mode of disclosure, gap-funding program attracts applications from junior faculty members with commercialization interests. Second, providing research funding for prototype development and networking opportunities with industry practitioners increases the likelihood that an academic invention results in start-up founding. Moreover, its positive impact is larger for inventions without intellectual property rights protection, partly because of the reduced level of uncertainty after prototype development. However, awarding gap-funding does not increase the likelihood of technology licensing to incumbent firms. Together, I argue that gap-funding program can be a useful policy toolkit for regional economic development by fostering academic entrepreneurship.",2013,5/22/25 18:22,5/22/25 18:22,,,,,,,,Bridging the innovation gap through funding,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2013 S.M.,Book Title: Bridging the innovation gap through funding : the case of MIT Deshpande Center,,,,,Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation (Massachusetts Institute of Technology),,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YJILEXDZ,thesis,2014,"Zaber, Moinul I.",The Influence of Institutional Structure on Regulatory Choices and the Impact of these Choices on the Telecommunication Marketplace,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/The_Influence_of_Institutional_Structure_on_Regulatory_Choices_and_the_Impact_of_these_Choices_on_the_Telecommunication_Marketplace/6723626/1,"The telecommunications regulatory authorities are separate independent bodies equipped with people with the knowledge of the technology and the economics of the sector and endowed with certain statutory power to oversee the market. In different countries these sector specific organizations are different in terms of structure, scope and level of independence. Nonetheless, these independent regulatory authorities (IRA) take various decisions that are often proved to be vital to change the course of the specific sector. This research aims to understand what influences the regulatory decisions and how the decisions impact the course of the sector. Mobile telephony and Internet revolutionized the telecommunication marketplace since early 1990s. Better technology made transfer of real time voice and video transfer via Internet affordable and ubiquitous. The need for spectrum increased as the use of mobile data increased. Traditional regulatory regimes recognize ‘voice’ and ‘data’ to be distinct services. With Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), this regulatory notion is gradually becoming obsolete. Now wired, wireless and Internet based telecom services are competing in the voice telephony market. With competition, customers are migrating to newer, cheaper and better quality services. The barrier to this free movement is the absence of number portability- customer’s ability to keep the phone number when she migrates from the existing service provider to a better alternative. The regulators are now facing new challenges –legalization of VoIP, introduction of mobile number portability, decisions to award electromagnetic spectrum via auction, legalization of reusing specific spectrum band and mandating neutrality of technology for specific technology generations. Broadly, these regulatory choices can be divided into three categories- decision to introduce new technology (legalization of Voice over IP), decision to enhance competition (introduction of mobile number portability) and decision to manage scarce resources efficiently (spectrum related decisions). This thesis is a novel addition to the anthology of telecommunication regulation, technology policy, institutional economics and political science. Theoretical works that explain the dynamics of the regulatory institutions and their decisions are in abundance. However, quantitative scrutiny is scarce. We try to fill the gap through empirical research. We ascertain how over all politicoregulatory environment impact certain regulatory decisions, and how these decisions impact diffusion of a certain technology generation, price of telephony and the country’s economic growth. The dataset is of time-series-cross-sectional form consisting of 145 countries of the world. It contains information regarding political conditions (such as system of the governments, parliament, regulatory design (such as composition of the institution, independence, functions), socio-economic condition (such as income level), and communication-market specific data (such as various regulatory decisions, sector performance indicators). With the help of the dataset, this thesis ascertains firstly the impact of the institutional environment on the regulatory choices and secondly the impact of these choices on the marketplace. Our estimations find that in the telecommunications sector, it is not the over all political condition but the construct of the regulatory structure-independence and scope that enables the regulators to take decisions in favor of technologies and interventions that may be paradigm shifting and disruptive. We find that the decisions related to spectrum management, have positive impact on diffusion. However, the ‘one size fit all solution’ does not work well as in terms of consumer price and GDP growth, influence of these interventions affect the countries of different economic level and geopolitical locations differently. We also find evidence that, whilst the institutions impact various regulatory decisions which in turn impact the diffusion of technologies, the variables of the institutions do not have direct influence on the diffusion process.",12/1/14,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723626.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To do this, STPA was used to analyze a case study involving Naval Offshore Supply Vessels (OSV) that incorporate software-intensive dynamic positioning in support of target vessel escort operations. The analysis begins by analyzing the OSVs in the context of the Navy's organizational structure and then delves into assessing the functional relationship between OSV system components that can lead to unsafe control and the violation of existing safety constraints. The results of this analysis show that STPA found all of the component failures identified through independently conducted traditional safety analyses of the OSV system. Furthermore, the analysis shows that STPA finds many additional safety issues that were either not identified or inadequately mitigated through the use of Fault Tree Analysis and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis on this system. While showing the benefit of STPA through this case study, other general advantages that STPA has relative to traditional safety analysis techniques are also discussed. First, this thesis discusses how STPA generates results that are completely compliant with the requirements for system hazard analysis set forth in MIL-STD-882E and that STPA more completely satisfies the tasks in MIL-STD-882E than traditional safety analysis techniques. Next, the link between STPA and Causal Analysis using Systems Theory- (CAST), two Systems Theoretic Application and Model Processes (STAMP) tools is discussed to highlight how using STPA for hazard analysis benefits subsequent accident investigations using the CAST framework.",2016,5/22/25 18:29,5/22/25 18:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Engineering, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis IDSS 2016 S.M.,Book Title: Systems Theoretic Process Analysis applied to an Offshore Supply Vessel dynamic positioning system,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the implementation of climate regulations, the viability of different technologies will begin to change as decreased emissions begin to be incentivized. This thesis addresses how proposed climate regulations necessitating use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) will affect water use from new fossil-fuel fired power generation as well as how climate changes and policies could affect water use from the electricity generation sector on the whole in the long term. This thesis also addresses the economic viability of existing coal-fired power plants using carbon capture and storage (CCS) retrofits under the impending market structure of the finalized Clean Power Plan. Chapter 1 examines the water use impacts of the proposed New Source Performance Standards for CO2 emissions new fossil fuel-fired electricity generation units proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in September 2013. To meet the emissions requirements of this regulation, coal-fired units will require use of CCS at 40% capture, increasing water use by approximately 30%, though added water use varies with plant and CCS designs. More stringent standards could require CCS at natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants as well. When examined over a range of emission standards, new NGCC plants consume roughly 60 to 70% less water than coal-fired plants. Chapter 2 quantifies plant and regional shifts in water consumption from the energy generation sector in light of ambient climate changes and potential regulation shifts from climate mitigation policies on a 100-year planning horizon in the Southwest. Employing an integrated modeling framework, feedbacks between climate change, air temperature and humidity, and v consequent power plant water requirements are assessed. These direct impacts of climate change on water consumption by 2095 range from a 3%-7% increase over scenarios that do not incorporate ambient air impacts. Adaptation strategies to lower water use include the use of advanced cooling technologies and greater dependence on solar and wind. Water consumption may be reduced by 50% in 2095 from the reference from an increase in dry cooling shares to 35- 40%. This reduction could also be achieved through solar and wind power generation constituting 60% of the grid, necessitating a 250% in technology learning rates. Chapter 3 analyzes the economic feasibility of retrofitting carbon capture and storage (CCS) to existing coal-fired electricity generating units (EGUs) in Texas for compliance with the Clean Power Plan's rate-based emission standards under an emission trading scheme. Using a database of 18 technologically capable EGUs in Texas, CCS retrofits are modeled under a range of scenarios. Through an emission rate credit (ERC) marketplace, units enlisting the use of 90% capture of CO2 would prove to be more profitable than existing units at average prices of $27.8 per MWh under the final state standard. The combination of ERC trading and CO2 utilization can greatly reinforce economic incentives and market demands for CCS to accelerate large-scale deployment, even under scenarios with high retrofit costs. This chapter additionally compares the costs of electricity generation between CCS retrofits and renewable technology under the trading scheme, finding that EGUs retrofitted with CCS may not only be competitive with wind and solar, but more profitable under certain market conditions.",5/1/16,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,The Future of Low Carbon Electric Power Generation,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723599.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the demand side, increasing temperatures may result in shifting electricity consumption patterns and increase need for energy. On the supply side, changes in air temperatures, water availability, and water temperatures could reduce the capacity and effi?ciency of thermal units, which currently represent 85% of generating capacity. Previous studies that analyze climate change effects in the power sector have mostly focused on analyzing these risks separately. Further, studies in the supply side risks usually looked only at eff?ects of climate change only in existing thermal generators. However, such studies fail to capture how these demand and supply risks interact with each other and with the operation of the power grid in general. In order to analyze these risks in more detail, it is important to integrate them into system-wide assessments. Such assessments should take into account theeconomic dispatch of the complete generator effect and future economic decisions to expand this effect. This dissertation attempts to understand how climate change will aff?ect the power sector in the U.S. We implemented an integrated framework where we use di?fferent modelingmethods to represent the diff?erent risks the power sector faces due to climate change. We used our modeling framework in a case study of the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), one of eight regional electric reliability councils under North American Electric Reliability Corporation authority (NERC). Firstly, we used an econometric model to estimate changes in hourly electricity demand due to climate change. We used this model to analyze changes hourly electricity demand patterns in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) region for diff?erent seasons of the year. Our results suggest that climate change could result in an average increase in annual electricity consumption in the TVA region. However, this increase was not uniformly distributed throughout the year. During summer, total electricity consumption could increaseon average by 20% while during winter it may decrease on average by 6% by the end of the century. Secondly, we combined the estimates of future hourly electricity demand described in Chapter 2 with simulations of decreases in available capacity of thermal generators due to climatechange. We integrated these simulations in a capacity expansion (CE) model. This CE model is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that we adapted and developed for this study. It fi?nds the composition of the future generator effect that minimizes costs subject to the estimated eff?ects of climate change. We ran this model under different climate change scenarios from 2020 to 2050. Our results showed that by including these eff?ects due to climate change in the decision making process, the estimated participation of renewables in the generator effect in 2050 increased from 24% to over 37{40%. Solar power plants could become more economically attractive. As they have higher energy output during the summertime, they could help to o?set the climate-induced loss of thermal capacity during this season because of higher air and water temperatures. Thirdly, we simulated the operation of SERC's power system assuming the diff?erent scenarios and generator effects presented in Chapter 3. To accomplish this, we used a unit commitment and economic dispatch (UCED) model. The UECD model is a mixed integerlinear programming (MILP) model that we adapted and developed for this study. We used this model to investigate the tradeo?s between investing or not in the generator effect assuming diff?erent climate change scenarios. Our results suggest that by not including climate change eff?ects in the planning stage, SERC's power system could experience loss of load levels of 12% and overall energy costs could be 260% higher if climate change conditions do materialize by 2050.",3/30/20,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,5/20/25 15:36,,,,,,,Effects of Climate Change on the Power System,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/12000888.v1,,/Users/stacy/Zotero/storage/8JEIKNE8/Ralston Fonseca - 2020 - Effects of Climate Change on the Power System A Case Study of the Southeast U.S..pdf,,,/new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YYMGI6I9,thesis,2023,"Revel, Manon; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",Diversity and expertise in representative governance,,,,,,"Representative democracy is a widespread and essential part of democratic governance. Our understanding of it has been largely shaped by the triumph of elections that vest peripheral access to power through episodical polls. How would representative democracy look under different selection rules? In an attempt to reflect on foundational principles on which we could build a renewed case for representative democracy as democratic governance, this thesis explores democratic innovations for selecting representatives and focuses on the interplay between selection mechanisms, epistemic performance, and procedural aspects. The first chapter investigates the optimal number of voters needed to aggregate votes on a binary issue under majority rule. It takes an epistemic view where the issue at hand has a ground truth ""correct"" outcome and each one of    voters votes correctly with a fixed probability, known as their competence. Assuming that the best experts, i. e. , those with the highest competence, can be identified to form an epistemic congress, this chapter surprisingly shows that the optimal congress size should be linear in the population size, even with expert decision-making. The next chapters delve into the concept of liquid democracy, a governance mechanism in which citizens can either vote directly or delegate their votes to others, and examine the epistemic and procedural performances of this approach offering insights from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Taking an epistemic view, the second chapter highlights delegation scenarios where liquid democracy is likely to find the ground truth. It treats delegations as a stochastic process akin to well-known processes on random graphs --such as preferential attachment and multi-types branching process--and relate their dynamics to liquid democracy's performance. Along the way, it proves new bounds on the size of the largest component in an infinite Pólya urn process which may be of independent interest. The third chapter presents empirical experiments designed to compare liquid democracy with direct democracy, the counter-factual. It validates the theoretical findings of the second chapter, providing evidence that delegation mechanisms align with theoretical expectations. The fourth chapter analyzes delegation dynamics in a real-world setting and explores how liquid democracy functions in scenarios with contentious issues. It reveals insights into the patterns of delegation and the usage of liquid democracy in non-epistemic contexts. The fifth chapter reflects on lottocracy (selection of representatives at random) and proxy democracy (selection based on self-selection and flexible nominations that determine the relative influence of representatives) as two models to select representatives. It investigates the procedural aspects of both selection mechanisms exploring how inclusion, equality and legitimacy would be realized under lottocracy and proxy democracy. The sixth chapter, drawing on computational social choice, formulates a unified framework for comparing selection mechanisms. It devises a model in which different selection mechanisms can be formalized and evaluated axiomatically. It classifies selection mechanisms based on whether they are open-closed, flexible-rigid, and direct-virtual and propose the following five axioms: proportionality, diversity, monotonicity, faithfulness, and effectiveness. Throughout, the thesis intertwines insights from mathematics (social choice theory, applied probability, statistics), political philosophy, and empirical analyses to provide a comprehensive exploration of different facets of representative democracy. The interdisciplinary approach reflects the complexity and richness of democratic governance and calls for continued collaboration across disciplines to tackle its challenges and shape its future.",2023,5/22/25 18:17,5/22/25 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Diversity and expertise in representative governance,,,,,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institute for Data, Systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YZVWCIWM,thesis,2012,"Horowitz, Shira R.",Topics in Residential Electric Demand Response,,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Topics_in_Residential_Electric_Demand_Response/6723944/1,"Demand response and dynamic pricing are touted as ways to empower consumers, save consumers money, and capitalize on the “smart grid” and expensive advanced meter infrastructure. In this work, I attempt to show that demand response and dynamic pricing are more nuanced. Dynamic pricing is very appealing in theory but the reality of it is less clear. Customers do not always respond to prices. Price differentials are not always large enough for customers to save money. Quantifying energy that was not used is difficult. In chapter 2, I go into more detail on the potential benefits of demand response. I include a literature review of residential dynamic pilots and tariffs to see if there is evidence that consumers respond to dynamic rates, and assess the conditions that lead to a response. Chapter 3 explores equity issues with dynamic pricing. Flat rates have an inherent cross-subsidy built in because more peaky customers (who use proportionally more power when marginal price is high) and less peaky customers pay the same rates, regardless of the cost they impose on the system. A switch to dynamic pricing would remove this cross subsidy and have a significant distributional impact. I analyze this distributional impact under different levels of elasticity and capacity savings. Chapter 4 is an econometric analysis of the Commonwealth Edison RTP tariff. I show that it is extremely difficult to find the small signal of consumer response to price in all of the noise of everyday residential electricity usage. Chapter 5 looks at methods for forecasting, measuring, and verifying demand response in direct load control of air-conditioners. Forecasting is important for system planning. Measurement and verification are necessary to ensure that payments are fair. I have developed a new, censored regression based model for forecasting the available direct load control resource. This forecast can be used for measurement and verification to determine AC load in the counterfactual where DLC is not applied. This method is more accurate than the typical moving averages used by most ISO’s, and is simple, easy, and cheap to implement.",12/1/12,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:30,,,,,,,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6723944.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game seeks to understand the negotiation process in defense contracting and is used to facilitate and record the participants' movement through the tradespace. From a game theory perspective, we analyzed the non-Pareto dominant movements through the tradespace and found that humans explore the space by sliding along fronts until they reach an optimal and then jumping to another front to negotiate another optimal point.

The use of electronic health records (EHR) is one promising system-level initiative that may improve provider performance, interdisciplinary communication, reduce adverse patient events, improve the overall quality of patient care, and ultimately improve patient satisfaction with hospital care. The study purpose was to examine the relationships among: (1) EHR adoption stage, (2) missed nursing care and (3) nursing practice environment, on hospitalized patient adverse outcomes and satisfaction. This secondary analysis of cross sectional data was compiled from four sources: (1) the State Inpatient Database, (2) Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Dorenfest Institute database of EHR adoption, (3) Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey, and (4) a survey of New Jersey hospital-based nurses. The analytic approach used ordinary least squares and multiple regression models to estimate the effects of EHR adoption on the delivery of nursing care and patient outcomes, controlling for characteristics of patients, nurses, and hospitals. Robust procedures with Huber-White sandwich variance estimators and clustered means were used to account for the clustering of patients within hospitals. The final analytic sample consisted of 854,258 patients and 7,679 nurses in 70 New Jersey hospitals. Significant findings from this study indicate positive relationships between nursing practice environment and patient satisfaction, and inverse relationships between: (a) advanced EHR adoption and adverse outcome of prolonged length of stay, (b) nursing practice environment and missed nursing care and (c) missed nursing care and patient satisfaction. Among the subscales of the nursing practice environment tested, staffing and resource adequacy was the strongest predictor of missed nursing care and patient satisfaction. Further, findings indicate strong, significant relationships among staffing and resource adequacy, missed nursing care and patient satisfaction, and that these strong relationships are not confounding the effects of EHR adoption stage on patient satisfaction. These important findings suggest that sufficient staffing and resources is essential for advanced EHR adoption and patient reported outcomes of satisfaction. These findings may also signify that the patient benefits of advanced technology will only be realized in context of sufficient human resources.",2014,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,5/22/25 18:21,,,,,,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,Ann Arbor,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,,Book Title: Impact of health information technology on delivery and quality of patient care ISBN: 9781321206968,,,,,Health services administration; Information technology; Nursing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Economic subsidies and policy mandates for producing biomasssourcedfuels and electricity could increase further the human appropriation of planetary netprimary productivity. After reviewing the magnitude of organic byproducts available asfeedstock, and presenting a model of the climate impact of organic waste management, thisdissertation focuses on the climate impact of the main biomass consumers in the United States:livestock, including beef and dairy cattle, chickens (for meat and eggs), pigs and turkeys.Existing estimates of feed consumption by livestock are synthesized, showing that beef cattle inparticular are large consumers of cellulosic biomass in the form of hay and grazed roughage. Ithen determine the extent to which harvesting energy from animal manure can reduce and offsetthe greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from producing animal products. Finally, a life cycleassessment (LCA) of an integrated animal product and bioenergy facility is presented. Biomassflows and global warming potential (GWP) are modeled for two systems: one where the animalproduction and bioenergy facilities are distinct and one where the facilities are integrated. Theanimal production system includes a mix of animals. Such a system may be able to moreefficiently utilize byproducts from each system, but increasing the concentration of animals andmanure nutrients may make such a system difficult to implement",5/1/11,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:25,,,,,,,Climate implications of biomass appropriation,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6715115.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ZHYZSLYQ,thesis,2013,"Forestier, Cristobal A. Cheyre","Inventor Mobility, Knowledge Spillovers and Spinoff Entry in the U.S. Semiconductor Industry: Regional Patterns, Determinants, and Learning Implications",,,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Inventor_Mobility_Knowledge_Spillovers_and_Spinoff_Entry_in_the_U_S_Semiconductor_Industry_Regional_Patterns_Determinants_and_Learning_Implications/6720284/1,"This dissertation systematically analyzes the link between inventor mobility and knowledge diffusion in the semiconductor industry. It looks at how incumbents and recent entrants benefit from hiring inventors by analyzing geographical mobility patterns, the determinants of inventor mobility, and the types of learning that results from hiring. The analysis is based on data on the origins of all semiconductor producers with larger sales, and on patent filings and patent citations. Three papers comprise the dissertation. The first paper argues that the higher mobility of inventors in Silicon Valley can be explained mostly through the rate of spinoff entry in the region. The empirical evidence shows that inventor mobility was high in Silicon Valley since spinoffs started entering in large numbers, which happened before the industry clustered there. Agglomeration economies and the ban of non-compete covenants can facilitate the continued entry of spinoffs, but they cannot explain the initial wave of entry. Further evidence of the effect of entry on mobility rates is provided by spinoffs outside of Silicon Valley, which also hire many inventors from their parents and other local firms. The second paper identifies and tests several drivers of worker turnover associated with matching and learning. Incumbents, recent entrants, and spinoffs have different goals when hiring experienced inventors. Incumbents hire many workers without prior patents, while younger firms hire mostly experienced inventors. For inventors hired by incumbents, the main determinant is matching. Instead, movements from parent to spinoffs seem to be motivated by the acquisition of knowledge from the parent. None of the drivers previously identified seem to apply to recent entrants. The last paper analyzes the effect of hiring experienced inventors on the citations made by the hiring firm. In movements to incumbents, or from parent to spinoffs, there is an increase in citations from the hiring to the origin firm. However, movements to recent entrants are associated with increases in citations to other firms. This is related to what firms learn from hiring. While incumbents and spinoff access firm specific knowledge from moving inventors, recent entrants seem to be more concerned with the knowledge about the industry that the inventor possesses.",8/1/13,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:34,5/20/25 15:28,,,,,,,"Inventor Mobility, Knowledge Spillovers and Spinoff Entry in the U.S. Semiconductor Industry",,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,,en,,thesis,,,kilthub.cmu.edu,,DOI: 10.1184/R1/6720284.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ZYADKVIQ,thesis,2010,"Caref, Carol",The Relevance of Racism to the Mathematics Experiences of African American Students in an Intensely Segregated Low Income School,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/746772958?pq-origsite=primo,"Society's failure to educate proportionate numbers of African American students in mathematics is an ongoing problem. The roots of this problem lie in systemic racism and segregated schools. The overwhelming majority of economically disadvantaged African American high school students at segregated schools receive substandard mathematics education. One part of this study consists of analysis of Chicago Public Schools (CPS) data, showing vast inequities in the education delivered to the 72% of African American CPS students who attend segregated schools. Data from interviews of 24 freshmen in low-level algebra classes at one such CPS school support the major part of this study. The interviewees answer questions about their experiences as mathematics students and as African Americans. Results of this study found students to be teacher dependent, to approach math lessons as unconnected to previous knowledge, and to take a narrow view towards the value of mathematics. Students had not encountered autonomous learning in mathematics, learned to approach difficult problems with confidence and perseverance nor experienced the joy of solving a challenging problem. While students are aware of racism's existence, they are unclear about how it affects them directly. Students do not recognize that the segregated schools and neighborhoods of their lives are a result of racism. They accept their substandard education as normal and are uncritical of their schools. Students repeat anti-Black stereotypes about fellow students in relation to violence, interest in education, and self-responsibility. Mathematics educators need to be aware of the social context of math education. Segregated, economically disadvantaged African American students are likely to have learned teacher-dependence and narrow approaches to mathematics. It is therefore crucial that teachers develop lessons and practices aimed at moving students in the opposite direction, to become independent conceptual thinkers. This is no simple task, particularly for students who have developed these practices over many years of school. Researchers can prioritize the development of autonomy-building, conceptually based lessons and practices and school systems can support teachers' collaborative efforts in this regard.

ZYGASA6J,thesis,2012,"Miller, Travis Reed; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program",Quantitative characterization of transboundary flows of used electronics: a case study of the United States,,,,,,"Despite growing interest and concern surrounding transboundary movements of used electronics around the world, there is a dearth of data on their movements. Although a multitude of different data sources exist, coherent sets of information on used electronics and their movement are lacking because of inherent challenges in obtaining such information. In spite of these challenges, a characterization of the sources, destinations, and quantities of used electronics flows would inform strategic decision-making of numerous stakeholders. A variety of approaches were reviewed for their potential to form a comprehensive quantitative characterization of used electronics generation, collection in the United States and export from the United States. First, the sales obsolescence method was selected to stochastically estimate the generation of used electronics. Collection rates were modeled and applied to the generation results; the collection results serve as upper bounds on export estimates. The export approaches chosen are applicable to all used electronics product types and give insight into the destinations of the exports. Despite concerns about the reliability of export trade data, the trade data approach was selected because of the abundance of available data for recent decades. The Bayesian Truth Serum Survey of Used Electronics Processors approach was selected for its ability to inform quantitative and qualitative characterizations with moderate effort. Comprehensive datasets were not as available for more reliable approaches. The generation and collection approaches were applied to the case of used laptop computers in the United States in 2010. Approximately 22 million laptops were generated and 12 million used laptops were collected. Uncertainty parameters were modeled for each estimate. Additional data sources, such as owner surveys, are necessary to create quality estimates of other types of used electronics since data is less available. The results of the two export approaches diverged. The trade data approach is believed to provide an underestimate, and resulted in a mean estimate of 0.9 million exported used laptops. The results of the survey, combined with collection estimates, resulted in an estimate of 6.0 to 12.0 million exported used laptops.",2012,5/22/25 18:28,5/22/25 18:28,,,,,,,,Quantitative characterization of transboundary flows of used electronics,,,,,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division",,eng,,,,,mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,THESIS Thesis ESD 2012 S.M.,Book Title: Quantitative characterization of transboundary flows of used electronics : a case study of the United States,,,,,,,,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering Systems Division; Technology and Policy Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
